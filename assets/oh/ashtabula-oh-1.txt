EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

newspapers to submit sealed bids for such publishing together with their
published rate card for commercial advertising, and a sworn statement of their
bona fide net paid circulation within the City of Ashtabula, and in making such
designation the Council shall take into consideration both the rate and

newspaper so designated, but not larger than 8-point type and 9-point body,

carrying any or all of such publications shall be paid for the quantity of
space used at a rate no higher than it charges for the same space for
commercial display advertising. Whenever it may appear to the Council that the

by resolution determine.
(Amended 5-19-80)
SECTION 18 SALARIES AND BONDS.
   The Council shall fix by ordinance the salary rate of compensation of all
officers and employees of the City entitled to compensation except as otherwise
provided in this Charter; but this shall not prevent the City from securing the
services of special or temporary employees who shall receive such compensation

amount as it may determine, and it may provide that the premium thereof shall

Council.
   No member of the Council, the City Manager, or other officer or employee of
the City shall knowingly accept any gift, frank, free ticket, pass, reduced
price, or reduced rate of service from any person, firm, or corporation
operating a public utility or engaged in business of a public nature within the

INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM
SECTION 20 THE INITIATIVE.
   Any proposed ordinance may be submitted to the Council by petition signed by
electors of the City equal in number to 10% of the total number of registered
electors therein. All petition papers, circulated with respect to any proposed
ordinance, shall be uniform in character, and shall contain the proposed
ordinance in full, and the names and addresses of at least 5 electors who shall
be officially regarded as filing the petition and shall constitute a committee
of the petitioners for the purpose hereinafter named.
   Each signer of a petition shall sign his name in ink or indelible pencil,
and shall place on the petition paper after his name his place of residence by
street and number, and the date of signing. The signatures to any such petition
need not all be appended to one paper but to each such paper there shall be
attached an affidavit by the circulator thereof stating the number of signers
to such part of the petition and that each signature appended to the paper is
the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be, and was made
in the presence of the affiant and on the date indicated. No person shall sign
more than one petition paper for the same purpose.
   Before any ordinance so proposed shall be submitted to the Council, its form
shall be approved by the City Solicitor, who shall endorse his approval
thereon; and it shall be the duty of the City Solicitor to draft any such
proposed ordinance in proper legal language and to render such other services
to persons desiring to propose such ordinance as shall be necessary to make the
same proper for consideration by the Council.
   All papers comprising a petition shall be assembled and filed with the Clerk
of the Council as one instrument within 120 days from the date of the first
signature thereon. Within 10 days from the filing of such petition the Clerk
shall endorse thereon a certificate showing the number of signatures of
qualified electors contained therein and the number required.
   If the Clerk's certificate shows that the petition is insufficient he shall
at once notify each member of the committee of the petitioners, hereinbefore
provided for, and the petition may be supplemented at any time within 15 days
from the date of such notification by filing with the Clerk an additional
petition paper or papers in the same manner as provided for the original
petition.
   Upon the filing of such supplemental petition the Clerk shall, within 10
days thereafter, attach thereto his certificate as hereinbefore required. If
the petition as so supplemented is still insufficient or if no supplement shall
have been filed, the Clerk shall file the petition in his office and shall
notify each member of the committee of that fact. The final finding of the
insufficiency of a petition shall not prejudice the filing of a new petition
for the same purpose.
   When the certificate of the Clerk shows the petition to be sufficient, he
shall submit the proposed ordinance to the Council at its next regular meeting
and the Council shall take final action thereon within 30 days from the date of
such submission. If the Council rejects the proposed ordinance, or passes it in
a form different from that set forth in the petition, the committee of the
petitioners may require that it be submitted to a vote of the electors in its
original form, or that it be submitted to a vote of the electors with any
proposed change, addition, or amendment, which was presented to Council in
writing by said committee during the consideration thereof by the Council.
   When an ordinance proposed by petition is to be submitted to a vote of the
electors the committee of the petitioners shall certify that fact and the
proposed ordinance to the Clerk of the Council within 40 days after the
submission of such proposed ordinance to the Council.
   Upon receipt of the certificate and certified copy of the proposed
ordinance, the Clerk shall certify that fact to the Council at its next regular
meeting. If no election is to be held within 6 months and more than 30 days
after the receipt of the Clerk's certificate by the Council, the Council may
provide for submitting the proposed ordinance to the electors at a special
election. If a supplemental petition, signed by electors equal in number to 25%
of the total number of registered electors in the Municipality other than and
in addition to those who signed the original petition, be filed with the Clerk
asking that the proposed ordinance be submitted to the voters at a time
indicated in such petition, the Council shall provide for a special election at
such time. The sufficiency of any such petition shall be determined, and it may
be supplemented, in a manner hereinbefore provided for original petitions for
proposing ordinances to the Council. If no other provision be made as to the
time of submitting a proposed ordinance to a vote of the electors, it shall be
submitted at the next election.
   The ballots used when voting upon any such proposed ordinance shall state
the title of the ordinance to be voted on and below it the 2 propositions, "For
the Ordinance" and "Against the Ordinance". Immediately at the left of each
proposition there shall be a square in which by making a cross (X) the voter
may vote for or against the proposed ordinance. If a majority of the qualified
electors voting on any such proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, it
shall thereupon become an ordinance of the City.
   No ordinance adopted by an electoral vote shall be repealed or amended
except by an electoral vote, but an ordinance to repeal or amend any such
ordinance, may by resolution of the Council, be submitted to an electoral vote
on the day of any regular or special election or at a special municipal
election called for that purpose, provided notice of the intention so to do be
published by Council not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to such
election in the manner required for the publication of ordinances. If an
amendment is so proposed, such notice shall contain the proposed amendment in
full. Such submission shall be in the same manner, and the vote shall have the
same effect, as in cases of ordinances submitted to an election by popular
petition.
   Proposed ordinances for repealing any existing ordinance or ordinances in
whole or in part, or amending the same, may be submitted to the Council as
provided in the preceding sections for initiating ordinances.

divisions of all departments, and shall give in parallel columns the following
information:
   (a)   A detailed estimate of the expense of conducting each department as
submitted by the department.
   (b)   Expenditures for corresponding items for the last 2 fiscal years.
   (c)   Expenditures for corresponding items for the current fiscal year,
including adjustments due to transfers between appropriations plus an estimate
of expenditures necessary to complete the current fiscal year.
   (d)   Amount of supplies and material on hand at the date of the preparation
of the invoice.
   (e)   Increase or decrease of requests compared with the corresponding
appropriations for the current year.

balances at any time remaining after the purposes of the appropriation shall
have been satisfied or abandoned, may from time to time be appropriated by the
Council to such uses as will not conflict with any uses for which such revenues
specifically accrued. No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the City,
nor shall any obligation for the expenditure of money be incurred, except

Municipality, or any other person, and examine him upon oath or affirmation
relative thereto.

or to the proper officer, as the case may be, that the money required for such
contract, agreement, obligation, or expenditure, is in the Treasury, to the
credit of the fund from which it is to be drawn, and not appropriated for any
other purpose, which certificate shall be filed and immediately recorded. The

amount thereof which may be prescribed by the general laws of the State
applicable to municipalities and in force at the time it is determined by the
Council that any such work shall be done or improvement made. Unless for

of any such street improvement unless with the consent of 5 members of the
Council, expressed by resolution adopted at a regular meeting of the Council

assessed against the lots and lands specially benefited thereby.

and signed by the contractor and by the City Manager and approved by the
Council.

any value for the grant. Nothing in such ordinance shall prevent the City from
acquiring such property by condemnation proceedings or in any other lawful
mode, but such rights and remedies shall be in addition to those reserved in
such ordinance. Upon the acquisition of such property by purchase,
condemnation, or otherwise all grants shall at once terminate.

upon the rights of the property owners in such highways or public grounds.
SECTION 74 RIGHT OF REGULATION.
   All grants shall be subject to the right of the City, whether in terms
reserved or not, to control at all times the distribution of space in, over,

renew the pavements between the rails, and the tracks, and for a distance of

the same as the prior ordinance.

they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

113.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)   "Deteriorating area" means either:
      (1)   An area, whether predominantly built up or open, which is not a
slum, blighted or deteriorated area but which because of incompatible land
uses, nonconforming uses, lack of adequate parking facilities, faulty street
arrangement, obsolete platting, inadequate community and public utilities,
diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, increased density of population
without commensurate increases in new residential building and community
facilities, high turnover in residential or commercial occupancy, lack of
maintenance and repair of buildings, or any combination thereof, is detrimental
to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare, and which will
deteriorate or is in danger of deteriorating into a slum, blighted or
deteriorated area; or
      (2)   An area consisting principally of land in highways, railway or
subway tracks, bridge or tunnel entrances, or other similar facilities which
have a blighting influence on the surrounding area and over which air right
sites can be developed thereby eliminating such blighting influence.
   (b)   "General Neighborhood Renewal Plan". The plan and program as it exists
from time to time, for the urban renewal or redevelopment of a general
neighborhood renewal area. The general neighborhood renewal plan need not
contain all of the required contents set forth in Section
113.06 with respect to an urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan.
Approval of the general neighborhood renewal plan by Council does not create
authority to carry out project execution activities.

area has been platted in whole or in part does not prevent its classification
as open space land.

area with overcrowding or improper location of structures on the land,
excessive dwelling unit density, detrimental land uses or conditions, unsafe,
congested, poorly designed streets, or inadequate public facilities or

the community, are conducive to ill health, transmission of disease, infant
mortality, juvenile delinquency and crime, and are detrimental to the public
health, safety, morals and general welfare.
   (j)   "Slum clearance" or "clearance" or "urban redevelopment" means those
undertakings and activities identified in subsection (m)(1), (2), (3), (4) and
(7) hereof.

City, with or without federal or State aid or assistance for developing
undertaking and carrying out of urban renewal or redevelopment programs and
projects, including all planning and other related activities of the City in
connection therewith, or any part of such activities.

         (1980 Code 38.01; Ord. 5777)
113.02 NECESSITY OF URBAN RENEWAL.
   (a)   It is found and determined that there exists within the City, slum,
blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas of the nature defined in this
chapter which constitutes a serious and growing menace, injurious and
inimicable to the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the
residents thereof; that the existence of such areas:
      (1)   Contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease
and crime and to losses by fire and accident, necessitating excessive and
disproportionate expenditures of public funds for the preservation of the
public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution and
punishment, for the treatment of juvenile delinquency, for the maintenance of
adequate police, fire and accident protection, and other public services and
facilities;
      (2)   Constitutes an economic and social liability; and
      (3)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the
community, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic
problems, and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic
hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities.
   (b)   This menace is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and exercise of the police power, and cannot be dealt with
effectively by the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
herein provided. The elimination in whole or in part of slum, blighted,
deteriorated and deteriorating areas, and the prevention of occurrence or
recurrence of such areas by redevelopment and by the conservation,
rehabilitation and reconditioning to the extent feasible, of the salvageable
portions of such areas, and by other activities pursuant to urban redevelopment
or urban renewal as defined herein, are public uses and purposes for which
public money may be expended and private property acquired by purchase, by
donation and by eminent domain and are governmental functions of concern to the
City and require the exercise of the powers of government granted to the City
by the provisions of Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution. The necessity in
the public interest and general welfare, for the provisions of this chapter, is
declared as a matter of legislative determination.
(1980 Code 38.02; Ord. 5777)
113.03 COUNCIL POLICY ON URBAN REDEVELOPMENT AND RENEWAL.
   It is declared to be the policy of Council to promote and encourage the
sound development, including renewal and redevelopment where necessary, of the
entire City in accordance with the general plan for the City. Council realizes
that the City government will be unable to carry out coordinated and effective
programs for renewing the City without the cooperation and support of the
public as a whole. Therefore, Council stands ready to cooperate with private
enterprise, civic groups, neighborhood agencies and governmental agencies in
developing and carrying out urban renewal programs and projects to promote the
sound development of new areas to prevent the spread of slums and blight, and
to eliminate slums, blighted, deteriorated and deteriorating areas in the City.
(1980 Code 38.03; Ord. 5777)
113.04 PREPARATION OF GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD RENEWAL, URBAN RENEWAL OR URBAN
REDEVELOPMENT STUDIES AND PLANS.
   (a)   Upon the recommendation of the City Manager and approval by the City
Planning Commission and where the contract involves an expenditure in excess of
one thousand dollars ($1,000) as authorized by Council, the Director of Urban
Renewal shall enter into such contracts, on behalf of the City, with engineers,
architects and other professional services as may be necessary to provide the
necessary inspections, studies, plans, surveys and reports in connection with
the preparation of the general neighborhood renewal plan and in connection with
the urban renewal or redevelopment activities to be undertaken by the City to
the extent that funds have been appropriated therefor. The Planning Commission
may itself conduct such inspections, studies, plans, surveys and reports.
   (b)   When studies, plans, surveys or reports pursuant to subsection (a)
hereof have been prepared, they shall be submitted to Council and filed as
provided from time to time.
(1980 Code 38.04; Ord. 5777)
113.05 CONTENTS OF URBAN RENEWAL OR URBAN REDEVELOPMENT PLAN AND RELOCATION
PLAN, OR SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION.
      (a)   Any urban renewal or redevelopment plan hereafter prepared shall be
prepared in such detail as to clearly set forth sufficient information to
permit the Planning Commission to exercise its power of approval or disapproval
under Ohio R.C. 713.02, and in any event such plans shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
      (1)   A description of the boundaries of the project area;
      (2)   A land-use plan showing the location, character and extent of
public and private land ownership, utilities, use and occupancy proposed within
the area;
      (3)   A delineation of areas of land acquisition, demolition and removal
of structures or of rehabilitation, conservation or reconditioning of existing
structures, if any, as may be proposed to be carried out in the project area;
and
      (4)   A statement indicating the controls and the use, development and
building restrictions to be placed on the property in the project area to
prevent a recurrence of slum or blighted conditions.
   (b)   In addition thereto, such plan or its supporting documentation shall
include but shall not be limited to, the following:
      (1)   A report showing the proposed changes, if any in the building,
housing or zoning ordinances or maps and street layout, levels or grades;
      (2)   A statement from the appropriate City official or officials setting
forth the capability of the City to finance the portion of the project costs to
be contributed by the City; and
      (3)   A statement of the relationship of the plan to such definite
objectives of the City respecting appropriate land uses, improved traffic
conditions, and transportation, public utilities, recreation and community
facilities, and other public improvements.
   (c)   A relocation plan shall indicate a feasible method for the temporary
relocation of individuals and families displaced from the project area, and an
assurance that there are or are being provided in the project area or in other
areas not generally less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and
commercial facilities and at rents or prices within the financial means of the
individuals and families to be displaced from the project area, decent, safe,
sanitary dwellings equal in number to, available to, and reasonably accessible
to the work places of the number of displaced individuals and families.
(1980 Code 38.05; Ord. 5777)
113.06 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   When a general neighborhood renewal plan or an urban renewal or urban
redevelopment plan and the supporting documentation therefor is filed with
Council, Council shall refer the plan and supporting documentation to the
Planning Commission of the City for its review and recommendations, approval or
disapproval under Ohio R.C. 713.02 and its certification as to whether or not
the plan is in conformity with the general plan of the City. To refer the plan
to the Commission, a copy of the plan and supporting documentation shall be
delivered to the person charged with the preparation and custody of the record
of the proceedings of the Commission.
   (b)   The Commission shall submit in writing to Council its approval or
recommendations concerning the plan. The approval of the Commission shall also
constitute its approval of those matters placed under its jurisdiction by Ohio
R.C. 713.02, except as the recommendations of the Commission may include a
disapproval pursuant to such section. Unless recommendations or disapprovals
are received from the Commission on or before the thirtieth day after the day
of delivery to the person charged with the preparation and custody of the
record of proceedings of the Commission of the plan and supporting
documentation, the plan shall be conclusively presumed to have been approved by
the Commission.
(1980 Code 38.06; Ord. 5777)
113.07 PUBLIC HEARING AND COUNCIL ACTION.
   (a)   Council, before approving a general neighborhood renewal plan or an
urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, shall hold a public hearing on the
plan at which an opportunity shall be provided to all persons interested to be
heard either in person or by counsel. The hearing may be adjourned from time to
time. Notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for two consecutive
weeks on the same day of the week. At least seven full days shall elapse
between the second publication and the date set for the public hearing. The
notice shall also contain a description of the project area by its location in
relation to highways, streets, watercourses or other natural or artificial
boundaries, and shall also designate the place at which the plan, maps, plats
and other materials describing the project area are and shall be available for
public inspection.
   (b)   Following the completion of the public hearings, Council may either
approve or reject the general neighborhood renewal plan or the urban renewal or
urban redevelopment plan, or make modifications and approve the plan as
modified; provided that:
      (1)   The boundaries of the project area are extended to include any
land, except land contained within the right-of-way lines of a dedicated street
or alley, not included in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan upon
which the public hearing was held pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, or if
there is added a type of urban renewal or redevelopment activity not included
in such urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan which requires the
acquisition of property, or if there is any change in land use or redevelopment
restrictions contained in such urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, a
public hearing shall be held on such urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan
as modified prior to the approval thereof by Council in accordance with the
provisions of subsection(a) hereof; and
      (2)   If such modifications are other than in accordance with the
recommendations of the Planning Commission, such general neighborhood renewal
plan or urban renewal plan or urban redevelopment plan as modified shall be
resubmitted to the Commission for its written approval or recommendations
pursuant to the provisions of Section
113.06 .
   (c)   When Council wishes to approve a general neighborhood renewal plan or
an urban renewal or redevelopment plan, it shall do so by ordinance passed by
not less than a majority vote, after reading in full at two regular meetings
not less than one week apart, or under suspension of rules pursuant to Charter
Section 13. However, if the plan has not been approved by the Commission, or if
there were any partial disapprovals or by or adverse recommendations of the
Commission under Ohio R.C. 713.02, not accepted by Council by its modifications
of the plan in accordance therewith, then an affirmative vote of two thirds of
the members of Council shall be required to pass the ordinance. To the extent
that such disapproval involves the construction of an improvement or utility
within the meaning of Ohio R.C. 713.02, the concurrence of the head of the
department or departments having control of the construction of such proposed
improvement or utility shall also be necessary.
   (d)   The ordinance of Council approving a general neighborhood renewal plan
should contain a finding that the plan conforms to the general plan and to the
workable program of the City and such other findings as may be necessary or
desirable, but need not contain the other findings set forth in subsection (e)
hereof for approval of urban renewal or redevelopment plans. The approval of a
general neighborhood renewal plan may be made before or at the same time as the
approval of an urban renewal or redevelopment plan for a project within the
general neighborhood renewal area.
   (e)   The ordinance of Council approving an urban renewal or redevelopment
plan shall include the following findings:
      (1)   Specific findings of fact as to the conditions in the project area
which make it a slum, blighted, deteriorated or deteriorating area, and
findings that the project area is a slum, blighted, deteriorated or
deteriorating area;
      (2)   That the size and character of the area and the location of
elements of slum, blight and deterioration in the area make it appropriate for
urban renewal activities;
      (3)   That the proposals for the proper relocation of individuals and
families displaced in carrying out the project in decent, safe and sanitary
dwellings in conformity with acceptable standards are feasible and can be
reasonably and timely effected to permit the proper prosecution and completion
of the project. That the dwellings or dwelling units available or to be made
available to the displaced individuals and families are at least equal in
number to the number of displaced individuals and families, are not generally
less desirable in regard to public utilities and public and commercial
facilities than the dwellings of the displaced individuals and families in the
project area, are available at rents or prices within the financial means of
the displaced individuals and families, and are reasonably accessible to their
places of employment;
      (4)   If federal aid is needed that financial aid to be provided by the
federal government under its contract is necessary to enable the project to be
undertaken in accordance with the plan;
      (5)   That the plan for the project area shall afford maximum opportunity
consistent with the sound needs of the community as a whole for the
rehabilitation or redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise;
      (6)   That the plan conforms to the existing general or master plan for
the overall development of the City as prepared by the Planning Commission
pursuant to the ordinances of the City and Ohio R.C. 713.02;
      (7)   That the plans gives due consideration to the provision of adequate
park and recreational areas and facilities as may be desirable for neighborhood
improvement, with special consideration for the health, safety and welfare of
the children residing in the general vicinity of the site covered by the plan;
      (8)   If there is included in the plan any provision permitting the new
construction of hotels, motels or other housing for transient use, that the
City has caused to be made a competent independent analysis of the local supply
of transient housing and as a result thereof determines that there exists in
the project area a need for additional units of such housing;
      (9)   If the project area is not predominantly residential in character
and is not to be redeveloped for predominantly residential use, that the
redevelopment of the project area for predominantly nonresidential uses is
necessary for the proper development, of the community.
      (10)   Where an open space land program is involved, that the land and
the interests in land to be acquired are for the purposes of preserving the
area as open space land and are necessary to orderly long range development, to
curb urban sprawl and the spread of urban blight and deterioration, to
encourage more economical and desirable urban development, and to provide areas
for parks, playgrounds, parkways, conservation areas and watersheds and to
preserve natural resources. The area so acquired is to be of a size and
character appropriate for such purposes;
      (11)   If federal aid is involved and clearing is the sole treatment
proposed, that the objectives of the urban renewal plan cannot be achieved
through rehabilitation of the urban renewal area;
      (12)   If federal aid is involved and both clearance and rehabilitation
treatment are proposed, that the objectives of the urban renewal plan cannot be
achieved through more extensive rehabilitation of the urban renewal area;
      (13)   If federal aid is involved, that the United States and the Housing
and Home Finance Administrator be assured of full compliance by the City with
regulations of the Housing and Home Finance Agency effectuating Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964; and
      (14)   Where an educational institution or a hospital is located in or
near the project area and it is desired to utilize Section 112 of the Housing
Act of 1949, as amended, that in addition to the elimination of slums and
blight from the area, the undertaking of an urban renewal or urban
redevelopment project in the area shall further promote the public welfare and
the proper development of the community:
         A.   By making land in the area available for disposition, for uses in
accordance with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, to the
educational institution or hospital for redevelopment in accordance with the
uses specified in the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan;
         B.   By providing, through the redevelopment of the area in accordance
with the urban renewal or urban redevelopment plan, a cohesive neighborhood
environment compatible with the functions and needs of such educational
institution or hospital; or
         C.   By any combination of the foregoing.
   (f)   The Clerk of Council shall certify as true and correct and deliver to
the City Manager a copy of the aforesaid ordinance of Council, approving the
plan, for his approval or veto, and appropriate further action. Any documents
which were submitted to Council to support findings made in the ordinance
should be filed with a copy of the ordinance.
   (g)   The taking effect of the ordinance approving an urban renewal or
redevelopment plan shall constitute authority to spend moneys of the City
appropriated for carrying out urban renewal or redevelopment activities in
accordance with the plan, as well as the proceeds of bonds or notes issued for
such purpose, and to accept advances, gifts, donations and grants from the
federal government, the State any entity, instrumentality or subdivision of
either or from any other entity or person for such purpose.
(1980 Code 38.07; Ord. 5777)
113.08 FEDERAL AID CONTRACTS.
   Any contract with a federal agency for loans, advances, grants or other
federal aid to the City shall be approved by the counsel for the division of
urban renewal as to form and legality and, after approval and authorization by
ordinance of Council passed in accordance with the requirements of the Charter,
shall be executed by the City Manager.
(1980 Code 38.08; Ord. 6047)
113.09 MODIFICATION OF URBAN RENEWAL PLAN AND GENERAL NEIGHBORHOOD RENEWAL
PLAN.
   (a)   An approved urban renewal plan may be amended, modified or changed by
ordinance of Council from time to time; provided that if the boundaries of the
project area are intended to include any land, except land contained within the
right-of-way lines of a dedicated street or alley, not previously included
therein, if there is added a new type of urban renewal activity which requires
the acquisition of property, if there is any change in the land use or
redevelopment restrictions deemed by Council to be substantial, or if there is
any change in the proposed location, extent or character of a public
improvement or utility within the project area or in any other matter directly
within the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission to approve or disapprove
under Ohio R.C. 713.02 or if such amendment, modification or change is deemed
by Council to be a substantial change in the urban renewal or redevelopment
plan; then all of the proceedings provided for in Sections
113.06 and
113.07 shall be carried out in connection with the amendment, modification or
change except that the findings to be made in the ordinance approving the urban
renewal or urban redevelopment plan shall be altered to fit the then
circumstances. The land use or redevelopment restrictions applicable to any
land previously conveyed by the City may not be amended, modified or changed
without the consent of the property owner thereto.
   (b)   A general neighborhood renewal plan may be amended, modified or
changed by ordinance of Council from time to time; provided that any such
amendment, modification or change shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
for its written approval or recommendations pursuant to the provisions of
Section
113.06.
(1980 Code 38.09; Ord. 6859)
113.10 EXECUTION OF URBAN RENEWAL PROJECTS.
   (a)   Acquisition of Property. As authorized by Council and subject to the
control of the City Manager, the Director of Planning and Urban Renewal, with
the appropriate advice and assistance of the counsel for the Division of Urban
Renewal, shall cause the necessary steps to be taken to acquire the parcels of
land in the project area in accordance with the urban renewal or redevelopment
plan. The steps shall include, but not be limited to, the negotiation for such
parcels, obtaining appraisals, title examinations and reports, executing
contracts for any of such services and appropriate documents to transfer title
to the City, provided that in the event appropriation of property is necessary,
Council shall initiate and carry out the necessary proceedings with the
appropriate assistance of the several officers, employees, boards and
commissions of the City. Acquisition may take place at any time after
compliance with Sections 
113.06  and
113.07 .
   (b)   City Activities Preparing Property for Disposition. After any
necessary appropriations of City moneys and authorization of expenditures by
ordinances of Council, Council action, where appropriate, to rezone property,
vacate or dedicate streets or other public places and provide for the
establishment and preservation of open space areas, certification of funds by
the City Auditor, where appropriate, and preparation of or approval of legal
forms of contracts by the counsel for the Division of Urban Renewal, and
subject to the control of the City Manager, the Director of Planning and Urban
Renewal shall make the contracts, provide the labor, direct the City Purchasing
Agent to purchase the supplies and materials for such City activities as may be
necessary to carry out the urban renewal project. Activities shall include, but
not be limited to, the demolition, rehabilitation or repair of structures
whether voluntarily by the private owners thereof or by the City for
demonstration purposes in limited numbers; the removal of pavement, sidewalks,
lighting and trees; capping, removal and relocation of City-owned utility

   (c)   Disposition of Property. Council may authorize by ordinance the
transfer, lease or conveyance of any real property in accordance with and for
the purposes of the plan, subject to such lawful terms, conditions,
restrictions and covenants, including covenants running with the land, to
assist in carrying out the purposes of the plan. All dispositions of real
property shall be at not less than the fair value thereof determined by Council
based upon the proposed new uses and restrictions thereon to be imposed thereon
under the urban renewal plan by Council through zoning ordinances, private
covenant or otherwise. The determination shall be made only after obtaining
independent appraisals of such fair value upon the aforesaid bases, which
appraisals shall not be binding upon the City. The manner of disposition shall
be prescribed by ordinance, and may be by negotiation, with or without any
competitive bidding, and such competition and aware of a disposition contract
may be based on factors other than price alone. Publication of notice once a
week for not less than two nor more than four consecutive weeks in a newspaper

competitive bids or of the execution of a disposition contract without
competitive bidding. The financial and legal ability of those proposing to
acquire or lease such real property shall be considered in all dispositions.
The City Manager shall execute on behalf of the City, such instruments as may

the City Solicitor and authorized by Council. The form shall include all
covenants running with the land, including any portions of the plans
incorporated by reference. The City Manager shall execute any certificates of
completion of improvements or other appropriate instruments, on behalf of the

ascertained, as far as practicable, by competitive examination.
   (c)   If the City Manager determines that a current Civil Service list has
been exhausted and no further candidates acceptable for hire exist on said

and a new certified list obtained prior to filling a vacancy in the Police

person holding a current commission as a peace officer in a political
subdivision of the State of Ohio who has completed either three years of full-

(Ord. 2023-35. Passed 3-6-23.)
141.12 COSTS OF CONFINEMENT; REIMBURSEMENT.
   (a)    Any person convicted of an offense other than a minor misdemeanor
originating within the corporate limits of Ashtabula, Ohio, who is or was in
the custody of the City Police Department or was confined in the City Jail or
County Jail or any facility for which the City is charged any expenses, shall
reimburse the City of the City’s expenses incurred by reason of such person’s
confinement or custody, including, but are not limited to, the costs of
repairing property damaged by the prisoner while confined; a per diem fee for
room and board; medical and dental treatment costs; the fee for a random drug
test assessed under division (E) of section 341.26 and division (E) of section
753.33 of the Revised Code; a one-time reception fee for the costs of
processing the prisoner into the jail at the time of the prisoner's initial
entry under the confinement in question; and testing for HIV, hepatitis,
tuberculosis or other communicable disease.
   (b)    The per diem fee for room and board and the one-time reception fee
described above for the Ashtabula City Jail shall be determined from time to
time by the City Manager, who shall notify the Police Chief, the City
Solicitor, the City Finance Director and the Clerk of Council. Until otherwise
set by the Manager, the fee for room and board shall be $50.00 per diem, and
the one-time reception fee for the City Jail shall be $75.00. The reception fee
and one (1) days’ room and board may be deducted from the prisoner’s personal
property upon initial processing and confinement, provided a receipt is given
therefore which contains a written notice that the prisoner has 30 days within
which to contest said charge in accordance with paragraph (d) hereof. No
reception fee shall be assessed any prisoner who has been determined to be
indigent by a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (c)    The Ashtabula City Jail shall accept commitments for incarceration
from the Ashtabula Municipal Court for prisoners convicted of criminal
violations of the Codified Ordinances or the Revised Code as long as accepting
such a commitment does not cause any violation of regulations of the Ohio
Department of Corrections. The per diem charge for room and board set herein or
by the City Manager shall apply to all such commitments, but the reception fee
shall be waived. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to waive the right
of the City to be reimbursed by the prisoner for other costs of confinement as
described in paragraph (a) of this section.
   (d)    (1)    Each prisoner shall receive at the end of the prisoner's
confinement an itemized bill of the expenses to be reimbursed. The prisoner may
make periodic payments on a schedule to be implemented upon release, not to
exceed 180 days in duration. The bill also shall state that payment shall be
made to the person identified in the bill as the reimbursement coordinator and
include a notice that specifies that the prisoner has 30 days in which to
dispute the bill by filing a written objection with the reimbursement
coordinator and that if the prisoner does not dispute the bill in that manner
within that period, the prisoner is required to pay the bill and a certificate
of judgment may be obtained against the prisoner for the amount of the unpaid
expenses. The prisoner shall sign a copy of the bill, and the reimbursement
coordinator shall retain that copy. If the prisoner disputes an item on the
bill within 30 days after receiving the bill, the reimbursement coordinator may
either concede the disputed item or proceed to a hearing as set forth herein.
      (2)    If the prisoner disputes an item on an itemized bill presented to
the prisoner and the reimbursement coordinator does not concede the item, the
reimbursement coordinator shall submit the bill to the court, and the court
shall hold a hearing on the disputed items in the bill. At the end of the
hearing, the court shall determine how much of the disputed expenses the
prisoner shall reimburse the City and shall issue a judgment in favor of the
City for any undisputed expenses and the amount of the disputed expenses for
which the prisoner must reimburse the City. The reimbursement coordinator shall
not seek to enforce the judgment until at least 90 days after the court issues
the judgment.
      (3)    If a prisoner does not dispute the itemized bill presented to the
prisoner and does not pay the bill within 90 days, the reimbursement
coordinator shall send by mail a notice to the prisoner requesting payment of
the expenses as stated in the bill. If the prisoner does not respond to the
notice by paying the expenses in full within 30 days of the date the notice was
mailed, the reimbursement coordinator shall send by mail a second notice to the
prisoner requesting payment of the expenses. If 180 days elapse from the date
that the reimbursement coordinator provides the bill and if the prisoner has
not paid the full amount of the expenses pursuant to the bill and the notices,
the reimbursement coordinator may notify the clerk of the appropriate court of
those facts, and the clerk may issue a certificate of judgment against the
prisoner for the balance of the expenses remaining unpaid.
      (4)    The reimbursement coordinator may collect any amounts remaining
unpaid on an itemized bill and any costs associated with the enforcement of the
judgment and may enter into a contract with one or more public agencies or
private vendors to collect any amounts remaining unpaid. For enforcing a
judgment issued under this section, the reimbursement coordinator may assess an
additional poundage fee of 2% of the amount remaining unpaid and may collect
costs associated with the enforcement of the judgment.
      (5)    Neither the reimbursement coordinator nor the City shall enforce
any judgment obtained under this section by means of execution against the
prisoner's homestead. Any reimbursement received under this section shall be
credited to the general fund of the treasury of City, to be used for general
fund purposes.
      (6)    Reception fees and per diem charges may be paid in advance. Except
in the case of automatic deduction of the reception fee and one day’s board
from the prisoner’s property during initial processing, such payment shall be
deemed to be a waiver by the prisoner of any right to contest such charges.
Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to waive the right of the City to be
reimbursed by the prisoner for other costs of confinement as described in
paragraph (a) of this section.
         (Ord. 2014-44. Passed 4-7-14.)
141.13 FINGERPRINT/BACKGROUND CHECKS; FEES.

position shall be made at the entrance rate and advancement from the entrance
rate to the maximum rate within a pay range shall be by successive steps. Upon
recommendation of the City Manager, Council may approve initial compensation at
a rate higher than the minimum rate in the pay range for the class when the
needs of the service make such action necessary; provided that any exception is
based on the outstanding and unusual character of the employee's experience and
ability over and above the qualification requirements specified for the class
or that a critical shortage of applicants exists. In the latter case any
incumbents receiving a lower rate shall have their rates increased to the rate
established for entrance of new employees.
      (2)   Starting rate on return to duty. When an employee returns to duty
in the same class of position after a separation from the City service of not
more than one year, which separation was not due to discreditable
circumstances, such employee shall receive the rate in the pay range at the
step corresponding to the step of the rate received at the time of separation
and shall subsequently serve there for at least such period as is normally
required for advancement to the next higher rate.
      (3)   Starting rate on return from military service. Any employee who
leaves or has left the City service to enter the active service of the armed
forces of the United States and who subsequently is reinstated to a position
previously held by him shall be entitled to receive the rate of compensation at
the step to which he would have been entitled had his service with the City not
been interrupted by service in the armed forces.
      (4)   Starting rate in new position. Whenever an employee is assigned to
duty in a position not previously held by him and such change is not in the
nature of a promotion, he shall receive the entrance rate in the range
established for such new position or such other rate within the applicable
range as he may be entitled to by reason of crediting him in his new position
with prior service. Only if the character and nature of the duties of the
position to which the employee was assigned are similar to those of the new
position and the service in the former position provided experience valuable to
the performance of the new position can he be credited with prior service.
      (5)   Rate of pay on promotion. In any class where an employee is
promoted to a class with a higher base maximum rate, the entrance rate shall be
at the lowest step in the higher range that shall provide an increase of about
ten percent (10%) over the rate received immediately prior to such promotion;
provided that in cases where the maximum rate of the position to which promoted
is only five percent (5%) above the maximum rate of the former position, the
increase on promotion shall be about five percent (5%). Advancement to the
maximum rates subsequent to promotion shall be on the same basis as described
in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Salary Advancement Within Range. Increases within appropriate ranges
shall be based on merit and shall be from one step to the next higher step with
approval of the City Manager.
 
   (c)   Requirements As To Continuity of Service. Service requirements for
advancement within pay ranges and for other purposes as specified in this
chapter means continuous service, which means employment in the City service

pay of ten or less days shall not interrupt continuous service nor be deducted
therefrom. Absence on leave without pay in excess of ten days, except for
extended service with the armed forces of the United States or the Peace Corps,
shall be deducted in computing total service but shall not serve to interrupt

service.

authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any employer, or of any
taxpayer or person subject to the tax, for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax

the City.

of the tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
Such assessment shall be collected in accordance with the Rules and
Regulations.

(Ord. 2004-26. Approved by voters 5-25-04.)
189.11 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and all monies withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this Chapter and remaining unpaid after
they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one percent a month (12% a
year).
   (b)   Penalties on Unpaid Tax; Penalties on Failure to File Return. In
addition to interest as provided in Section
189.11(a) penalties are hereby imposed and shall be assessed as follow:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due: ten percent (10%) of unpaid tax, but
not less than fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (2)   For failure to make and file any return as required by Sections
189.05 and/or
189.06 fifty dollars ($50.00).
   (c)    Exceptions. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith
and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator. In
the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed on any
additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit, providing an amended
return is filed and the additional tax is paid within 3 months after final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (d)   On the recommendation of the City Auditor, the Board of Review may
abate penalty or interest or both, or on an appeal from the refusal of the City
Auditor to recommend abatement of penalty and interest, the Board may
nevertheless abate penalty or interest or both.
   (e)    Any person required to withhold the tax who knowingly fails to
withhold the tax or pay over the tax, or knowingly attempts in any manner to
evade or defeat the tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other
penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of
the tax evaded, not withheld, or not paid over. No other penalty under this
section shall be applied to any offense to which this penalty is applied.
(Ord. 2004-26. Approved by voters 5-25-04.)
 
189.12 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and administered by this chapter shall be
collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as
other debts of like amount are recoverable.
   (b)   When a final return is filed as prescribed in Section
189.05 hereof and a deficiency is determined to be due to the City, civil
action to collect the same shall not be commenced after three (3) years from
the due date of said return, and when a taxpayer fails to file a return, or
files a false or fraudulent return, action to collect tax due to the City shall
not be commenced after six (6) years from the due date of said return or the
date the false or fraudulent return was filed.
   (c)   Those officers or employees having control or supervision of, or
charged with, the responsibility of filing the return and making payments for a
corporation or association shall be personally liable for failure to file the
return or pay the taxes and penalties and interest due as required. The
dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any employer does not discharge
the officers' or employees' liability for a prior failure of such business to
file a return or pay the taxes due. (Ord. 2004-26. Approved by voters 5-25-04.)
   (d)    All unpaid tax accounts referred by the City Auditor or Income Tax
Administrator to an attorney, law firm, or collection agency shall be assessed
a collection fee on the entire balance due equal to the contingency collection
percentage charged by such attorney, law firm or collection agency as set forth
in a collection contract or written commitment letter with the City of
Ashtabula. The "entire balance due" prior the assessment of such collection fee
shall be deemed to be the sum of the principal balance due plus all penalties,
interest and permissible charges or fees assessed at or prior to the date of
referral. The collection fee shall be assessed as to all payments made by the
taxpayer whether or not the account is paid in full with a single payment or
over time with more than one payment. The assessment of the collection fee
shall be made by the attorney, law firm or collection agency after the referral
of the unpaid account. Additionally, court costs shall be added to the balance
due as they are incurred but shall not be assessed a collection fee. (Ord.
2010-152. Passed 10-18-10.)
189.13 REFUNDS AND EXTENSION REQUESTS.
   (a)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for a
refund is made. Claims for refund of municipal income taxes must be brought
within three (3) years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever
is later. However, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld
from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which there were deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (b)   Should it appear that any taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter or
should it be found that the tax paid or withheld was done so in error, a refund
of the amount so over paid shall be made, provided that a timely claim for
refund has been filed by the taxpayer.
   (c)   For tax years prior to 2004, the Administrator or an authorized agent
may extend the time for filing of the annual return of the taxpayer for a
period equivalent to any extension granted by the Internal Revenue Service for
the filing of the federal income tax return for the applicable tax year
provided such request for extension is filed not later than the annual return
date for the applicable tax year. For taxable year 2004 the extended due date
shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of
the federal income tax return has been extended. For taxable years subsequent
to 2004 the extended due date shall be the last day of the month to which the
due date of the federal income tax return has been extended. The Administrator
may deny the extension if the taxpayer's income tax account with the City is
delinquent in any way.
   (d)   A copy of the Federal extension request must be filed with the City by
the original due date of the City income tax return. The Administrator may
require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due. No penalty shall be
assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.
   (e)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that should have
been deposited with the City, but was deposited with another municipality,
shall be subject to recovery by the City. The City will allow a non- refundable
credit for any amount owed the City that is in excess of the amount to be
refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other
municipality is the same or higher than the City's tax rate. If the City's tax
rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the
rates is also subject to collection by the City.

shall be six (6) years from the date the return was due or the date the false
or fraudulent return was filed.
   (d)   The failure of any employer or taxpayer or person to receive or
procure a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from
making any infonnation return or declaration, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
191.091  of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
191.051  of this Chapter.
         (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
191.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
191.051  of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of

remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.

deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award

the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

returns required under this section.

INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)    "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)    "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net

         (ii)    "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
191.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
191.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be attributed to the site
of a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be attributed to the site of the municipal corporation in which the sale
originated. For the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in
a municipal corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets any of the following criteria:

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the

      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
191.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
191.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
191.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
191.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax

         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is

estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

wages, commissions, or other compensation to another municipality shall be
entitled to receive a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the

plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.

"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation

"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in

allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
191.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
191.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
191.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)    Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    The Municipality shall not deny spouses the ability to file a joint
return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)    A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
191.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
191.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
191.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is one dollar or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
191.051  of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.051  of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
191.052  of this chapter.
      (2)    A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing the municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown
to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by the Municipality, taxpayers,
or other persons does not affect the legal rights of the Municipality or
taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a party
to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a municipal
income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of the Municipality to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of the municipal income tax return. The extended
due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the
tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)    Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
191.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
191.19  of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
191.096  of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
191.10  of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

      (4)    With respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns,
the Municipality shall impose a monthly penalty of twenty-five dollars for each
failure to timely file each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon
for each month, or any fraction thereof, during which the return remains
unfiled regardless of the liability shown thereon. The penalty shall not exceed
a total of one hundred fifty dollars in assessed penalty for each failure to
timely file a return.
   (D)    With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not impose, seek to collect, or
collect any penalty, amount of interest, charges or additional fees not
described in this section.
   (E)    With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the Municipality shall not refund or credit any penalty,
amount of interest, charges, or additional fees that were properly imposed or
collected before January 1, 2016.
   (F)    The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole
discretion, abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this
section when the Tax Administrator deems such abatement or partial abatement to
be appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly
documented and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of
such abatement or partial abatement.
   (G)    The Municipality may impose on the taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, or any other payer the Municipality's post-judgment collection
costs and fees, including attorney's fees.

191.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
191.03 (3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator may not impose or collect
penalties and interest arising from the audit.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
191.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   Except as limited by the Municipal Charter or by lawful ordinance, the Tax

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this chapter;
   (E)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

      (Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim if there is a reasonable dispute as to the
amount taxes, interest or penalties due; or if there is a substantial
likelihood that the compromise will net the Municipality a greater sum than may
be expected to be received through continued collection efforts or litigation;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)    The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.
   The taxpayer's failure to provide the necessary and required information by
the Tax Administrator shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time
agreement.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
191.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section 191.10 of this
Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99  of this Chapter for a violation of Section
191.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts
or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
191.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)    The City Council of the City of Ashtabula shall maintain a
local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The three
members of the Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the City, but the
appointing authority may consider membership from individuals who are not
domiciled within the City. Two members shall be appointed by the City Council,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the City at
any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date
of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the City Manager. This member
may be an employee of the City, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
City Council shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that
a member may serve should the member be reappointed by the City Council. The
board member appointed by the City Manager shall serve at the discretion of the
City Manager.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the City Council
may be removed by the City Council as set forth in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the
Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the City Council or
City Manager that appointed the member shall appoint another individual to
temporarily serve on the board in the member's place. This appointment shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Board of Tax Review shall receive compensation,
fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of the Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to or
serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the hearing
unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs, and
shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Board of Tax
Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as needed by the
Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records available for
inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Board of Tax Review may remove such
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before the Board of
Tax Review are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-143. Passed 11-16-15.)
191.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
191.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after

193.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this section:
   (a)    "Income tax revenue" means the total amount withheld under Section
189.06  of the Codified Ordinances by the taxpayer during the taxable year, or
during the calendar year that includes the tax period, from the compensation of
each employee employed in the project. "Income tax revenue" excludes amounts
withheld before the day the taxpayer becomes eligible for the grant.
   (b)    "Baseline income tax revenue" means income tax revenue except that
the applicable withholding period is the twelve months immediately preceding
the date the taxpayer's application is filed with the City Manager, multiplied
by the sum of one plus an annual pay increase factor to be determined by the
City Manager, which may in his discretion be zero but which shall not exceed
0.05 per year (yielding a maximum total annual pay increase multiplier of
1.05). If the taxpayer becomes eligible for the grant after the first day of
the taxpayer's taxable year or after the first day of the calendar year that
includes the tax period, the taxpayer's baseline income tax revenue for the
first such taxable or calendar year of grant eligibility shall be reduced in
proportion to the number of days during the taxable or calendar year for which
the taxpayer was not eligible for the grant. For subsequent taxable or calendar
years, "baseline income tax revenue" equals the unreduced baseline income tax
revenue for the preceding taxable or calendar year multiplied by the sum of one
plus the pay increase factor.
   (c)    "Excess income tax revenue" means income tax revenue minus baseline
income tax revenue.
   (d)    "New job" means an employment position created within the grant
recipient's last full tax year prior to the date of application for a grant
under this Chapter, or to be created not later than the end of the second full
tax year following the date of such application. A position is deemed to be a
new job if it was subject to a layoff more than 6 months but less than 24
months prior to the date of application and is to be filled under the terms of
the project.
   (e)    "Project" means an expansion of an existing business enterprise, a
relocation of a business enterprise, the opening of an additional location of a
business enterprise or the creation of a business enterprise, which pays wages
that are subject to the tax imposed in Chapter
189  of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Ashtabula.
      (Ord. 2010-129. Passed 9-7-10.)
193.02 GRANTS FOR JOBS CREATION.

in the City of Ashtabula. Such a grant may take the form of a refundable credit
allowed against the tax imposed by Chapter
189  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (a)    The grant shall only be claimed for the taxable years or tax periods
specified in the grant recipient 's agreement with the City Manager under
Section
193.03 .
   (b)   The amount of the grant available for a taxable year or for a calendar
year that includes a tax period equals the excess income tax revenue for that
year multiplied by the percentage specified in the agreement.
      (Ord. 2010-129. Passed 9-7-10.)
193.03 APPLICATION; TERMS OF AGREEMENT.
   A taxpayer or potential taxpayer who proposes a project to create new jobs

this section if the City Manager determines that all of the following exist:

   (b)   The taxpayer's project is economically sound and will benefit the
people of the City and State by increasing opportunities for employment and
strengthening the economy;
   (c)   Receiving the grant is a major factor in the taxpayer's decision to go
forward with the project.
   (d)   An agreement under this section, to be negotiated between the taxpayer
and the City Manager, which shall include all of the following:
      (1)   A detailed description of the project that is the subject of the
agreement;
      (2)   The agreed term of the grant, which shall be based upon the
taxpayer's estimate of the average annual payroll attributable to new jobs
created during the first three (3) years of the project, which shall be within
the following ranges:
         Annual payroll under $100,000 - 3 years
         Annual payroll at least $100,000 but less than $500,000- up to 5 years

thereto in the case of salaried workers.
      (6)   A requirement that the taxpayer annually shall report tax
withholding, investment, and other information the Manager reasonably requires
to ensure compliance with this Chapter;

income in that year;
      (8)   A requirement that the taxpayer pay an annual monitoring fee of
1.00% of the amount of the grant for the prior year, or $50.00, whichever is

193.04 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)    If a grant recipient fails to meet or comply with any condition or
requirement set forth in the grant agreement, the City Manager may amend the
agreement to reduce the percentage or term of the grant. The reduction of the
percentage or term may take effect in the current taxable or calendar year. The
agreement shall provide at a minimum that the amount of the annual grant be
reduced by 25% for each year in which the grant recipient does not achieve at
least 90% of the grant recipient's projected annual payroll, above; and by 50%
for each year the grant recipient does not achieve at least 75% of the grant
recipient's projected annual payroll.

noncompliance. After receiving such a notice, and after giving the grant
recipient an opportunity to explain the noncompliance, the City Council may
require the grant recipient to refund to the City of Ashtabula a portion of the
grant in accordance with the following:

location for a period less than or equal to the term of the grant, an amount
not exceeding one hundred per cent of the sum of any grants allowed and
received under this section;

location for a period longer than the term of the grant, but less than the
greater of seven years or the term of the grant plus three years, an amount not
exceeding seventy-five per cent of the sum of any grants allowed and received
under this section.
   (c)    In determining the portion of the grant to be refunded to this City,
the City Council shall consider the effect of market conditions on the grant
recipient's project and whether the grant recipient continues to maintain other
operations in this State. After making the determination, the City Council
shall certify the amount to be refunded to the City Auditor for collection as

195.01 FINDINGS.
    The area designated as the Ashtabula Community Reinvestment Area
(hereinafter “Ashtabula CRA”) constitutes an area in which housing facilities
or structures of historical significance are located, and in which new
construction or repair of existing facilities has been discouraged.
(Ord. 2012-11. Passed 1-17-12.)
195.02 ESTABLISHMENT AND DESCRIPTION.
   Pursuant to ORC Section 3735.66, the Ashtabula CRA is hereby established in
the following described area and encompasses the entire corporate limits of the
City of Ashtabula:
   (a)   The Ashtabula CRA is approximately depicted as the cross hatched area
on the map attached to Ordinance No. 2008-32, marked Exhibit “B”, and by this
reference incorporated herein.
   (b)    Only residential, commercial and/or industrial properties consistent
with the applicable zoning regulations within the designated Ashtabula CRA will
be eligible for exemptions under this Program.
      (Ord. 2012-11. Passed 1-17-12.)
195.03 ELIGIBILITY FOR EXEMPTION.
    All properties identified in Exhibit “A” attached to Ordinance No. 2008-32
as being within the Ashtabula CRA (consisting of all properties within the
corporation limits of the City of Ashtabula, Ohio as of April 21, 2008) are
eligible for exemption from taxation (the City may determine that all or any
combination of project types – residential, commercial and industrial are
eligible). This proposal is a public/private partnership intended to promote
and expand conforming uses in the designated area. As part of the project, the
City of Ashtabula intends to undertake supporting public improvements in the
designated area.
(Ord. 2012-11. Passed 1-17-12.)
195.04 APPLICATION PROCESS.
   The owner of real property located in the Ashtabula CRA eligible for
exemption from taxation may file an application with the Housing Officer
pursuant to ORC Section 3735.67.
   (a)    If any part of the new structure or remodeling that would be exempted
is of real property to be used for commercial or industrial purposes, Council
and the property owner shall enter into a written agreement pursuant to ORC
Section 3735.671 prior to commencement of construction or remodeling
(hereinafter “Agreement”). If the Agreement is subject to approval by the board
of education of the school district within the territory of which the property
is or will be located, the Agreement shall not be formally approved by Council
until the board of education approves the Agreement in the manner prescribed by
that section.
   (b)    The Housing Officer shall verify the construction of the new
structure or the cost of the remodeling and the facts asserted in the
application. The Housing Officer shall determine whether the construction or
the cost of the remodeling meets the requirements for an exemption. In cases
involving a structure of historical or architectural significance, the Housing
Officer shall not determine whether the remodeling meets the requirements for a
tax exemption unless the appropriateness of the remodeling has been certified,
in writing, by the society, association, agency, or legislative authority that
has designated the structure or by any organization or person authorized, in
writing, by such society, association, agency, or legislative authority to
certify the appropriateness of the remodeling.
   (c)    If the construction or remodeling meets the requirements for
exemption, the Housing Officer shall forward the application to the County
Auditor with a certification as to the division of the ORC Section under which
the exemption is granted, and the period and percentage of the exemption as
determined by the legislative authority pursuant to that division. If the
construction or remodeling involves residential property, the Housing Officer
shall comply with the applicable notice requirements prescribed under ORC
Section 5709.83, unless the Board has adopted a resolution under that section
waiving its right to receive such a notice. If the construction or remodeling
involves commercial or industrial property and the legislative authority is not
required to certify a copy of a resolution under ORC Section 3735.671, the
Housing Officer shall comply with the notice requirements prescribed under ORC
Section 5709.83, unless the Board has adopted a resolution under that section
waiving its right to receive such a notice.
      (Ord. 2012-11. Passed 1-17-12.)
195.05 EXEMPTION.
   (a)    The tax exemption shall first apply in the year the construction or
remodeling would first be taxable but for this section. In the case of
remodeling that qualifies for exemption, a percentage of the amount by which
the remodeling increased the structure’s assessed value shall be exempt from
real property taxation. In the case of construction of a structure that
qualifies for exemption, a percentage of the structure’s assessed value shall
be exempt from real property taxation. If the structure or remodeling is to be
used for commercial or industrial purposes, the percentage and period shall be
those set forth in the Agreement, which Agreement may include the following:
      (1)    Up to ten (10) years and up to seventy-five percent (75%) for

use), shall be treated as a commercial project in its entirety subject to the
term length and percentages as set forth in subsections (a)(1) and (2) hereof.
   (b)    If the structure or remodeling is to be used for residential
purposes, the percentage and period shall be one of the following:

of remodeling is at least $5,000.00, and with such exemption being up to one
hundred percent (100%) for each year.

dwelling unit containing more than two family units upon which the cost of
remodeling is at least $10,000.00, and with such exemption being up to one

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

travel is emitting a steady red light or a vehicle has exceeded the speed
limits set forth in Section
333.03 .
(Ord. 2010-61. Passed 6-7-10.)
317.02 ADOPTION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   The City of Ashtabula hereby adopts a Photo Traffic Enforcement System
for the purpose of using photographic, video or digital imaging equipment to
record visual images of vehicles entering intersections in violation of Section
313.01  of the Codified Ordinances, or operating a vehicle in excess of the
limits set forth in Section
333.03  of the Codified Ordinances and using said images as the basis for
issuing a Notice of Liability to the owners of such vehicles within 30 days of
the violation.
   (b)    The City Manager or his or her designee(s) in conjunction with the
Ashtabula Police Department shall be responsible for implementing the Photo
Traffic Enforcement System for traffic signal and speed enforcement. The City
Manager or his or her designee in conjunction with the Police Department are
hereby empowered to designate the intersections to be monitored by the Photo
Traffic Enforcement System, to issue Notices of Liability for persons who
commit violations at such intersections, and to take all other measures
necessary for the implementation of the system, including the power to
promulgate any rules and regulations deemed to be necessary for the enforcement
of this Chapter.
   (c)    The intersections selected for photo enforcement for traffic signal
violations under this Chapter must display a yellow traffic control signal for
a time that complies with the Ohio Department of Transportation's Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
   (d)    The locations chosen for photo enforcement under this Chapter for
speed limit violations must display a speed limit sign in compliance with the
Ohio Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
Section 2B.11 and Section 2B.15 and Ohio R.C. 4511.21.
(Ord. 2010-61. Passed 6-7-10.)
317.03 NOTICE OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   Prior to the activation of a Photo Traffic Enforcement System, the
City Manager or his or her designee shall erect a sign in a conspicuous
location that provides notice that a Photo Traffic Enforcement System is being
used to monitor traffic.
   (b)   For the first 30 days after the activation of a Photo Traffic
Enforcement System at a given location no Notices of Liability will be issued
based upon the images produced by the system. However, warnings may be issued
during this 30-day period.
   (c)   A Police Officer employed by the Ashtabula Police Department shall
examine the image recorded by the Photo Traffic Enforcement System to determine
whether a violation as defined in Section
317.01  has occurred. If the image recorded by the Photo Traffic Enforcement
System shows a violation, contains a date and time of the violation, and shows
the vehicle's license plate number as well as the state in which the license
was issued, the officer may use any lawful means to identify the vehicle's
owner.
   (d)   The fact that a person is registered as the owner of a vehicle with
the vehicle registration office of the state that issued the license plate
displayed on the vehicle shall be prima facie evidence that said person was
operating the vehicle at the time of a violation recorded by a Photo Traffic
Enforcement System.
   (e)   Within 30 days of the violation and upon identification of the
registered owner of the vehicle, the Chief of Police or his or her designee may
issue a Notice of Liability, charging the owner with a violation. The Notice of
Liability shall be sent by regular U.S. mail and must state the date on which
the Notice of Liability was issued, the date, time, and location of the
violation, the time in which an answer must be made by the vehicle owner, and
the manner in which the Notice of Liability may be appealed. In addition, a
copy of the image(s) that served as a basis for the violation must accompany
the Notice of Liability.
   (f)    A person who receives a Notice of Liability pursuant to this Section
shall be required to respond within 30 days of the date the Notice of Liability
was issued in one of the following methods:
      (1)    By paying the civil penalty as directed on the Notice of
Liability; or
      (2)    By submitting evidence of one of the exceptions to liability
listed in subsection (g) hereof; or
      (3)    By submitting to the address listed on the Notice of Liability, a
request for a hearing as set forth in Section
317.04 .
   (g)   Notwithstanding subsection (d) hereof, the owner of the vehicle shall
not be liable for a penalty under this section if the Chief of Police or his or
her designee determines that sufficient evidence of either of the following
conditions exist:
      (1)   At the time of the violation, the vehicle was in the custody of
someone other than its owner pursuant to a written lease or rental agreement
and the owner submits, to the address listed on the ticket, a copy of the lease
or rental agreement along with the name and address of the lessee or renter.
      (2)   At the time of the violation, the vehicle or the license plate
depicted in the image which served as the basis for the Notice of Liability was
stolen and the owner submits, to the address listed on the Notice of Liability,
a copy of the police report stating the vehicle or license plate had been
reported stolen at the time.
   (h)   Within 10 business days of receiving evidence from the vehicle owner
indicating that he or she was not operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the issuing Police Officer may issue a Notice of Liability to the
person whom the evidence indicates was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation.
   (i)   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to limit the liability of
an operator of a motor vehicle for any violation of the Ohio Revised Code or
the Ashtabula Traffic Code.
(Ord. 2010-61. Passed 6-7-10.)
317.04 APPEALS.
   (a)    A person who received a Notice of Liability pursuant to Section
317.03  may appeal the Notice of Liability by making a written request for a
hearing to the address listed on the Notice of Liability. Said request shall be
accompanied by a monetary deposit in an amount equal to the amount of the civil
penalty listed on the Notice of Liability.
   (b)   Within thirty days of the receipt of the request for a hearing, a
hearing shall be held before a Hearing Officer appointed by the City Manager.
The Hearing Officer shall determine whether the City has demonstrated by a
preponderance of the evidence that a violation occurred and that the person who
received the Notice of Liability is liable for the penalty set forth in Section
317.99 .
   (c)   A certified copy of the Notice of Liability alleging the violation,
along with a copy of the image that served as a basis for the Notice of
Liability, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, and
shall be admissible in a proceeding alleging a violation under this Chapter.
   (d) In considering whether the person is liable, the Hearing Officer may
consider any of the following as an affirmative defense of a violation:
      (1)    That the Notice of Liability was issued and sent by first class
mail more than 30 days after the date of the violation recorded by the Photo
Traffic Enforcement System.
      (2)    That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection or
had increased speed in order to yield the right of way to an emergency vehicle,
in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.45 or to a funeral procession, in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4511.451.
      (3)    That either the vehicle or the license plate depicted on the
image, which served as the basis for the Notice of Liability, was stolen before
the violation occurred and was not in possession of the owner at the time of
the violation. To qualify as an affirmative defense under this provision, the
owner must submit proof that a police report about the stolen vehicle or
license plate was filed prior to or within 48 hours after the violation.
       (4)    That this section is unenforceable because the Photo Traffic
Enforcement System was not operating properly, or the Photo Traffic Enforcement
System was not in a proper position, or that the image that served as the basis
for the Notice of Liability is not legible enough to show the letters and
numbers or the state that issued the license plate on the vehicle.
      (5)    That the driver of the vehicle entered the intersection as part of
a funeral procession or at the direction of a police officer.
      (6)    Substantial, credible evidence that the owner or person named in
the Notice of Liability was not operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation. The uncorroborated statement of the person named in the Notice of
Liability to the effect that he or she was not the operator at the time of the
alleged violation shall not be considered substantial credible evidence for
purposes of this Section. To satisfy the evidentiary burden under this
provision, the owner or person named in the Notice of Liability must also
provide the Hearing Officer with substantial, credible evidence of the identity
of the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation,
including, at a minimum, the operator's name and current address.
   (e)   The Hearing Officer shall issue a written decision within 10 days of
the hearing and mail the person named on the Notice of Liability and the Chief
of Police or his or her designee a copy of said decision. In addition, if the
Hearing Officer concludes that the testimony and/or exhibits presented at the
hearing shows by a preponderance of the evidence that someone other than the
person named in the Notice of Liability was operating the vehicle at the time
of the violation, the Hearing Officer shall forward to the Chief of Police or
his or her designee all evidence provided to him or her at the hearing as to
the operator's identity and order the return of the deposit provided in
accordance with Section
317.04  (a) to the person who appealed.
   (f)   Within 10 business days of receiving the evidence referred to in
subsection (e) of this section, the Police Department or its designee may issue
a "Notice of Liability" to the person whom the evidence indicates was operating
the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (g)   If the Hearing Officer determines that the City has demonstrated by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person named in the Notice of Liability
committed the violation, the Hearing Officer shall enter judgment against the
person and the monetary deposit filed in accordance with Section
317.04 (a) shall be forfeited to the City of Ashtabula as satisfaction of the
civil penalty set forth in Section
317.99 (a). Such judgment shall be entered into the records of the Ashtabula
Police Department.
(Ord. 2010-61. Passed 6-7-10.)
317.99 CIVIL PENALTY.
   (a) Unless the operator of a vehicle receives a traffic citation from a
police officer or law enforcement officer at the time and location the
violation occurs, a civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) shall be assessed against the vehicle owner for the commission of a
violation as defined in Section
317.01 .
   (b)   A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section
shall not be considered a traffic offense or a moving violation for the purpose
of assessing points under Ohio R.C. 4507.021 and shall not be reported to the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles of any state.
   (c)   The failure to respond to a "Notice of Liability" in accordance with
Section
317.03 (f) shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest liability for the
violation as provided by Section
317.04 .
   (d)   If the vehicle owner fails to respond to the Notice of Liability
within the period set forth in
317.03 (f), or the penalty provided in this Section remain unpaid for more than
90 days after the date on which the Notice of Liability was sent, the penalty
shall be collected together with interest thereon at the rate of ten percent
(10%) per annum from the date of violation, by civil suit or other appropriate
means of collection.

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or
except as permitted under subsection (a) (2) hereof.

distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made,
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for
traffic approaching from the opposite direction before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct or tunnel;
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection
or railroad grade crossing.
   (b)   This section does not apply to vehicles upon a one-way roadway, upon a

   (a)   Hazardous zones, commonly called "no passing zones," shall consist of
an auxiliary yellow line marked on the roadway pavement and placed parallel to
the normal center line or marked lane line. When the auxiliary yellow line
appears on the left side in the driver's lane of travel and to the right of the
normal center line or marked lane line, no driver shall drive across the
auxiliary yellow line to overtake and pass another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction. When auxiliary yellow lines appear on both sides of the normal
center line or marked lane line, drivers proceeding in either direction shall
not drive across such auxiliary yellow lines to overtake and pass another
vehicle proceeding in the same direction. No driver shall, at any other time,
drive across the yellow auxiliary line when it appears in the driver's lane of
travel, except to make a lawfully permitted left-hand turn under the rules
governing such movement. No passing signs may also be erected facing traffic to
indicate the beginning and end of each no passing zone.
   When appropriate signs or markings indicating hazardous or no passing zones
are in place and clearly visible, every operator of a vehicle shall obey the
directions of the signs or markings, notwithstanding the distance set out in

vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.
      (3)   There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the center
or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing provisions of
Section
331.05, considering the speed of the slower vehicle.

331.08 DRIVING IN MARKED LANES OR CONTINUOUS LINES OF TRAFFIC.
   (a)   Whenever any roadway has been divided into two or more clearly marked
lanes for traffic or wherever traffic is lawfully moving in two or more
substantially continuous lines in the same direction, the following rules
apply:
      (1)   A vehicle shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely
within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane
or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made
with safety.
      (2)   Upon a roadway which is divided into three lanes and provides for
two-way movement of traffic, a vehicle shall not be driven in the center lane
except when overtaking and passing another vehicle where the roadway is clearly
visible and such center lane is clear of traffic within a safe distance, or
when preparing for a left turn, or where such center lane is at the time
allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the direction the vehicle is
proceeding and is posted with signs to give notice of such allocation.
      (3)   Official signs may be erected directing specified traffic to use a
designated lane or designating those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a
particular direction regardless of the center of the roadway, or restricting

competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three

affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,

individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.

is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.

the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.

offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

drivers’
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. As used
in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two consecutive hours.
If the court determines that the offender is not conducive to treatment in a
drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to attend a drivers’
intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is to serve the jail
term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the court shall
sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six consecutive
days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of
not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the

      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender

offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that    could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

or former municipal ordinance, or to an existing or former division of any such
existing or former law or ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined
or specified, a substantially equivalent offense. (ORC 2901.04)
501.05 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
“The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from the
witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)    Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs, the court
imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor committed under the
Codified Ordinances, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender
to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized
under this section. If the court in its discretion imposes one or more
financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to
this section include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    Restitution. Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender's crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim's economic loss. If the court requires restitution, the court shall
order that the restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult
probation department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on
behalf of the victim. The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in
the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of
the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion,
it may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)    Fines. A fine in the following amounts:
         (a)    Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a minor misdemeanor

   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
180 days of the alleged violation with the Fair Housing Board a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the
person alleged to have committed the violation complained of and the
particulars thereof, and such other information as may be required by the
Board. The Board may also corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of
testing carried out by its staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary and/or the
Board shall make such investigation as they deem appropriate to ascertain facts
and issues. If the executive secretary and/or the Board shall determine that
there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, they shall
attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
the Board or any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree
thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purpose only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or determines that a complaint is not susceptible of
conciliation, he shall notify the Board immediately and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
ordinance has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file such statements with the Board prior to the hearing date as it
deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing shall be opened to the
public, except that the respondent may request in writing a private hearing;
the determination of such request shall be discretionary with the Board. The
hearing shall be held not less than fifteen days after service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued shall be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
   The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross
examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given
under oath or by affirmation. The executive secretary shall keep a full record
of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection by any
person, and upon request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board
shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such cost as
the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the City Solicitor in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the City Solicitor to
prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as shall effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board shall recertify the matter to the City Solicitor for
enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the City Solicitor for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City of Ashtabula before a court of competent
jurisdiction. In any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has
been a violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages
and, where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The Court
may also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 1990-110. Passed 4-30-90.)

   (b)   The Chief of Police or his designee, upon finding probable cause to
believe that two or more nuisance activities declared in this section have
occurred at or within 200 feet of any residential property and knowingly
engaged in by an owner, occupant or invitee of the owner or occupant of such
residential property shall cause a written warning letter to be served on the
owner of the property declaring that such property shall be declared a nuisance
property if a third nuisance activity occurs at or within 200 feet of the
property within a 12-month period. Exception: felony narcotics violations do
not require a warning letter but are automatically deemed a nuisance,
 
   (c)   The Chief of Police or his or her designee, upon finding that three or
more nuisance activities or two felony narcotics violation declared in this
section have occurred within any 12-month period at or within 200 feet of any
residential property, shall cause a written notice and order to be served on
the owner of the property declaring that such property is a nuisance property.
The notice and order shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated
costs to abate any future nuisance, and state that the owner may avoid being
charged the costs of abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance
activity as set forth in this section. The notice shall further state that if a
subsequent nuisance activity as declared in this Section occurs within 12
months of the dates of the first activity referenced in the Notice the City may
abate the nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property.
      (1)   The notice shall be served on the owner(s) that are listed on the
records of the Ashtabula County Auditor by delivering it personally to the
owner or leaving it at the owner's usual place of business or residence, or by
posting it in a conspicuous place on the real estate involved, or by mailing it
to the owner by regular and certified mail, or by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation within the City if it cannot be served in any
of the other ways above mentioned.
 
   (d)   If, within 12 months after the first of the two nuisances or the first
felony drug violation referred to in division (b) of this section has occurred,
a third nuisance or second felony drug activity as declared in this section
occurs, the City may abate the nuisance by responding to the activity using
administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement
shall be assessed on the nuisance property in the same manner as in Ohio R.C.
715.281, and the costs shall be calculated as set forth in division (e) of this
section. The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of
the City's intent to assess the costs of abatement against the owner's property
at least 30 days before such costs are certified to the County for assessment
against the property, and such notice shall contain a description of the
nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent to assess the
property, and the cost to abate. Notice shall be served as set forth above in
division (b) of this section.
 
   (e)   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief
of Police or his designee pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
30 days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds that the facts
presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief shall rescind
the notice. Otherwise, the Chief shall deny the request and refer the appeal
for hearing by the City Manager. Any such appeal shall not stay any actions by
the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In any such appeal, the
City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in
the notice being appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the
property as a nuisance property or of the intent of the City to assess the
property for abatement costs, whichever is applicable, is justified. A person
need not be convicted of any of the foregoing offenses in order for a finding
of public nuisance to be made, as long as substantial, credible evidence
supports such a finding; however, conviction of such a criminal offense shall
be conclusive proof of the conduct alleged to constitute the offense for all
purposes under this Section. The City shall be deemed to have failed to have
met this standard if the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence
that:
       (1)    He or she was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the notice; or
       (2)    He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has
promptly and vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9); or
       (3)    He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity;
and upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio R.C.
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
 
   (f)   Costs of abatement shall be assessed in an amount equal to 200% of the
hourly wages of the police officers, dog wardens and/or housing inspectors or
other code enforcement officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance
activity multiplied by the number of hours required to abate the nuisance.
 
   (g)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the City on a property, do not affect or limit
the City's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal

   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of

or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this subsection (c), “advanced practice registered
nurse” does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by subsection (c) of this section was made, or to any law

inflicted in a violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the

be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under subsection (e) of this section.

patient or client has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege
or advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground
for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under subsection (f)(1) of this section, and the information may
be admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.
   (g)   Subsections (a) and (d) of this section do not require disclosure of

a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.

      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to that member of the clergy in that member’s capacity as a
member of the clergy by a person seeking the aid or counsel of that member of
the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for persons with drug dependencies or persons
in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12. As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.

duties.

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado-masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the following
apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

761.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The City of Ashtabula, Ohio's Board of Health has determined that youth
addiction to tobacco products is a public health problem with grave health
consequences. Research indicates that approximately ninety-five percent (95%)
of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn twenty-one (21). Evidence
suggests that nicotine use during adolescence and young adulthood has long term
impacts on brain development and tobacco use remains the leading cause of
preventable death in the US. In recognition of the Surgeon General's conclusion
that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin, action is needed to curtail
the easy access to cigarettes and other tobacco products to under age youth.
Therefore, the purpose of this regulation is to implement a strict and
enforceable system to prevent the illegal sale of cigarettes and other tobacco
and vapor products to persons under twenty-one (21) years of age.

919.01 ACTION WITH OR WITHOUT PETITION.
   (a)    When, in the opinion of the City Council, there is good cause for
vacating or narrowing a street or alley, or any part thereof, and that such
vacation or narrowing will not be detrimental to the general interest, it may,
by ordinance and without petition, vacate or narrow such street or alley or any
part thereof. However, review by the Planning Commission and either public
notice or written consent by all adjoining owners as required in this Chapter
shall precede such action. The City Council may include in one ordinance the
change of name, vacation, or narrowing of more than one street, avenue, or
alley.
   (b)   The City Council, on petition by a person owning a lot in the City
praying that a street or alley in the immediate vicinity of such lot be vacated
or narrowed, or the name thereof changed, upon being satisfied that there is
good cause for such change of name, vacation, or narrowing, that it will not be
detrimental to the general interest, and that it should be made, may, by
ordinance, declare such street or alley vacated, narrowed, or the name thereof
changed. Said petition shall be in writing, signed by all petitioners, and
shall include all of the following:
      (1)   The names and addresses of all owners of real property abutting the
portion of the street or alley proposed to be renamed, vacated or narrowed;
      (2)   An acknowledgement that a survey by a registered surveyor,

alley to be renamed, vacated or narrowed, will be required before any ordinance
vacating or abandoning the street or alley becomes effective, and that such
survey must be obtained within 180 days of passage of the ordinance;
      (3)   A statement of the cause(s) or reason(s) for the proposed change of
name, vacation or narrowing.
         (Ord. 2020-135. Passed 12-21-20.)

Commission, if any, for consideration by City Council.

accordance with Section
919.01(a), a copy of the proposed ordinance vacating, narrowing or renaming the

alley, avenue, or part thereof shall be given as provided in this Chapter

properties abutting the part of the street or alley proposed to be vacated, in
which case such notice shall not be required.
   (b)   Except as provided in Paragraph (a) of this Section, no street or
alley shall be vacated, narrowed or renamed unless notice of the pendency and
prayer of the petition, or of the ordinance, under this Chapter is given by the
Clerk of Council by publishing the same in a newspaper of general circulation
in such City once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks preceding action on
such petition. Action by City Council thereon may take place three (3) days
after the date of the last publication, and shall in all events take place
within ninety (90) days after the completion of publication.
   (c)   The notice published by the Clerk of Council shall state the name or
names of the petitioner(s), identify the street or portion thereof to be
vacated, narrowed or renamed, and set forth the earliest date upon which
Council could take action as set forth in Paragraph (b) of this Section. The
notice shall state that a copy of the petition is on file with the office of
Planning and Community Development and may be examined during regular business
hours. In the event Council is proceeding without a petition, the notice shall
state that a copy of the ordinance is on file with the Clerk of Council. The
notice shall include the following statement: “Any person objecting to the
(vacation) (narrowing) (renaming) of the above public street may file written
objections with the Clerk of Council including any reasons for such objection.
Objections must be filed before the date after which it is indicated the City
Council may take action as set forth above.” (Ord. 2020-135. Passed 12-21-20.)

   (a)   The enactment of an ordinance by City Council vacating or narrowing a
street or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the proprietor
thereof, shall, to the extent to which it is vacated or narrowed, operate as a
revocation of the acceptance thereof by the City Council, but the right of way
and easement therein of any lot owner shall not be impaired by such order.
   (b)   The vacation of a street or alley shall operate as a conveyance of
title to the vacated portion to the abutting property owner or owners. If the
street or alley is vacated rather than narrowed, each abutting owner shall be
deemed to own the vacated portion from the former right-of-way line abutting
his or her property to the center of the former right-of-way, unless the
affected owners all consent in writing to a different division of the vacated
portion, in which event Council may include such agreed division in its
ordinance.

   (o)    Liability insurance:
      (1)   Required. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a permit
required by this section, under which an excavation, tunnel or the laying of
sewer or storm drain pipe in any public street, public place or public easement
is contemplated shall not be issued until the applicant has filed with the City
a policy of protective liability insurance in which the City has been named as
insured or coinsured with the permittee. The policy of insurance shall insure
the City and its officers and employees, while acting within the scope of their
duties, against all claims arising out of or in connection with the operations
of the permittee or any contractor or subcontractor of the permitee, pursuant
to the permit.
      (2)   Amounts. The policy of insurance shall provide coverage in
accordance with Chapter
905 .
      (3)   Coverage. The policy of the insurance shall provide coverage at
least as broad as that provided in the standard form approved by the National
Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, together with such endorsements as are
required to cover the risks involved.
      (4)   Deposits.
         A.   Required. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a permit
required by this section under which an excavation, tunnel or the laying of
sewer or storm drain pipe in any public street or public easement is
contemplated, will not be issued until the applicant has deposited with the
City a restoration deposit in accordance with Section
905.05. The deposit shall be held to insure the faithful performance of the
work and the payment of all charges required.
         B.   Surety bond in lieu of deposit. Whenever in this section a cash
deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500) or over is required, the
applicant may provide in lieu of the cash deposit, a good and sufficient bond
in the amount equal to the amount of the cash deposit, payable to the City, by
and executed by the applicant as the principal and by a reliable surety company
satisfactory to the City. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of all
charges required by Section
933.06 and the faithful and proper performance of work upon the same terms as
those required by the cash deposit in lieu of which the bond is executed. The
City is empowered to enforce collections under the bond for all sums due for
charges hereunder and for any and all damage accruing to the City by reasons of
faulty or defective work of the permittee.
 
   (p)    The Federal Government, the State, every county, city, municipal
corporation, school district established by law, and any political or
administrative subdivision of the State or Federal Government shall not be
required to make a deposit or to post a policy of protective liability
insurance as otherwise required by subsection (o) hereof.
 
   (q)    No person having obtained a permit from the City shall construct,
alter or repair any house connection sewer or any portion of any house
connection sewer, or make a connection to any public sewer or house connection
pursuant to any permit, at any place other than that designated thereon.
Neither shall the person fail, refuse or neglect to comply with any requirement
contained or referred to in this section. At all times, while the work under
any such permit is in progress, the original of the permit shall be kept at the
place of the work and shall, on demand, be exhibited to the City or to any of
its inspectors, agents or representatives or to any police officer.
 
   (r)    The construction of all house connection sewers, and all repairs to
house connection sewers, shall be as follows:
      (1)   All pipe shall be vitrified clay, cast iron, polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) or other material approved as to grade and quality by the City and have a
minimum internal diameter of eight inches.
      (2)   House connection sewers in easements over private property shall be
constructed of only clay pipe with flexible joints, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or
cast iron pipe and may have an internal diameter of four to six inches.
      (3)   Upon proper application to the City, the City Engineer or City
Manager's designee may permit the increase in the internal diameter of house
connection sewers to not more than two inches less than the internal diameter
of the public sewer to which it is connected, if such increased diameter is in
accordance with good engineering practice.
      (4)   The quality of the pipe, the type of joint and other materials
used, the manner of constructing house connection sewers, the backfilling of
the trench, except where specifically provided for herein, or by the City
Engineer or City Manager's designee, shall be the same as is required by the
latest specifications and standard plans for the construction of sanitary
sewers in the City.
 
   (s)    Whenever, in connection with the construction or repair of a sewer
connection, a hazardous excavation shall be made or an excavation is to be made
by tunneling under the surface of a street or alley, the City may adopt such
regulations and require such special instructions as it may deem necessary. The
cost of such special inspection shall be estimated by the City and paid as
outlined in subsection (k) hereof and the City Health District Plumbing Code.
 
   (t)    All house connection sewers unless otherwise authorized by the City
shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two percent (2%) with a depth
measured to the invert at the property line of not less than four feet below
the top of the existing curb, or proposed curb at the nearest point. If there
is no existing or proposed curb, then the house connection sewers shall be laid
on a uniform grade of not less than two percent (2%) with depth measured to the
invert not less than four feet below the surface of the roadway, sidewalk or
alley at the property line, unless a greater depth is required to serve such
property.
 
   (u)    Where a building is on or immediately adjacent to a property line to
which a sewer connection shall be constructed, and an existing house sewer from
the building ends at the property line at a depth of less than the depth
required in this section for the upper end of the house connection sewer to be
constructed to such property line or where an earth bank over four feet in
height exists adjacent to the curb line or property line; the City shall adopt
regulations for the construction of that portion of the house connection sewer
between the curb line and property line, if in a street and between the main
sewer and the property line, if an alley, walk or other public place improved
or to be improved without a curb, which shall meet such conditions better than
the method of construction herein prescribed. Where a main sewer exceeds
fourteen feet in depth, the manner of constructing a house connection sewer
from such a sewer shall be regulated by the City.
 
   (v)    Persons making an excavation in any street or sidewalk for any of the
purposes mentioned in this chapter shall maintain free access to all fire
hydrants and water gates. All materials excavated shall be laid compactly along
the side of the trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little
inconvenience as possible to public travel. If any excavation is made across
any street or alley, at least one safe crossing shall be maintained at all
times for vehicles and pedestrians. Where required to keep traffic lanes and
sidewalk passageways clear, tight board fences shall be used to hold excavated
material. All gutters shall be maintained free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the face of
the curb at the gutter line. Until the excavation is entirely refilled,
barriers necessary to prevent accidents shall be maintained about the
excavation during the daytime and lights and barriers shall be maintained about
the excavation from sunset of each day until sunrise of the next morning. Until
the excavation is entirely refilled, a sign or barrier shall be maintained
adjacent to the excavation in letters at least three inches high, bearing the
name of the person making such excavation.
 
   (w)    Any excavation for the purpose of making a house connection to a
sewer shall be refilled in the manner required by this chapter within three
days after inspection of the pipe by the City, or within three days after the
date of the completion of the excavation if no work is done therein. Nothing in
this chapter shall be construed to allow a longer period of time therefor. The
top surface of backfill shall conform closely enough to the level of the
adjoining street or sidewalk surface, and shall be compacted so that it is hard
enough and smooth enough, to be safe for pedestrian travel over it as well as
for vehicular traffic to pass safely over it at a legal rate of speed. The
permittee shall maintain the surface of the backfill in a condition for safe
pedestrian and vehicular traffic until the surface has been repaired by the
City. The permittee shall be responsible for all accidents which may occur due
to pedestrians traveling over or upon the site of the excavation as well as
vehicles crossing the site at a legal rate of speed, until the surface has been
so repaired. If it is impracticable to maintain the surface of the backfill in
safe condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic then the permittee
shall maintain barriers and red lights around it until the sidewalk and street
pavements have been repaired.
 
   (x)    Any street surface adjacent to the sewer repair site excavated or
damaged shall be replaced by the City, and the cost thereof shall be recovered
by the City in accordance with the provisions of subsection (j) hereof.
 
   (y)    In all cases where the public records of a public sewer, or house
connection sewer, do not correctly represent the existing conditions of or
conditions surrounding the sewer, or where, in the opinion of the City, the
physical conditions are such that strict compliance with the provisions of this
section is unnecessary or unreasonable, the City is granted the power to make
modifications for individual cases, and determine the procedure to be followed,
and its decision shall be final.
 
   (z)    No person shall connect a four-inch house sewer to a six-inch house
connection sewer without installing a six inch by four inch increaser tee on
the end of the six inch house connection sewer, or a six inch by four inch
increaser followed by a four inch by four inch by four inch tee branch.
 
   (aa)    Permit fees shall be exempted under the following conditions:
      (1)   Waiver of fees for war purposes only. Whenever any officer, agency
or instrumentality of the United State, engaged in the performance of duties
directly related to the prosecution of the war in which the United States may
be engaged, applies to the City for a permit for any of the purposes mentioned
in this chapter, the City shall waive the payment of any permit or inspection
fees, deposits or special charges otherwise required by this section if the
City finds that the proposed installation is designed and intended to be used
to serve premises or facilities owned or operated by the federal government and
used principally for purposes directly related to the prosecution of the wars.
      (2)   Effect of grant.  The grant of permission to make any installation,
extended under this section, shall not be construed to confer any permanent or
vested right to the use of the streets or public property of the City, or to
maintain, for a period of more than six months after the termination of the
war, any installation made hereunder or any connection with a public sewer,
except with the consent of Council. Such consent may be withdrawn, or extended,
upon such terms as Council may then or at any time thereafter impose. The use,
directly or indirectly, of any installation made pursuant to this section by
anyone other than the applicant and those persons, firms or corporations which
have equitably participated with the federal government in the cost of the
sewer construction or installation, as determined by the City from certified
copies of existing contracts between the parties and the federal government,
shall be subject to such terms and conditions as Council may at any time
impose.
      (3)   Conveyance of title to right-of-way for public sewers. In the event
that the federal government and the other parties in interest, as mentioned in
subsection (aa) (2) hereof shall offer to convey all their respective right,
title and interest to any sewer constructed hereunder, including all necessary
rights-of-way for sewer purposes, without cost to the City, and if the City
finds that the sewer may properly be used as a public sewer, to the substantial
advantage of the City, then the City is authorized to accept the sewer as a
public sewer at such time as Council has accepted all necessary easements
therefor and the parties in interest shall be entitled to continue to use the
sewer facilities without the payment to the City of any permit or other special
fees or charges except those required by subsection (q) hereof.
 
   (bb)    No permit shall be granted hereunder unless plans and specifications
of the proposed installation have been submitted to and approved by the City of
Ashtabula.
 
   (cc)    All funds received by payment for permits from all persons,
corporations, partnerships or other bodies accomplishing a sewer connection
tap-in shall be collected by the City Manager or his duly authorized agent and
such funds shall be deposited in Account No. 180.103 Sewer Plant (fees), under
such rules and regulations as the City Auditor and City Treasurer may deem
appropriate according to law.
(Ord. 2016-50. Passed 3-21-2016.)
933.08 USE OF SEWERS.
   (a)    No person, firm or corporation shall discharge or cause to be

(Ord. 2016-50. Passed 3-21-2016.)
933.09 LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS ON PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF
NONDOMESTIC WASTEWATE DISCHARGES.
   (a)   General Discharge Prohibitions.
      (1)   No discharger shall contribute or cause to be discharged, directly
or indirectly, any of the following described discharges into the wastewater
disposal system or otherwise to the facilities of the City:
         A.   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction to cause
fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the operation of the
sewer system or wastewater treatment facilities. But in no case, wastestreams
with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit or sixty
degrees Centigrade using the method specified in 40 CFR 261.21;

interference or Pass Through;
         O.   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Superintendent in accordance with Section
933.17 of this ordinance.
      (2)   Unacceptable discharges shall include those which have been
determined by the Superintendent to:
         A.   Contain materials or discharges which would constitute a hazard
to life and limb of personnel engaged in inspection, maintenance and operation
of the system;
         B.   Contain any toxic substance unless specifically allowed in an
industrial pretreatment permit;
         C.   Contain materials or discharges which are in any way deleterious

   (b)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Categorical Pretreatment Standards
shall be met by all dischargers of the regulated industrial categories. All
Categorical Pretreatment Standards presently in effect or hereafter added or
amended and found in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby
adopted by reference by the City as part of this Ordinance.
 
   (c)   Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to amend this Ordinance
to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the
City's facilities where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set
forth in Section
933.14  or to assure compliance by the City with applicable laws and
regulations.
 
   (d)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this Ordinance.
 
   (e)   Supplementary Limitation.
      (1)   No person shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into
the system wastes which contain any pollutants unless the person is issued a
wastewater discharge permit which allows the discharge of such pollutants.
Specific limitations are listed in individual wastewater discharge permits. In
the absence of such specific wastewater discharge permit conditions, no person
shall discharge any pollutants in concentrations that exceed domestic
background concentrations.
 
   (f)   Mass Limitations. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on
dischargers which are suspected of using dilution to meet the pretreatment
standards or requirements of this Ordinance or in other cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate by the Superintendent.
      (1)   Per 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(5), when the limits in a categorical
Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations,
an Industrial User may request that the Control Authority convert the limits to
equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to
mass limits is within the discretion of the Control Authority. The Control
Authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User
meets all the following conditions in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) through (c)(5)(i)
(E) of this section.
      (2)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the Industrial User
must:
         A.   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its control mechanism;
         B.   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         C.   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual
average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous
effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average
production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and long-term average
production rate must be representative of current operating conditions;
         D.   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels
that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to
control the Discharge; and
         E.   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request
for equivalent mass limits.
 
   (g)   Local Limits.
      (1)   Local limits are allowable concentrations established for
pollutants present in the collection system having a reasonable potential to
cause NPDES permit violations, treatment system upsets, pass through,
interference, sludge contamination, threats to workers health and safety, or
other problems within the collection system or at any treatment facility. Said
pollutants include, but are not necessarily limited to, arsenic, cadmium,
carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5), chromium (total and dissolved
hexavalent), chlorine, copper, free cyanide, E-coli, lead, molybdenum, nickel,
oil and grease, phosphorus, silver, selenium, suspended solids, zinc and
mercury. The local limits for the City are defined in the most recent Technical
Justification of Local Industrial Wastewater Discharge Limitations, a summary
of which shall be available for inspection during regular business hours in the
offices of the City of Ashtabula Division of Water Pollution Control.
      (2)   No person shall discharge or cause or allow to be discharged into
the system wastes which contain any pollutant in any concentration in excess of
the local limits as defined above.

additional operational and maintenance activities. The compliance schedule
shall be as required in subsection (m) hereof;
      (10)   Disclosure of each product by type, amount, process or processes
and rate of production; and
      (11)   Disclosure of the type and amount of all materials utilized
(average and maximum per day).
   The Superintendent shall evaluate the complete baseline report and data
furnished by the discharger and may require additional information. Within a
reasonable time after full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the
Superintendent shall notify the discharger of his acceptance thereof. Any
violation of this schedule shall be a violation of this Ordinance and subject
to enforcement contained in Section
933.12.
 
   (d)   Compliance Date Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set
forth in this Ordinance or ninety days following commencement of the
introduction of wastewater into the system by a new discharger, any discharger
subject to this Ordinance shall submit to the Superintendent a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.
 
   (e)   Periodic Compliance Reports. Any industrial user subject to a
pretreatment standard shall submit to the City during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently by the Superintendent, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances
in the effluent which is required by the wastewater discharge permit. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement provided, however, where cost of
feasibility conditions justify, the Superintendent may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The
Superintendent, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or the extenuating factors may
authorize the submission of such reports on months other than those specified
above. Where required by the wastewater discharge permit, the report shall
include production and operating data. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard
requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the User must submit documentation required by the
Superintendent or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the User. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and,
if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to being the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements.
 
   (f)   Monitoring and Analysis. Any sampling or analysis done as part of the
reports required in this section shall be performed as follows:
      (1)   The sampling and analysis done as part of the reports in subsection
(b) hereof, shall consist of a minimum of four grab samples, with the test
result averaged, shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants twenty-four hour
composite samples shall be obtained through flow proportional composite
sampling techniques where feasible with the exception of Hexavalent Chromium,
which shall be analyzed as a grab sample. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 C.F.R. 136 and appropriate USEPA
guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four hour period may
be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for Hexavalent Chromium,
Cyanide, Total Phenols and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or the field; for Volatile Organics and Oil and Grease the samples
may be composited in the laboratory OAC 3745-3-06-(H)(7). The Superintendent
may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that
demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases,
samplings may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user
demonstrates to the Superintendent's satisfaction that this shall provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
      (2)   Any sampling or analysis done as part of the reports required by
subsection (d) or (e) hereof shall consist of a minimum of one representative
sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this
section. The Superintendent may require additional samples.
      (3)   If sampling performed by the industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the Superintendent within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within
thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. If a violation occurs where
the Control Authority has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
industrial user, the Control Authority shall perform the repeat sampling and
analysis unless it notifies the industrial user of the violation and requires
the IU to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. If the Control Authority
does the sampling, the shall perform the repeat sampling within 30 days of
violation unless notifying the IU and requiring the IU to perform the repeat
sampling and analysis.
      (4)   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow, the type of sample, and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where required by the
Superintendent. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as
prescribed in the wastewater discharge permit. All analysis shall be performed
in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part
136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures
for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the Superintendent.
      (5)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in
subsections (b), (d) or (e) hereof monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the City, using the procedures prescribed in subsection (f) hereof,
the result of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
      (6)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
 
   (g)   Monitoring Waivers.
      (1)   The City may authorize, at its discretion, an industrial user
subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, except for Centralized Waste
Treatment facilities regulated by and defined in 40 C.F.R. 437, to forego
sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard.
Monitoring waivers do not apply to pollutants where there are certification
processes and requirements established by the control authority or by
categorical pretreatment standards (e.g. TOMP/certification alternative to
total toxic organics monitoring) unless allowed for by the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard.
      (2)   If a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be
present based on changes that occur in the IU's operations, the user shall be
required to immediately notify the control authority in writing and start
monitoring that pollutant at the frequency specified in the POTW's pretreatment
program.
      (3)   The monitoring waiver applies only to IU self-monitoring and
monitoring performed by the City to satisfy IU self-monitoring requirements.
      (4)   In making its request for a pollutant monitoring waiver, the
industrial user must demonstrate through sampling and other technical factors
that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and
without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user.
In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the industrial user
must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process
wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative wastewater from all processes. Non-detectable sample results may
only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the USEPA
approved analytical method from 40 C.F.R. 136 with the lowest method detection
limit for that pollutant was used.
      (5)   Waivers are valid only for the duration of the effective period of
the IU's control mechanism but in no case longer than five years. The IU must
submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each
subsequent control mechanism.
      (6)   The request for a monitoring waiver shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user in accordance with paragraph
(F) of rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code, and it must include the
certification statement in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
      (7)   The City will include any monitoring waiver as a condition in the
industrial user's discharge permit. The supporting reason(s) for a monitoring
waiver and the information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver
shall be maintained in the industrial user's file by the City for three years
after expiration of the waiver.
   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the IU's control
mechanism by the City, the IU shall certify on each self-monitoring report with
the following statement:
   "Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for
managing compliance with the pretreatment standards under 40 C.F.R. [specify
applicable national pretreatment standard part or parts], I certify that, to
the best of my knowledge and belief, there has been no increase in the level of
[list pollutant or pollutants] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the
facility since submittal of the last periodic report under paragraph (E) of
rule 3745-3-06 of the Administrative Code."
 
   (h)   Signatory Requirements. Any reports required in subsections (b), (d)
or (e) hereof shall include the certification statement as follows:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
 
   Furthermore, all reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user. If an authorization as defined in Section
933.02 is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization
satisfying the requirements in Section
933.02 shall be submitted to the Superintendent of Wastewater Treatment prior
to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
 
   (i)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   All sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or
structure with an opening of no less than twenty-four inches diameter and an
internal diameter of no less than thirty-six inches containing flow measuring,
recording and sampling equipment as required by the Superintendent to assure
compliance with this Ordinance. The Superintendent may require the owner of any
premises which discharges to the system to install a suitable inspection
chamber together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
discharge, or potential discharge. Such chambers, when required, shall be
constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed
within thirty days following approval and written notification by the
Superintendent. Any installations of sampling facilities, flow monitoring
facilities, instruments, devices etc. required by the POTW shall be paid for by
the industrial user.
      (2)   If the sampling and monitoring facilities are not constructed
within thirty days of official notification given to the property owner by the
Superintendent, the Superintendent shall utilize City procurement procedures to
commission the purchase and installation of such sampling and monitoring
equipment. The City's cost of the sampling and monitoring manhole installation
shall be charged to and collected from the property owner.
      (3)   The City may inspect the facilities and the process and operation
records of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of this
Ordinance. The discharger shall allow the City or its representatives, upon
presentation of credentials of identification, access to all process and
operation documents and to enter upon the premises of the discharger for the
purposes of inspection, sampling or records examination. The Superintendent
shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or
metering operations. The Superintendent shall, at all times have free access to
the premises and process and operation records of any user, and free access to
the premises and process operation records of any person reasonably believed by
the Superintendent to be a user or possible user, for the purpose of
inspecting, sampling or testing the discharge emanating therefrom, or any
discharge which may emanate therefrom in order to determine whether such
discharge, or potential discharge is acceptable or unacceptable to the City.
 
   (j)   Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the
Superintendent with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the discharger demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the City that release of such information would divulge
information entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized as
confidential information. Information accepted by the Superintendent as
confidential, shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency until and
unless a ten day notification is given to the discharger. No permit holder
shall have a claim against the City for release of any information as a
condition of continuance of their permit.
 
   (k)   Bypass.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of any industrial user's treatment facility.
         B.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.
      (2)   Bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause an applicable pretreatment standard to be violated, but only if it is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provisions of subsection (j)(4) hereof.
      (3)   Notice.
         A.   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent at least ten days before the
date of the bypass.
         B.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Superintendent
within twenty-four hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Superintendent o may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within twenty-four hours or is deemed to be
sufficient.
      (4)   Prohibition of bypass.
         A.   Bypass is prohibited and the City may take enforcement action
against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage; or
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and,
         B.   The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the City determines that it shall meet the two conditions
listed in subsection (j)(4)A hereof.
   
   (l)   Notification of Change in Discharge Characteristics. All industrial
users shall promptly notify the Superintendent in writing at least 60 days in
advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge. A substantial change is any change that affects the flow or
pollutant loading by more than ten (10) percent, additional flows or loadings
which cause the total regulated wastestream to surpass the design capacity of
the pretreatment system, or a change in a discharge that would contain the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the Industrial User has
submitted initial notification pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12(p).
 
   (m)   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      (1)   Any User who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and OEPA
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other). If the User discharges more than one hundred
(100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification
also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the User: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation fo the mass and
concentration of such    constituents contained in the wastestream discharged
during the calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months.
All notification must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notification
of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (k) hereof. The
notification requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by Users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards un the self-
monitoring requirements of subsections (b), (d), and (e) hereof.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (l)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes ad specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(c). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the User must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and the
OEPA Hazardous Waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this Section, the User
shall certify that is has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this ordinance, a permit issued
there under, or any applicable Federal or State law.
 
   (n)   Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all Federal
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by
the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review,
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter.
Acceptance after review by the City in no way relieves the discharger from
meeting all pertinent regulations. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operations shall be reported to and be acceptable to
the City prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
 
   (o)   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities shall be required to comply with this Ordinance, the discharger
shall provide a declaration of the shortest compliance schedule by which the
discharger shall provide such additional pretreatment and/or implementation of
additional operation and maintenance activities.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the
requirements of this Ordinance including, but not limited to dates relating to
hiring an engineer, hiring other appropriate personnel, completing preliminary
plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing construction, completing construction and all other acts necessary
to achieve compliance with this Ordinance.
      (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Superintendent permit a time
increment for any single step directed toward compliance which exceeds nine
months.
      (3)   Not later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit a
progress report to the Superintendent including no less than a statement as to
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that
milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event
shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports.
 
   (p)   Start-up of New Sources. New sources shall install and have in
operating condition, and shall "start-up" all pollution control equipment
required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to
discharge. Within the shortest feasible time, not to exceed ninety days, new
sources shall meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
 
   (q)   Accidental Discharges. Each discharger shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or discharges
established by this regulation. Where necessary, facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the discharger's cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Superintendent for review, and shall be approved by the Superintendent before
construction of the facility. Each existing discharger shall complete its plan
and submit same to the Superintendent. No discharger who discharges to the
system shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the City.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
Superintendent shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to
modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this regulation.
Dischargers shall notify the Superintendent immediately upon the occurrence of
a "slug load" or accidental discharge prohibited by this regulation. The
notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type
of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any discharger who
discharges a slug load or accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
liable for any expense, loss or damage to the City, in addition to the amount
of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof under State or federal law.
   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on discharger's
premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug load or
accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or
discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedures.
 
   (r)   Operating Upsets or Other Conditions Resulting in Noncompliance. Any
discharger which experiences an upset in operations or other conditions which
place the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter or
a wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant hereto shall inform the
Superintendent hereof within twenty-four hours of first awareness of the
commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written
follow-up thereof shall be filed by the discharger with the Superintendent
within five days. The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on discharger's compliance status;
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   A documented and verified bona fide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action against a discharger for any noncompliance
with this Ordinance or with any wastewater discharge permit issued pursuant
hereto which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the
period of the upset.
(Ord. 2016-50. Passed 3-21-2016.)
933.12 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER PRETREATMENT ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Notification of Violation. Whenever the Superintendent finds that any
user has violated or is violating any provisions of this Chapter, or a
wastewater permit, or order issued hereunder, the Superintendent may serve upon
such user written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of the receipt
date of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
   (b)    Consent Orders. The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the noncompliance. Such
orders will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent order
shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued.
   (c)    Compliance Order. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate this Chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated.
   Orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably
necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the
installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and
management practices.
   (d)    Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this Chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, the Superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
      (1)    Comply forthwith;
      (2)    Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
         (Ord. 2024-142. Passed 11-4-24.)
933.13 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER PRETREATMENT PENALTIES, COSTS AND DAMAGES.
   (a)    Administrative Fines. Any user who fails to comply with any provision
of this Chapter or with any permit issued pursuant hereto shall be subject to
an administrative fine as follows:
   First violation in a six-month period $500.00
   Second violation in a six-month period $750.00
   All other violations in a six-month period $1000.00 per violation
   Administrative fines are due and payable to the City within thirty (30) days
after written notice of same is issued by the Superintendent. Such notice shall
be delivered to the user personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested. For the purposes of this Chapter, each day on which a violation
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense.
   (b)    Emergency Suspensions.
      (1)    The Superintendent may suspend the wastewater treatment service or
wastewater permit of a user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the Ashtabula
City Water Pollution Control Plant or the environment.
      (2)   Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution.
   In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the Ashtabula City Water Pollution Control Plant, its receiving
stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent shall allow the
user to recommence its discharge with, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
the endangerment has passed and the user is otherwise in compliance with all
other provisions of this Chapter; unless the termination hearings set forth
herein are initiated against the user.
      (3)    A user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of
the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the date of the hearing described in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)    Termination of Permit.
      (1)   Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the
Ashtabula City Water Pollution Control Plant, must first obtain a wastewater
discharge permit from the control authority. Any user who violates the
following conditions of this Chapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order,
or any applicable State or Federal law, is subject to permit termination:
         A.    Violation of permit conditions;
         B.    Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
         C.    Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics; or
         D.    Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
      (2)    Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed
termination of their wastewater permit and be offered an opportunity to show
cause why the proposed action should not be taken.
   (d)    Judicial Remedies. If any user discharges sewage, industrial wastes
or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions
of this Chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, the Superintendent,
through the Ashtabula City Solicitor's Office, may commence an action for
appropriate legal and equitable relief in the Ashtabula Municipal Court or
other appropriate Court.
   (e)    Court Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this Chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, the
Superintendent may petition the appropriate Court for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user. The Superintendent
shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect other sewer
service charges.
   (f)    Public Nuisances. Any violation of the prohibitions or effluent
limitations of this Chapter or permit or order issued hereunder is hereby
declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as instructed by
the Superintendent. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject
to the provisions of this Section, and shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Ashtabula for any costs incurred by the Cities in removing, abating or
remedying such nuisance.
   (g)    Civil Penalties.
      (1)    Any user who as violated or continues to violate this Chapter or
any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the City for a civil
penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus actual damages
incurred by the City of Ashtabula per violation per day for as long as the

(Ord. 2016-50. Passed 3-21-2016.)
933.16 SEWERAGE SERVICE CHARGE.
   (a)   Every person, firm or corporation whose premises are served by a sewer
connection which discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into sewerage facilities under the
jurisdiction of the City shall be charged for the use of such facilities and
for the treatment of such sewage and wastes at the rates established by Chapter
937.
 
   (b)   The sewerage service charge shall be applied to each and every
premises discharging normal sewage into the sewerage system as defined in
Section
933.06.
 
   (c)   The sewerage service charge shall be applied to each and every premise
having a sanitary or combined sewer connection as of the beginning of the next
regularly scheduled billing period following the completion of the building
sewer connection.
 
   (d)   The sewerage service charge shall include, but need not be limited to,
a minimum charge and a commodity charge. The minimum charge shall be based on
minimum water consumption rate of 300 cubic feet per month. The commodity
charge shall be based on the quantity of water used, over 300 cubic feet per
month, as measured by the water meter or meters, which meters shall be
acceptable to the City.
 
   (e)   When a property is served by more than one water meter, a minimum
charge as stipulated in subsection (c) hereof shall be made for each meter. The
charge shall be applied to the consolidated flow, above the minimums, for all
meters except as otherwise provided in subsection (g) hereof.
 
   (f)   When a property is supplied either in whole or in part with water from
wells or any source other than a public water supply, such wells or sources of
supply shall be registered in writing to and on a form furnished by the City.
The sewerage service charge shall be based on the average charge paid by the
owner of a comparable dwelling in the public water supply system. The amount of
such charge shall be approved by the Superintendent. If the owner feels that
the charge is unjust, he may, upon approval of the Superintendent, install, at
his own cost, a meter for measuring consumed water. This meter shall be in
accordance with subsection (n) hereof.
 
   (g)   When a person, firm or corporation can show to the satisfaction of the
City that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not enter
the sewerage system, that person, firm or corporation may submit an application
on a form provided by the City for the installation of a flow meter, as stated
in subsection (n) hereof. The City has the authority to permit or to require an
additional meter, to be installed at the applicant's expense, to measure the
quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system. The quantity of water
used to determine the sewerage service charge shall be the quantity of water
actually entering the sewerage system as so determined.
 
   (h)   When a person, firm or corporation has reason to believe that a
reduction in or exemption from the sewerage service charge is justified, that
person, firm or corporation shall submit a written application to the City and
shall furnish such information as required in support of the request. The
Superintendent shall have the authority to approve, deny or adjust any such
applications.
 
   (i)   When a well or wells are used as a supplementary water supply and are
used for a period not exceeding six months in any calendar year, the minimum
portion of the sewerage service charge may be waived by the City for the period
of non-usage subject to such requirements as he may deem necessary.
 
   (j)   Where the agency supplying the water makes an adjustment in the water
charges as a result of water leakage, an adjustment in the sewerage service
charges shall automatically be made and in the same proportion as the
adjustment in the water charges.
 
   (k)   Except as in subsection (j) hereof, any other reduction in the
sewerage service charges for leakage on any lot, land or premise shall be made
only upon application to the City, and then only in cases where it can be
definitely determined that such leakage could not enter the sewerage system.
 
   (l)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all sewerage
service charges.
 
   (m)   Where a flow meter is required for the proper determination of water
subject to the sewerage service charges, such meter shall be installed only
after approval has been granted by the City. The meter shall be installed,
owned and maintained by the property owner. Venturi meters, flumes, weirs and
other methods of measuring flow shall be used only when authorized by the City.
Meters which shall be approved are as follows:
      (1)   Meters purchased from the utility company supplying the water;
      (2)   Meters, equal or similar to subsection (o)(1) hereof, purchased
elsewhere and tested by the City;
      (3)   Crest or turbine type meters of two-inch size and over, to be used
where it is established the particular meter is under full head at all times;
provided such meters are tested and approved for large constant flows by the
City;
      (4)   Meters used currently for tax purposes by the federal government
shall be accepted without tests; and
      (5)   Existing private meters now in place may be continued in use on a
conditional basis. If such meters are suspected of faulty registration, they
are subject to a test, when so ordered by the City.
         A.   Other meters shall be tested by the manufacturer of the meter and
a certificate of the test shall be furnished to the City. Meters shall not be
used without the written approval of the City.
         B.   It is understood that where an auxiliary meter has been
installed, such a meter shall not be removed without the approval of the City.
 
   (n)   All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards, rules
and regulations of the water supplier and the requirements of the
Superintendent of the Waste Water Treatment Plant. Where private meters are
used on wells, or in an industrial water distribution system, and such meters
are set behind the primary water supply meter, the aforementioned standards,
rules and regulations may be modified or waived by the City.
 
   (o)   When the magnitude of flow or toxic concentration is of such magnitude
so as to overtax the hydraulic or treatment capacity of the system, the
Superintendent may require the industrial dischargers to install equalization
of facilities in order to distribute discharges over a greater time span.

(Ord. 2019-94. Passed 8-19-19.)
939.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities. These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City
Sanitation Division to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the Sanitation Division as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Ashtabula County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Ashtabula
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Ashtabula County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January
1, 2007 are not exempt from the requirements ofthis regulation. In compliance
with the City of Ashtabula Storm Water Management Program, discharges from all
off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems must either be
eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES permit issued and
approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When such permit coverage
is available for systems existing prior to January 1, 2007, discharges from
off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.

person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue. (Ord. 2019-94. Passed 8-19-19.)
939.08 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The Sanitation Division shall establish a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional

facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the Sanitation Division is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the Sanitation Division
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Ashtabula may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 2019-94. Passed 8-19-19.)

reasons for non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement activity.
Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent
certified U.S. mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to O.R.C 3709.211. If a owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of Ashtabula
may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/
operator from activities that would create further violations or compelling the
owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

reimburse the City for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
   (b)   Facilities of a provider who fails to comply with this Section and
which remain unused shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are
deemed to be a violation. The City may exercise any remedies or rights it has

taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a useable condition
subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements of Ohio R.C.
4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or
by the provider's surety. If the City determines to require a provider to

efforts to direct that this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled

(2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.05 CERTIFICATES OF REGISTRATION.
   A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights-of-way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in
accordance with this Chapter
945 and all laws including any rules and regulations adopted by the City. The
rights to locate facilities and/or a system in and the rights to occupy the
right-of-way itself may not be subdivided or subleased; provided, however
provider may sublease capacity (or other nonmaterial facility aspects) and two
or more providers may collocate facilities in the same area of the rights-of-
way so long as each such provider complies with the provisions of this Chapter.
Collocating providers may file a joint application for a construction permit. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocation of its
facilities on facilities of others, including the City's facilities. A
certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from leasing space in
or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of facilities does not
cause a violation of law, including the provisions of this Chapter. A
certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from complying with any
provisions of this Chapter or other applicable law.
(2004 Code)   (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.06 OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a certificate of registration, providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a certificate of registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the

publication costs of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) associated with its

(2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.19 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Technical Information Required. Prior to commencement of any initial
construction of facilities in the rights-of-way a construction permittee, upon
the reasonable request of the City Manager, shall provide technical information
about the proposed route of construction. The technical information required
may consist of completion of the following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights-of- way
along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of the City
Manager, a permittee shall also record and identify the general location of all
other facilities in the rights-of-way along the proposed system route. For the
purposes of this Section, general location shall mean the alignment of other
facilities in the rights-of-way, but shall not necessarily mean the depth of
other facilities in the rights-of-way.
      (4)   If a provider records the information requested above in an
electronic format, the provider shall provide the City with an electronic copy
of the data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section.
Incorporation of the data required herein (Section
945.19(a)(4)) by electronic means shall include only data for new facilities
that can be readily incorporated into the City's database.
      (5)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
the construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than a
three (3) foot by three (3) foot square hole in the rights-of-way to complete
this task.
      (6)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this Section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (7)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein shall be
so labeled.
   (b)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this Section
945.19 shall be performed by a firm qualified in utility engineering or may be
performed by the construction permittee if the construction permittee is
qualified to complete the project itself.
 
   (c)   Cost of Study. The construction permittee shall bear the cost of
compliance with Sections
945.19(a) through
945.19(c) of this Chapter.
   (d)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this Chapter,
or unless the City Manager waives any of the requirements of this Section due
to unique or unusual circumstances, a construction permittee shall be required
to submit a written construction schedule to the City ten (10) working days
before commencing any work in or about the rights-of-way and, shall further
notify the City not less than two (2) working days in advance of any excavation
in the rights-of-way. This Section shall apply to all situations with the
exception of circumstances under Section
945.21(d)(1) (Emergency Situations).
   (e)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
      (2)   The City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights-of-way if the right-of-way is
full. In making such decisions, the City shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights-of-way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the rights-of-way, the time of year, the protection of
existing facilities in the rights-of-way, future City and County plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
      (3)   Upon the concurrence of the City, or if it is determined by the
construction permittee and such determination is reasonably based upon any
appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or other entity with
jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the rights-of-way are
full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or taller poles in order
to accommodate additional facilities or systems only after the construction
permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an acceptable solution without
replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This paragraph shall not apply to
replacement of any existing pole(s) with identically sized pole(s) which
results from the destruction of or hazardous condition of the existing pole(s)
as long as no new facilities or additional facilities are attached.
   (f)   Least Disruptive Technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights- of-way. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights-of-way under this Chapter
may be required, unless technologically impracticable, to be installed in
conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be
installed under this Chapter using "direct bury" techniques.
   (g)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and
relocate its facilities in the rights-of-way whenever the City finds it
necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the City
requests removal and/or relocation, the City shall waive all applicable
construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall
restore the rights- of-way to a condition at least as good as its condition
immediately prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required
to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the City. The City Manager may request relocation and/or removal
in order to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities
with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the City or
County;
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights-of-way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right-of- way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the City, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the City, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the City, within thirty (30) days after the City's removal order is served
upon provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights-of-way of the City, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
law, the City shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the City with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider in,
on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City at provider's cost and expense,
by another person, however the City shall have no liability for any damage
caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the City for all
reasonable costs incurred by the City in such action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights-of-way of the City
designated by the City for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall
belong to and become the property of the City without payment to the provider,
and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the City shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the City, to evidence such
ownership by the City.
   (h)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location. Before the start date of any
rights-of-way excavation, each provider who has facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every
reasonable attempt using best efforts, to mark the approximate vertical
placement of all its facilities. All providers shall notify and work closely
with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   (i)   Rights-of-Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the Restoration of the
rights-of- way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
City Engineer, subject to any applicable laws. The permittee must also inspect
the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same condition for
twelve (12) months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an application for a permit, the City may choose
either to have the permittee restore the right-of-way or the City may restore
the right-of- way itself at the expense of the permittee.
      (3)   If the City chooses to allow the permittee to restore the rights-
of-way, the construction permittee shall at the time of application of a
construction permit post a construction bond in an amount determined by the
City to be sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights-of-way to
condition at least as good as its condition immediately prior to construction.
If, twelve (12) months after completion of the restoration of the rights-of-
way, the City determines that the rights-of-way have been properly restored,
the surety on the construction bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the City.
      (5)   By restoring the right-of-way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the City
Manager, correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method
required by the City Manager. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed
within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the City
Manager.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in the manner
and to the condition required by the City, or fails to satisfactorily complete
all repairs required by the City in a timely manner, the City, at its option,
with notice to provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In
that event, the permittee shall pay to the City, within thirty (30) days of
billing, the cost of restoring the rights-of-way and any other costs incurred
by the City. Upon failure to pay, the City may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.
   (j)   Damage to Provider's Facilities and to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the City
performs work in the rights-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
thirty (30) days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the City may
pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or
the City may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and
pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights-of-way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the City's response to an
emergency caused by such provider's facilities.
   (k)   Rights-of-Way Vacation. If the City vacates a right-of-way which
contains the facilities of a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 723.04.1.
   (l)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights-of-way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws and the standards as promulgated by the
City Manager.
   (m)   Inspection.
      (1)   When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall notify the City Manager.
      (2)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this Chapter.
      (4)   The inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in Section 
945.24 (d). An order may be appealed to the City Manager. The decision of the
City Manager may be appealed to the Planning Commission whose decision shall be
final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance of the order, the
provider shall present proof to the City Manager that the violation has been
corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the required time, the
City Manager may revoke the permit pursuant to Section
945.21 (e).
   (n)   Other Obligations. Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and
authority and to pay all fees, including on site inspection fees, required by
the City, or any other City, County, State, or Federal laws.
      (1)   A permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service (OUPS) and/or its
lawful successor.
      (2)   A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable laws and standards and is responsible for all work done in the
rights-of-way pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (3)   No rights-of-way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in Section
945.21 (d)(1).
      (4)   A permittee shall not so obstruct a right-of-way that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with.
      (5)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (o)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied. This requirement may be waived by the City Manager or the Planning
Commission.

arterials that takes less than eight (8) contiguous hours to complete, does not
impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut.
      (1)   A minor maintenance permit allows the minor maintenance permittee
to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the rights-of-way as required.
      (2)   A minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of issuance until
December 31 of the year in which the minor maintenance permit was issued at
which time the minor maintenance permit shall expire.
      (3)   A minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon request
produced within twelve (12) business hours.
      (4)   A minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no circumstances
provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without seeking additional
authority from the City Manager.
   (b)   Minor Maintenance Permit Applications. Application for a minor
maintenance permit shall be made to the City Manager. In addition to any
information required by the City Manager, all minor maintenance permit
applications shall contain, and will only be considered complete upon
compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a certificate of
registration or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for a

shall be exempt. Minor maintenance permit fees that were paid for a minor
maintenance permit that the City has revoked due to breach are not refundable.
The City Manager may revoke the minor maintenance permit as any other permit
may be revoked under this Chapter.
(2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.21 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
construction permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application if such
application is required pursuant to this Chapter or the Codified Ordinances; or
      (2)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
City; or
      (3)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the City Manager, the issuance of a permit
for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an
exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The City Manager, in
exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and convenience of
ordinary travel of the public over the rights-of-way, and by considerations
relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial. The City Manager may deny a permit in order to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent interference with
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, or when
necessary to protect the rights-of-way and its users. The City Manager, in his
or her discretion, may consider one or more of the following factors: the
extent to which rights-of-way space where the permit is sought is available;
the competing demands for the particular space in the rights-of-way; the
availability of other locations in the rights-of-way or in other rights-of-way
for the proposed facilities; the applicability of this Chapter or other
regulations of the rights-of-way that affect location of facilities in the
rights-of- way; the degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of this Chapter and its requirements, and other applicable
ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding communities
and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights-of-
way; the condition and age of the rights-of-way, and whether and when it is
scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the costs of
disruption to the public and damage to the rights-of-way, against the benefits
to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional parts of the
rights-of-way; and whether such applicant or their agent has failed within the
past three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance, with
the requirements of this Chapter or, if applicable, any other Chapters of the
Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable law.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
945.21(a)(1) and
945.21(a)(2), the City Manager may issue a permit in any case where the permit
is necessary:
      (1)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the City;
      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
      (3)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a permit
under this Section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit.
      (1)   Emergency Situations. Each provider shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify the City Manager of any event regarding its facilities
which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take
whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within two
(2) business days, unless otherwise extended by the City Manager, after the
occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider
shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and
fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with
this Chapter for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the
event that the City becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider’s
facilities, the City may attempt to contact the provider or system
representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the City may take whatever action it deems necessary
in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be borne by the
provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Non-Emergency Situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right-
of-way without a valid permit shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
Codified Ordinances, deposit with the City the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the rights-of-way and comply with all of the requirements of this
Chapter.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The City reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the City or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or
         D.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
Section 
945.19 (m)(4).
      (2)   If the City Manager determines that the permittee has committed a
substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit, the City Manager shall serve a written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a substantial
breach, as stated above, the City Manager may place additional or revised
conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, the permittee shall contact the City Manager with a
plan, acceptable to the City Manager, for its correction. Permittee’s failure
to so contact the City Manager, or the permittee's failure to submit an
acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved
plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the City Manager may establish a list of
standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any condition shall
also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights-of-way as defined in
Section
945.15 .
      (5)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee shall
not be allowed further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the City
for the City's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs of
collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.
         (2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.22 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the County or City, shall deposit with the
City Manager, in a form acceptable to the City Solicitor, an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount determined by
the City Manager to be appropriate, based upon fair and reasonable criteria.
Unless a construction default, problem, or deficiency involves an emergency or
endangers the safety of the general public, the City Manager shall serve the
construction permittee with notice detailing any construction default, problem,
or deficiency. If the City Manager determines that correction or repair of the
construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been
substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the date following
service of notification and detailing the construction default, problem or
deficiency, then the City may attach the letter of credit or surety bond. Upon
attachment, written notice shall be served on the construction permittee by the
City Manager.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration, and
continuously thereafter until one hundred twenty (120) days after a provider 's
facilities have been removed from the rights-of-way, (unless the City Manager
notifies the provider that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider
shall deposit with the City Manager and maintain, in a form acceptable to the
City Solicitor, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or a surety bond
in an amount equal to or greater than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00). The
City Manager shall make all reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of
five (5) business days after serving notification to correct or repair any
default, problem or deficiency prior to City Manager's attachment of letter of
credit or surety bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment,
written notice shall be provided to the provider by the City Manager.
   (c)   Blanket Bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by Section
945.22(a) and the removal bond required by Section
945.22(b), provider may deposit with the City Manager, in a form acceptable to
the City Solicitor, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or
surety bond in the amount of three million dollars ($3,000,000.00). Unless a
construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers
the safety of the general public, the City Manager shall make all reasonable
efforts to allow permittee a period of five (5) business days after sending
notification in writing to the last known business address to correct or repair
any construction default, problem or deficiency prior to City Manager's
attachment of letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice
shall be provided to the provider by the City Manager.
   (d)   Self Bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by Section
945.22(a), the removal bond required by Section
945.22(b) and the blanket bond required by Section
945.22(c), those providers maintaining a book value in excess of twenty million
dollars ($20,000,000.00) may submit a statement to the City Manager requesting
to self-bond. If approval to self-bond is granted, a provider shall assure the
City that such self-bonding shall provide the City with no less protection and
security than would have been afforded to the City by a third party surety
providing provider with the types and amounts bonds detailed in the above named
Sections. This statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and,
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the City Manager.
   (e)   Purposes. The bonds required by this Section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this Chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the City occasioned by
the permittee or provider's violation of this Chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the City
issued pursuant to this Chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the City, including permit
fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums for the liability insurance required
pursuant to this Chapter;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights-of-way pursuant to this
Chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the City of any amounts for which the permittee or
provider is liable that are not paid by insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the City
pursuant to this Chapter or other law.
(f)   Form. The bond documents required by this Section, and any replacement
bond documents shall, contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to the City of
surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond."
(2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.23 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   City Does Not Accept Liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
application or the grant of a permit, the City does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of facilities.
 
   (b)   Indemnification. By applying for and being issued a certificate of
registration with the City a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a
permittee is required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and
subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of
any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance,
repair, replacement, restoration, or operation of its facilities, or out of any
activity undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider or
permittee further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any
action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief
against the City's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers
and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a right-of-way, whether the act or omission complained of
is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This Section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider, permittee, or to the City; and the provider or permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the City, if allowable by law, shall be
entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the City could
assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent
with, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the City, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation Worker's Compensation claims against the City or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the City in connection therewith:
         A.   To persons or property, to the extent arising out of or through
the acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights-of-
way, to which permittee's or provider's negligence shall in any way contribute.
         B.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider or permittee, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to City programming.
         C.   Arising out of provider's or permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of any law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the City:
         A.   Giving provider or permittee reasonable notice of any claim or
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         B.   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the City's control.
      (3)   The City shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expense of such separate counsel if employed.
         (2004 Code) (Ord. 2004-110. Passed 10-18-04.)
945.24 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Non-Exclusive Remedy. The remedies provided in this Chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the City may have at law
or in equity. The City is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the rights-of-way,
including damages to the rights-of-way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of applicable law.
   (b)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this Chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, non-appealable order that any permit, right or any portions of this
Chapter are illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60)
days written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating
to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right
shall be considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City to issue such revocable permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (c)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The City by the granting
of a permit, or by issuing a certificate of registration under this Chapter,
does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful
powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the City
under the Constitution and laws of the United States, State of Ohio, and under
the Charter of the City of Ashtabula to regulate the use of the rights-of-way.
The permittee by its acceptance of a permit, or provider by applying for and
being issued a certificate of registration, agrees that all lawful powers and
rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may
be from time to time vested in or reserved to the City, shall be in full force
and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the City at any time. A
permittee or provider is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to
the regulatory and police powers of the City to adopt and enforce general
ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to
agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the City pursuant
to such powers.
   (d)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the City Manager or Planning
Commission shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is:
      (1)   Delivered personally; or
      (2)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served; or
      (3)   Left at the usual place of business of the person to whom it is to
be served upon and with someone who is 18 years of age or older; or
      (4)   Sent by certified, preposted U.S. mail to the last known address;
or
      (5)   If the notice is attempted to be served by certified, preposted
U.S. mail and then returned showing that the letter was not delivered, or the
certified letter is not returned within fourteen (14) days after the date of
mailing, then notice may be sent by regular, preposted, first-class U.S.; or
      (6)   If the notice is attempted to be served by regular, first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the
letter was not delivered, or is not returned within fourteen (14) days after
the date of mailing, then notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or
about the structure, building, premises or property affected by such notice.
   (e) Applies To All Providers. This Chapter shall apply to all providers and
all permittees unless expressly exempted.
   (f)   Police Powers. Each person's rights are subject to the police powers
of the City to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public. All persons shall comply with all applicable
laws enacted by City pursuant to its police or other powers. In particular, all
persons shall comply with City zoning and other land use requirements
pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities.
   (g)   Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this Chapter by reason of any failure of City to
enforce prompt compliance.
   (h)   Foreclosure and Receivership.
      (1)   Upon the filing of any voluntary or involuntary petition under the
Bankruptcy Act by or against any provider and/or permittee, or any action for
foreclosure or other judicial sale of the provider and/or permittee’s
facilities located within the rights-of-way, the provider and/or permittee
shall so notify the City Manager within fourteen (14) calendar days thereof and
the provider and/or permittee's certificate of registration or permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.
      (2)   The City shall have the right to revoke, pursuant to the provisions
of this Chapter, any certificate of registration or permit granted pursuant to
this Chapter, subject to any applicable provisions of law, including the
Bankruptcy Act, one hundred and twenty (120) days after the appointment of a
receiver or trustee to take over and conduct the business of the provider and/
or permittee, whether in receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said one hundred and twenty (120) days or
unless:
         A.    Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after election or
appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the
provisions of the relevant certificate of registration, any outstanding permit
and of this Chapter and remedied all defaults thereunder; and,
         B.    Said receiver or trustee, within said one hundred and twenty
(120) days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having
jurisdiction over the facilities, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by each and every provision of the relevant certificate of
registration, permit, and this Chapter.
  
   (i)   Choice of Law and Forum. This Chapter and the terms and conditions of
any certificate of registration or permit shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio and the laws of the
United States of America, specifically in that order. All providers and
permittees as a condition for the grant of any permit or issuance of any
certificate of registration agree that all disputes shall be resolved in a
court of competent jurisdiction in Ashtabula County, Ohio.
   (j)   Force Majeure. In the event any person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions, or obligations required by this Chapter
945 is prevented by a cause or event not within such person's control, such
inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions
shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this Section, causes
or events not within the control of a provider shall include, without
limitation, acts of God, strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances,
explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes, landslides, and fires.
   (k)   No Warranty. The City makes no representation or warranty regarding
its right to authorize the construction of facilities on any particular rights-
of-way. The burden and responsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the person constructing facilities in the rights-of-way.
   (l)   Continuing Obligation and Holdover. In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the facilities after the termination, lapse, or
revocation of a certificate of registration, such provider shall continue to
comply with all applicable provisions of this Chapter and other laws throughout
the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued
operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the
certificate of registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any,
available to the City as a result of such continued operation after the term,
including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between
the issuance of a certificate of registration or of a permit and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the City's regulatory or police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter.
   (m)   Appeals. All appeals provided for by this chapter and any notification
to the City required by this Chapter shall be in writing and sent via certified
mail to the Planning Commission or City Manager as specified in this Chapter.
   (n)   City Standards. As part of City required standards, wherever rights-
of-way are under construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the City
Manager, the City may install all such facilities deemed necessary to
accommodate future provider needs. Any such installed facilities shall be City
property and may be conveyed to any person under such terms and conditions as
are deemed advisable by the City Manager.
  
   (o)   Chapter Headings. Chapter headings are for convenience only and shall
not be used to interpret any portion of this Chapter.

   (a)   Applicable Collection Rate; Surcharge. Effective May 1, 2017, each
residential unit shall pay fifteen dollars and fifty cents ($15.50) per month,
or any portion thereof, plus the current Fuel Cost Surcharge (FCS) as
calculated and defined below, payable upon receipt of a statement for same;
each two (2) unit residence shall pay thirty-one dollars ($31.00) per month or
potion thereof, plus the current (FCS); and each three (3) unit residence shall
pay forty-six dollars and fifty cents ($46.50) per month or portion thereof,
plus the current FCS. There is hereby created a Fuel Cost Surcharge which shall
be added to each residential billing, as set forth above. The Fuel Cost
Surcharge (FCS) is defined to be an additional charge based upon the cost of
fuel per gallon as established by reference to the United States Energy
Information Administration (EIA) Weekly On-Highway Diesel Prices - Average All
Types-United States, to be recalculated bimonthly commencing with the week of
May 1, 2017. The current FCS shall be calculated as follows: a surcharge of
0.05% of the applicable collection rate shall be added for each one cent
($0.01) of fuel cost over and above a base rate of ninety-five cents ($0.95)
per gallon. By way of illustration only, if the average cost of fuel in the
United States as determined by reference to the above publication is four
dollars and one cent ($4.01) per gallon, then the surcharge shall be 15.5% of
the applicable collection rate.
   The total monthly rate, as calculated above, shall be pro-rated on a daily
basis with an assumed 30-days-per-month for any service periods of less than a
full month which need to be billed or paid.
   (b)   Multiple dwellings shall be billed at the aforementioned single
residential unit monthly rate fifteen dollars and fifty cents ($15.50) plus
current (FCS) per residence, with each apartment considered a separate
residence. The property owner shall be responsible for providing adequate

receive City residential, curb-side service at the foregoing established rate
per month, in accordance with the aforementioned billing procedures.

abnormal amounts of material may be picked up and removed by the Sanitation
Department for an additional charge as established prior to collection and
before material is placed by the curb by the Superintendent or his or her
authorized agent. Residents are required to pay for this service in advance. In
areas where curbside recycling is available, accumulation of solid waste
exceeding the one container limit will require residents to have an additional
sixty-four (64) gallon City container and an additional ten dollars ($10.00) a
month will be added to the rate for service. Residents requiring an additional
container for recycling materials shall not be charged an extra fee per month.

such notice, using its facilities. The cost of labor and equipment thus
expended for the collection and disposal of the accumulation shall be billed to
the person, business, firm or corporation in charge of the property, which bill

      (2)    Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger: A development site that
disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
      A.    Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must be
able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels, stream
erosion control, and improved water quality.
      B.    Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
      C.    Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv, shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of
the two following methods:
         1.    Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local municipal
permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-
term hourly precipitation records or
         2.    Using the following equation:
         1.   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in acre-
feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (see Table
1) P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth A= area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (< 4 dwellings/acre)       0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
      D.    Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be
calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1 )(0.2) =
0.35.
      E.    An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
      F.    BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below.
Table 2: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction
Treatment Control Practices

outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.    Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.    An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            4.    Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.    The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)    Water Quality Basin: If a Water Quality Basin is needed and can
not be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin
then a separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed,
constructed and maintained into perpetuity.
      (10)    Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)    Flexibility: These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the City Engineer to impose at any time additional and/or
more stringent requirements nor shall the standards limit the right of the City
Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         A.    If the City Engineer waives, in writing, individual requirements
the owner will provide the City Engineer with the information and documentation
required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will not degrade water
quality.
            (Ord. 2016-68. Passed 5-2-16.)
975.14 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   Where the City Engineer determines that site constraints exist in a manner
that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management of storm
water runoff as established in this chapter, practical alternatives may be used
to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of storm water
runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and likely cost of
those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the objectives of this
section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be implemented within
the drainage area of the proposed development project. Practical alternatives
can include, but are not limited to:
   (a)    Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the City Engineer. The
City shall apply these fees to storm water management practices that improve
the existing water quality.

practices not specifically waived by the City shall be constructed prior to the
granting of the Final Plat Approval. Upon the request of the owner, the City
may defer the construction or installation of a permanent storm water, soil
erosion, sediment control or water quality practice prior to the approval of
the final plat where, in the City Engineer's judgment, such proper construction
or installation is not immediately necessary for the protection of the public
health and safety; and where the prior installation or construction of such
improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case
of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete,
building construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six (6) months after the filing of such final plat.

Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer sufficient for the City to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible for
the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for the
development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation. The
Security Bond, Escrow Account Verified Check or Cash shall be released only
after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer and all permit and inspection fees required

and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)    Time Extension: The City Engineer may extend the time allowed for the
installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been
provided with the receipt of a written request from the owner.
   (e)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment control, and
water quality practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided,
the owner shall notify the City Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection: The City will not release the Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the City Engineer has inspected
the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed and/or
removed.
   (g)    Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released
by the City until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices
that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and any
trapped sediment has been stabilized.

storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

specifications, including detailed drawings, for each BMP. This list shall
include:
            1.   Methods of controlling the flow of runoff from disturbed areas
so as to prevent or minimize erosion.
            2.   Identification of the Structural Practices to be used to
control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than
14 days. A description shall be included of how each selected control will
store runoff so as to let sediments settle out and/or divert flows away from
exposed soils or act to limit runoff from exposed areas.
            3.   Identification for each Structural Practice of its size,
detail drawings, maintenance requirements and design calculations.
            4.   The type and amount of plant seed, live plants, fertilizer,
agricultural ground limestone and mulch to be used. Specification of soil

centralized sediment control capable of controlling multiple individual lots, a
detail drawing of a project specific typical individual lot showing standard
individual lot soil erosion and sediment control practices and the sequence and
timing of BMP installation for the individual lots. This does not remove or
eliminate the responsibility to designate and install specific soil erosion and
sediment control practices for the storm water discharges.
         C.   The Construction Site Conservation Plan shall include the
scheduling, phasing, and coordination of construction operations and erosion
and sediment control BMPs, including vegetative plantings and mulch.
      (3)   The Construction Site Conservation Plan shall include a description
of the Storm Water Management (SWM) practices to be used on the site. The SWM
element of the Plan shall include, at a minimum, the following:

walls or any other obstructions to the free flow of storm water and the
movement of inspectors and maintenance eguipment and also restricted against
the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan. (Ord.
2016-69. Passed 5-2-16.)
977.13 MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance plans shall be provided by the permittee to both the
Community Engineer and the post-construction operator of the BMP (including
homeowner associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to
the Community Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (b)   Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments: A Homeowners'
Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and
shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and
inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
   (c)   Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments: The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
   (d)   Maintenance Design: All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
   (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections: One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water: A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements: A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a high risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the Community Engineer: A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified
Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life: A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
         (Ord. 2016-69. Passed 5-2-16.)
977.14 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers: Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below.
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage
                                        area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale Barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices: Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices: Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanentJy restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas: Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:

                                        Engineer shall then inspect the lot to
                                        ensure that the temporary seeding has
                                        been done.
Disturbed area will be idle over winter Prior to the onset of winter weather
 
   Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability
or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner can
show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use the alternatives in the
(Ohio EPA NPDES Permit for Construction Activity) Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) for the site.
         B.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 1 0
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or Sediment Traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 72 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width(> 2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five (5) feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by 40%.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection:
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets: All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, Or Crossing Streams and Wetlands:
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance:
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Nonerosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils:
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes: Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels: Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation: A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices: All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction: The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment it must
pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the State.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections:
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven (7)
calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable.
The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from
meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The owner, or his designated representative, shall keep a written
log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil erosion,
sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections shall include
the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, weather conditions, and
the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (5)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
      (11)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within 10 days of the inspection.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten (10) days from the date of inspection.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of Materials and Debris: Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and State's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110% of the volume of the largest container in the storage area. All
additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed. If the
fuel tanks have a self-contained "dike," the plug will be kept in the "dike"
tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial landuse or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shalt be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant
   (v)   Pre-winter Stabilization: If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a Pre-Winter Stabilization Meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the Community
Engineer to the meeting.
   (w)   Storm Water Basins:
      (1)   Pool Geometry: The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment: The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains: Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves: Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ring bolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway: Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the County. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway: An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments: Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features:
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community Engineer
to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rocklined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
         (Ord. 2016-69. Passed 5-2-16.)
977.15 STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate: The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume: Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
predevelopment storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in paragraph (1) determine the percent of increase
in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q after
divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the critical
storm from this table:
Table 5: Critical Storm Selection
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff Is:
Equal To Or  And Less Than The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” For Discharge Will Be
Greater Than
0            10            1 Year
10           20            2 Years
20           50            5 Years
50           100           10 Years
100          250           25 Years
250          500           50 Years
500          ---           100 Years
 
   (c)   Detention or Retention Basin Exemption for Redevelopment or for
Expansion of Existing Facilities:
      (1)   For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one ( 1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community
Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm
sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in
a manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management
of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives
may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be
implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project.
Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   A Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Community
Engineer. These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water
management practices that reduce existing storm water runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (5)   Other practices approved by the Community Engineer in keeping with
the intent of this section.

(Ord. 2016-69. Passed 5-2-16.)
977.17 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   (a)   All permanent storm water, soil erosion, other wastes control, and
water quality practices not specifically waived by the Community shall be
constructed prior to the granting of the Final Plat Approval. Upon the request
of the owner, the Community may defer the construction or installation of a
permanent storm water, soil erosion, sediment, or other wastes control or water
quality practice prior to the approval of the final plat where, in the
Community Engineer's judgment such proper construction or installation is not
immediately necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and
where the prior installation or construction of such improvement would
constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case of new vegetation
or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete, building
construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow
Account, Certified Check or Cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six (6) months after the filing of such final plat
   (b)   The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent
improvements, and soil erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices.
   (c)   The Community shall require a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified
Check or Cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent soil
erosion, sediment and other wastes controls and water quality practices will be
constructed and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community
Engineer.
      (1)   The Guarantee: The guarantee of both performance and maintenance
will be in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account Verified Check or Cash.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment and other wastes control
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The Security Bond,
Escrow Account Verified Check or Cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the Ohio R.C. 711.101.
         A.    Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, City Manager or Review Boards.
         B.    No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a
Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this regulation, and to allow all work to
be performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for
the development area fails to comply with the provisions of this regulation.
The Security Bond, Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash shall be released
only after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
         C.    No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
Construction Site Conservation Plan having been approved by the Community
Engineer.
      (2)   Performance Guarantee: The furnishing of a performance guarantee
will be maintained in an amount of not less than 120% of the estimate approved
by the Community Engineer, of installation of the deferred improvements.
      (3)   Maintenance Guarantee: The maintenance guarantee shall be
maintained for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance
of the storm water, soil erosion, sediment and other wastes control practices
in an amount equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer,
of the construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
      (4)   Time Extension: The Community Engineer may extend for cause the
time allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
      (5)   Completion: Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent soil erosion, sediment and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
      (6)   Inspection: The Community will not release the Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer
has inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been
completed and/or removed.
      (7)   Slow Release Devices: Performance and maintenance guarantees will
be maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed
in detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80%, or better.
      (8)   Release: The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be
released by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
         (Ord. 2016-69. Passed 5-2-16.)
977.18 APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTION CONSERVATION PLANS (CCP).
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the Post-Construction Water Quality,
Riparian Setback and Wetland Setback Plans that have also been developed for
the site.
   (b)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the Community in
accordance with this regulation do not relieve the site owner of responsibility
for obtaining and complying with all other necessary permits and/or approvals
from federal, state, county and local agencies and departments. If requirements
vary, the most stringent requirement shall be followed. Plans submitted to the
Community Engineer for review and approval, shall be accompanied by all other
required permits and documentation relevant to the project, including but not
limited to the permits required and issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Ohio EPA and ODNR Division of Water.
   (c)   The application must include a letter or report from the local county

the grounds thereof. The City Engineer shall forthwith transmit to the Board
all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from is
taken.
   (b)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of action appealed
from, unless the City Manager certifies to the Board, after the notice of
appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or

application or notice to the City Manager and on due cause shown.

(Ord. 10277. Passed 11-4-85.)
1111.04 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Administrative Board shall have the following powers and duties:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the City Engineer in the
enforcement of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   To interpret the provisions of this Zoning Code in such a way as to
carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the map fixing the
several districts accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Code, where the
street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on
the map.
   (c)   To determine whether an industry should be permitted within the M
Industrial Districts because of the methods by which it would be operated and
the minimizing of dust, odor, gas, smoke or noise.
   (d)   To authorize, upon appeal, whenever a property owner can clearly show
that, due to peculiar, unusual conditions applicable to his property and not to
surrounding property generally the strict application of the terms of this
Zoning Code results in unusual practical difficulties and particular hardship,
such variation in the terms of this chapter as are in harmony with its general
purpose and intent, but only when the Board is satisfied that the variation is
necessary to alleviate the unusual hardship and does not merely serve as a
convenience to the applicant.
   (e)   To permit, upon appeal, the following exceptions:
      (1)   The extension of a district where the boundary line of a district
divides a lot in single ownership at the time of the adoption of this Zoning
Code.
      (2)   The reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been
destroyed or partially destroyed, by fire or act of God, by more than seventy-
five percent (75%) where the Board shall find some compelling public necessity
requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use.
      (3)   The erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any
location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which the
Board deems reasonably necessary for the public convenience or welfare.
      (4)   Variation of the parking and loading requirements of this Zoning
Code whenever it is clearly demonstrated that the provision of the full parking
or loading facilities is unnecessary in any district or where such a
requirement would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lots, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (5)   A temporary building used in conjunction with construction work,
but only for the period, not exceeding one year unless the permit is renewed,
during which the construction is in progress, provided that any such temporary
building shall be removed on completion of the construction work.
         (1980 Code 153.23)
1111.05 DECISIONS OF BOARD.
   (a)   The concurring vote of four members of the Administrative Board shall

the City Manager, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this Zoning Code, or to effect any variation
in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   In exercising the above mentioned powers, the Board may, in conformity
with the provisions of the law, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may
make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made,
and to that end shall have all the powers of the City Engineer.

1137.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)   "Alteration" means any change, demolition, removal or construction
involving any buildings or structures located on any real property subject to
the provisions of this chapter. The alteration shall not be related to ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property provided that such work involves no
change in material, design, texture, color or outer appearance of such
property. "Alteration" includes any change to features such as shades or
draperies which are visible from the exterior of the building.
   (b)   "Preservation" means the process of sustaining the form and extent of
a structure essentially as it now exists. Preservation aims at halting further
deterioration and providing structural stability but does not contemplate
significant rebuilding.
   (c)   "Reconstruction" means the process ofreproducing by new construction
the exact form and detail of a vanished structure, or part of it, as it
appeared at a specific period of time. Reconstruction should be undertaken only
when the property to be reconstructed is essential for understanding and
interpreting the value of a historic district and sufficient historical
documentation exists to insure an exact reproduction of the original.
   (d)   "Rehabilitation" means the process of returning a property to a state
of utility, through repair or alteration, which makes possible and efficient
contemporary use. In rehabilitation, those portions of the property which are
important in illustrating historic and cultural values are preserved or
restored.
   (e)   "Restoration" means the process of accurately recovering the form and
details of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means
ofremoval of later work and the replacement of missing original work.

upon approval of the Division of Planning & Community Development for
compliance with this Section and the AHPC for compliance with all other H-
1 District standards.
   (b)   For purposes of this Section:
      (1)   "Townhouse" is defined as:
         A.   Any structure that is or that appears to be a single building
containing not less than two (2) or more than three (3) residential dwelling
units; or
         B.    Two (2) or three (3) separate but contiguous residential units
separated by a common wall or walls as defined herein; when the units are
separately deeded to the owners thereof as real property.
      (2)   "Common areas" are defined as those portions of a townhouse unit
that are not described or included within the description of any individual
unit, but which are utilized by all unit owners and their invitees, or which
are necessary for the integrity of the building's structure.
      (3)   "Limited common areas" are defined as those portions of a townhouse
unit that are not described or included within the description of any
individual unit, but which are utilized primarily by the owners of an
individual unit and their invitees.
      (4)   "Common walls" are either walls which form a division between
separate units or which are exterior walls that are not separated from each
other by a space sufficient for access for maintenance, repair, or
reconstruction purposes.
   (c)   In order to be approved, a proposed townhouse development or project
must meet the following minimum qualifications:
      (1)   Each unit must contain not less than two (2) bedrooms and one (1)
full bathroom;
      (2)   Each unit must have its own kitchen;
      (3)   Each unit must have its own HVAC unit(s) and water heaters, and its

per acre. Townhouse lot sizes shall not be less than 2400 square feet, and
frontage per unit shall not be less than 24 feet. Height of structures shall

   (e)   Townhouse developments must be subject to recorded covenants and
restrictions which incorporate the requirements of this Section and which
provide for apportionment of expenses related to maintenance, repair and
replacement of common areas, limited common areas, common walls, shared drives
or sidewalks, and roofs and exterior siding if such components are of
continuous construction. Said covenants and restrictions shall provide that the
City of Ashtabula has standing to enforce them in the event of a violation
which is (a) a violation of the City's fire, housing or building codes, and (b)
is not corrected within 60 days of written notice from the City to the owner(s)
of the affected unit(s). The City Solicitor shall review and approve such
covenants and restrictions solely for compliance with the requirements of this

building, or zoning code violations.
   (g)   The purpose of this Section is to provide for attractive and
responsible development of housing within the H-1 Historical District that is
compatible with preservation of its character. The City Council finds and
determines that the City has a substantial and compelling interest in
discouraging passive investor ownership by reason of numerous fire, safety and
housing violations associated with ownership by absentee landlords who neglect
properties. The further intent is to encourage persons owning real property or
dwelling there have an incentive to become knowledgeable with and concerned
about the problems and needs of the area. In enacting this requirement, the
City Council finds that the restrictions are reasonably related to this
purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person's right to purchase other properties
or obtain other housing that may be more suited to their investment goals or
residential preferences.

requirements of Chapter
1187 shall be applied in conjunction with the requirements of this Chapter. In
the event of a conflict, the requirements of this Chapter shall govern.

effective date of this chapter is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of
employees, seating capacity, or otherwise to create a need for an increase of
ten percent (10%) or more in the number of existing parking spaces, such spaces
shall be provided on the basis of the enlargements or change. Whenever a
building or use existing prior to the effective date of this chapter is
enlarged to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or more in floor area or in the

free as practicable from dust, paper and other loose particles, and snow and
ice shall be promptly removed by the operator. All adjacent sidewalks shall be
kept free from dirt, ice, sleet and snow and in a safe condition for use by

(2004 Code)
1152.02 PURPOSE AND AUTHORIZATION.
   A conditional use permit shall be obtained for certain uses, which would

welfare of the surrounding area. The authorization of a conditional use permit
shall not be made unless the evidence presented is such to establish:
   (a)   That such use will not, under the specific circumstances of the
particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the

specified in this Code for such use;
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall itemize, describe or justify, then have

drainage, potable water, sanitary sewer, and police and fire protection or will
exist to serve the requested use at the time such facilities are needed.
   (f)   Can demonstrate adequate provision for maintenance of the use of
associated structures;
   (g)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;

location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, street and traffic
accesses, open spaces, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards,
landscaping features and such other information as the Planning Commission may
require;
   (h)   A fee as established by ordinance;
      (2004 Code)
1152.05 REVIEW OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (a)   Before making a decision as to whether to approve, disapprove or
approve with conditions a conditional use permit application, the Planning
Commission shall:
      (1)   Refer to any applicable entity as established for review and
approval of specific uses in specific districts and await its recommendations
which shall be formulated no later than the regular meeting following that at
which the application was first received by the reviewing board, and which
shall be forwarded promptly to the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Schedule, advertise and duly hold a public hearing for any
conditional use proposed. Notification of the hearing shall be placed in a
newspaper of general circulation at least ten days before the date of the
hearing. Notification of the hearing shall also be mailed by the Building
Commissioner at least ten days before the arranged date to all owners, as they
appear in the records then maintained in the office of the Building
Commissioner (being copies of County tax records), of abutting and adjacent
land of the proposed site. All such advertising and notification costs shall be
borne by the property owner requesting such conditional use. The actual costs
for postage and processing such notice shall be charged to and reimbursed by
the person or corporation who or which submitted the application for the
conditional use. The actual costs shall be reimbursed to the City prior to the
public hearing. If any property owner fails to receive this notice as provided
herein, such failure shall in no way invalidate any actions, proceedings or
determinations by the City as provided for in this chapter.
         (2004 Code)
   (b)   Upon hearing any necessary and required recommendations, after holding
any necessary public hearing and in any event within sixty days after the
receipt of the required approvals, the Planning Commission shall instruct the
Building Commissioner of its final decision. The Planning Commission may grant
two extensions of up to thirty days each upon which it has to act on the
application, provided the applicant has requested an extension in writing to
the Planning Commission.
   (c)   The Planning Commission, in recommending approval for a conditional
use shall set forth any specific terms or conditions deemed necessary to ensure
compliance with the intent and standards of this Zoning Code.
(2004 Code)
1152.06 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION.
   A conditional use permit shall be considered exercised when the use has been
established or when a building permit has been issued and the substantial
construction accomplished. When such permit is abandoned or discontinued for a
period of one year, it shall not be reestablished, unless authorized by the
Planning Commission on appeal. A conditional use permit shall be revoked when
the applicant fails to comply with all the conditions imposed by the Planning
Commission.

1153.01 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Any lawful use of a building existing at the effective date of this
Zoning Code may be continued, even though the use does not conform to the
provisions hereof, but no building shall be enlarged or extended. If no
structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of the building may be
changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted
classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more
restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed
to a less restricted use. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended
throughout those parts thereof which are more manifestly arranged or designed
for such use at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Whenever the use of a building shall become nonconforming through a
change in the zoning regulations or in the district boundaries, such use may be
continued and, if no structural alterations are made, may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification.
   (c)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a building or portion thereof is
discontinued for a continuous period of one year, such nonconforming use shall
be deemed to be abandoned, and any future use of such building or portion
thereof shall be in conformity with the regulations of the district in which
such building is located.
   (d)   A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than seventy-five percent
(75%) of its reproduction value at the time of damage shall not be restored,
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located. When damaged by less than seventy-five percent (75%) of its
reproduction value a nonconforming building may be repaired or reconstructed
and used as before the time of damage, provided such repairs or reconstruction
are completed within one year from the date of the damage.
   (e)   A nonconforming use in violation of the provisions of the previous
Zoning Ordinance which this Zoning Code replaces shall not be validated by the
adoption of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Any nonconforming structure that is ready for or is under construction
when this Zoning Code is adopted or amended may be completed and occupied in
accordance with the requirements of the valid building permit that was
previously issued therefor.
   (g)   A nonconforming front porch may be enclosed. When such porch is nearer
to the street than the building or porch located on either side, the porch
enclosure shall be considered temporary. Temporary porches shall not be
enclosed with siding or other material except glass, windows and screening, and
framing above the existing height of railing.
(1980 Code 153.146)
1153.02 NONCONFORMING LAND.
   A nonconforming use of land existing at the effective date of this Zoning
Code may be continued, provided that no such nonconforming use of land shall be
in any way expanded or extended, either on the same or adjoining property. If
such nonconforming use of land or any portion thereof is discontinued for a
continuous period of one year, any future use of such land shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
(1980 Code 153.146)
1153.03 CONFLICT.
   In the event that the provisions set forth for a specific zoning district
are in conflict with the provisions set forth in Chapter

building or land is located shall prevail.

         (6)    The sign shall be hung at least six inches and not more than
two feet from the wall.

to the window glass. Applied lettering does not significantly block the view
into or out of the storefront.
         (2)    Applied lettering should be done with a light color. Most
storefront interiors appear dark during the day. This makes them an effective
background for letters in pale shades or gold leaf. If the store interior is

signboards hung from inside the window frame.

sign for a new business. Such a sign shall go through the review process and
shall not remain in place more than 30 days unless a variance is requested and
granted.
      (d)    Temporary Window Signs Advertising. Temporary signs in windows are
discouraged. They give the storefront a cluttered and distracting appearance.
Temporary window signs such as "Sale", "Clearance", or graphic signs such as
red hearts for Valentine's Day may be placed without a permit under the
following conditions:
         (1)    No such sign shall exceed 25% of the window area available, or
six square feet, whichever is greater.
         (2)   No such sign shall remain in place more than 30 days.
      (e)    Wall Signs. A wall sign is a sign erected parallel to the surface
of the outside wall of any building. The following apply to wall signs:
         (1)    An attached wall sign shall not be mounted more than one foot
from the building.
         (2)    A wall sign shall not extend above the roofline or beyond the
wall to which the sign is affixed.
         (3)    No wall sign shall cover or obscure wall openings or
architectural details of the building.
         (4)    The overall surface of the sign shall not exceed more than two
square feet for every one foot of building width on the wall where the sign is
displayed.
         (5)    All attached wall signs shall be safely and securely anchored
to the building without damaging brick or mortar. In no case may a wall sign be
secured with wire, strips of wood, or nails.
            (Ord. 2016-82. Passed 6-20-16.)

awning valance. They should not extend beyond the ends of the awning or above
or below the valance.
      (i)    Graphics included in the awning sign may not exceed 10 inches in
height.
   9.    Ground Signs. Ground Signs are not permitted in the National Register
Area of Bridge Street. They may be permitted on other commercial property in
the Harbor Historical District with a special use permit. They will be

criteria as other signs in the District and be in scale with their proposed
surroundings. There shall be a clear and defined need for this type of sign

1177.01 STANDARDS ARE MINIMUM.
   The standards and details of design prescribed herein are intended only as
the minimum requirements so that the general arrangement and layout of a
subdivision may be adjusted to a wide variety of circumstances. However, in the
design and development of the plat, the subdivider should use standards
consistent with the site conditions to assure an economical, pleasant and
durable neighborhood.
(1980 Code 152.15)
1177.02 RELATION TO ADJOINING STREET SYSTEM; STREET NAMES.
   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provision for the
continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas, or their proper
projection where adjoining land is not subdivided, insofar as they may be
deemed necessary for public requirements. The width of streets on new
subdivisions shall not be less than the minimum widths established herein. The
street and alley arrangements shall not cause hardship to owners of adjoining
property in platting their own land and providing convenient access to it.
Offset streets shall be avoided. The angle of intersection between minor
streets and major streets shall not vary by more than ten degrees from a right
angle. Streets obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the
names of the existing streets. Proposed street names that are in conflict with
existing street names shall not be approved. (1980 Code 152.16)
1177.03 STREET AND ALLEY WIDTHS AND LOCATIONS.
   (a)   The widths and locations of major streets shall conform to the widths
and locations designated on the major street plan.
   (b)   The minimum width for minor streets shall be fifty feet. In cases
where the topography or special conditions make a street of less width more
suitable, the Planning Commission may waive the above requirements. When a
street adjoins unsubdivided property, a half-street at least thirty feet in
width shall be dedicated, and whenever the property being subdivided adjoins a
half-street, the remainder of the street shall be dedicated.
   (c)   Alleys shall not be provided in a residential block. Alleys are
required in the rear of all business lots, unless other adequate provisions are
made for service and deliveries, and shall be at least twenty feet wide.
(1980 Code 152.17)
1177.04 EASEMENTS.
   Easements of at least five feet in width shall be dedicated on each side of
all rear lot lines and along side lot lines, where necessary, for poles, wires,
conduits, storm and sanitary sewers, gas, water or other utilities. Easements
of greater width may be required along or across lots where necessary for the
extension of main sewers or other utilities, or where both water and sewer
lines are located in the same easement.
(1980 Code 152.18.)
1177.05 BLOCKS; COURTS AND DEAD-END STREETS.
   (a)   No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet. Where blocks are over 750
feet in length, a crosswalk with a right-of-way of at least ten feet in width
may be required near the center of the block.
   (b)   Courts, dead-end streets or other street space may be provided if
proper access is given to all lots from a dedicated street or court. All dead-
end streets shall terminate in a dedicated street space having a minimum radius
of fifty feet, or other satisfactory means for turning of vehicle. Dead-end
streets shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length.
(1980 Code 152.19)
1177.06 LOTS.
   (a)   Arrangement and Design. The lot arrangement and design shall be such
that all lots shall provide satisfactory and desirable building sites properly
related to topography and to the character of surrounding development.
   (b)   Side Lines. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to
straight street lines and radial to curved street lines, except where a
variation of this rule will provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with
double frontage shall be avoided.
   (c)   Corner Lots.  Corner lots shall have a width sufficient to permit the
establishment of front building lines on both the adjoining streets.
   (d)   Lots at Major and Acute Angle Intersections. Lots at major street
intersections and at acute angle intersections of less than eighty-five degrees
shall have a radius of twenty feet at the street corner. On business lots a
chord may be substituted for the circular arc.
   (e)   Lot Dimensions.
      (1)   No lot shall have an area or width less than the maximum required
for the R-1 District regardless of existing zoning.
      (2)   In any subdivision where neither a public sewer nor a public water
supply is available, no lot shall have an area of less than 20,000 square feet
or a width of less than 125 feet measured at the building line. Where a public
water supply is available, but individual sewage disposal devices are used, no
lot shall have an area of less than 12,000 square feet or a width of less than
100 feet.
         (1980 Code 152.20; Ord. 6769)
1177.07 MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS.
   Where a subdivision outside the corporate limits contains sewers, sewage
treatment plants, water supply systems, park areas or other physical facilities
necessary or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use
or benefit and which the City or County does not desire to or cannot maintain,
provision shall be made, by trust agreements made a part of the deed
restrictions acceptable to the City, for the proper and continuous maintenance
and supervision of the facilities by the lot owners in the subdivision.
(1980 Code 152.21)
1177.08 PARKS AND SCHOOL SITES.
   Where an area being subdivided includes lands proposed to be used for parks
or schools, under the duly adopted official comprehensive plan of the City and
its environs, the subdivider shall not plat such lands as a part of the
subdivision plat, and shall confer with the appropriate public agency regarding
the time, method and amount of payment for the agency to acquire the land. If
no agreement has been reached upon the acquisition of the area within two years
from the date of the submission of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may
then plat the balance of the area.
(1980 Code 152.22)
1177.09 EASEMENTS ALONG STREAMS.
   Whenever any stream or important surface drainage course is located in any
area which is being subdivided, the subdivider shall provide an adequate
easement, as determined by the City Engineer, along each side of the stream for
the purpose of widening, deepening, sloping, improving or protecting the
stream. The easement shall be dedicated to the City or other appropriate public
agency.
(1980 Code 152.23).
1177.10 EXCEPTIONS IN NEIGHBORHOOD UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Whenever a subdivision is developed as a modern neighborhood unit where
adequate park area is provided, through traffic is adequately cared for, and
the majority of the minor streets are of cul-de-sacs, the Planning Commission
may vary the requirements of Sections
1177.03 through
1177.06 to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of the streets
and lots, but at the same time protect the convenience, health and safety of
the future residents of the subdivision as well as the general welfare of the
City. In no case, however, shall the lot area per family requirement be less
than is required in any zoning regulations.
(1980 Code 152.24)
1177.11 PROTECTION OF FLOODPLAINS.
   Where any subdivision is located in an area subject to periodic floods, the
Planning Commission shall not approve the plat. Where the subdivision is
located in an area having poor drainage or other physical impairment, the
Commission may approve the subdivision, provided the developer or subdivider
agrees to perform improvements that shall render the area safe and satisfactory
for use.
(1980 Code 152.25)
1177.12 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF WAY REGULATIONS.
   All rights-of-way within any subdivision are subject to, and shall be in
accordance with, all applicable regulations and requirements set forth in the
Codified Ordinances of Ashtabula,

1187.04 PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING HISTORIC DISTRICTS OR LANDMARKS.
   To consider the establishment of a historic district or landmark, the
following procedure shall be followed:
   (a)   The initiation of a proposal for a historic district shall be made
only by a property owner(s) in the proposed district area. Property owner(s) of
the proposed district shall present to the AHPC a petition, expressing their
desire to be declared a historic district, which shall specify the
characteristics of the district that uniquely define it as historic. The
boundaries of the proposed district shall be specified. The petition shall be
signed by not less than fifty-one percent (51%) of the owners of the properties
to be included in the district and shall include verification of such
requirements with reference to the Ashtabula County Auditor's real property
records. For purposes of this Section, an owner is defined as the person or
entity holding title to one or more parcels of land within the proposed
district, and each owner shall have one "vote" regardless of how many parcels
within the proposed district are owned by that person or entity.
   (b)   The initiation of a proposal for a landmark shall be made only by the
landmark property owner(s). Said property owner(s) shall submit the proposal
for landmark status to the AHPC, and such proposal shall specify the
characteristics of the property that uniquely define it as historic.
   (c)   The AHPC shall consider the proposal in terms of the criteria provided
in Section
1187.03. After review, the AHPC shall forward the proposal with its
recommendation along with the owners' written comments to the City Council.
   (d)   Upon receipt of the AHPC's recommendation, the City Council shall
cause an appropriate ordinance to be prepared stating the reason for the
designation of a landmark or the establishment of a historic district. A public
hearing shall be scheduled on the proposed legislation. Notice of the public
hearing shall be given by Council in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the City. Said notice shall be published at least ten (10) days
before the date of the required hearing. The published notice shall include the
time and place of the public hearing, a summary of the proposal and a statement
that opportunity to be heard will be afforded to any person interested. If the
proposal involves an historic district often (10) or less parcels of land, as
listed on the tax duplicate, at least ten (10) days before the day of the
public hearing written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the Clerk of
Council to all owners of property located within 300 feet of the proposed
district, directed to the addresses of such owners appearing on the County
Auditor's current tax list. The notice shall contain the same information as
required of notices published in newspapers as specified above.
   (e)   Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the AHPC and to the public hearing comments and shall make a
final determination. City Council may:
      (1)   Approve the proposal as requested and designate the landmark or
district as a historic property. Approval shall require the vote of art least
five (5) Councilors if a proposal previously has been denied by the AHPC.
      (2)   Deny the proposal.
   (f)   After a decision by City Council, the Clerk of Council shall notify
all persons known to have a legal or equitable interest in said property. The
Division of Planning & Community Development (hereafter "PCD") and the
Chairperson of the AHPC shall also be notified.
   (g)   The City Manager or PCD shall notify any appropriate county, State or
Federal offices after a designation is approved. The City Solicitor shall cause
to be recorded in the office of the Ashtabula County Recorder a certified copy
of each ordinance designating a preservation district or landmark.
   (h)   No legislation under this section shall be rendered invalid by any
failure or alleged failure to provide a prescribed notice by mail or otherwise
by person.
   (I)   Designation of a historic district or landmark shall be considered a
district overlay with the regulations of the underlying zoning district
remaining in effect for any property designated as a landmark or included in a
historic district.
   (j)   Following the designation of the landmark property, the AHPC may place
or cause to be placed on such landmark an official City plaque, indicating that
such property or part thereof has been designated a landmark in the City. In
case of designation of a district, the AHPC may place or cause to be placed
official City plaques at appropriate location(s) near all entranceways to the
new district. The design and location of such plaques shall be within the sound
discretion of the AHPC, subject to approval by a majority of Council. Said
plaques shall be and remain the property of the City.
      (Ord. 2019-91. Passed 8-5-19.)
1187.05 CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   A certificate of appropriateness (hereafter "COA”) is required for
exterior alterations or additions to the exterior of any building or structure
designated as an historic landmark or located within an historic district, for
the construction of a new building or structure within an historic district, or
for the demolition of an existing building or structure designated as an
historic landmark or located within an historic district.
   (b)   Zoning permit applications for changes within designated historic
districts or to historic landmarks shall be deemed to be applications for
certificates of appropriateness. The PCD shall forward these applications to
the AHPC chairperson.
   (c)   Application procedures.
      (1)   Informal review: Applicants are encouraged to read the guidelines
to become familiar with design review for historic buildings and structures.
Applicants are encouraged to discuss a project and certificate of
appropriateness with the AHPC prior to submitting an application. The AHPC may
provide a list of resources which may guide an applicant in preparing a formal
submission. Applicants may request an informal review with the AHPC prior to a
formal submission.
      (2)   Submission requirements: The applicant shall submit an application
for a COA along with supporting documents as specified herein to the City
Division of Planning and Community Development (PCD). The supporting documents
shall include drawings, photographs, specifications, and material samples. The
submission must accurately represent the proposed alterations, additions and/or
new construction. PCD staff will forward copies to each of the AHPC members,
for consideration at the next regular meeting of the AHPC.
   (d)   The AHPC shall make a determination on a COA within sixty (60) days of
the filing of the application unless the applicant approves an extension of
time. The AHPC may table the application for additional information or
clarification for a period not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days. If the
AHPC fails to render its decision within the specified time period the COA
shall be deemed approved.
   (e)   In making such a determination the AHPC shall refer to the Secretary
of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and to guidelines adopted by the
AHPC.
   (f)   The AHPC shall approve or approve with conditions the COA upon finding
that:
      (1)   The proposal conforms to the guidelines; or
      (2)   There is no feasible and prudent alternative alteration or change
which would conform to the guidelines, and adhering to the guidelines would
deny the owner any commercially viable use of the real property.
   (g)   If a COA is approved, permits relative to the proposed changes may be
issued immediately following normal zoning and building department review
procedures.
   (h)   If a COA is denied, the City shall not issue any permits that would
allow modifications for which the COA was denied. In cases where a COA has been
disapproved the AHPC shall state the reasons for such disapproval in writing
and transmit the written statement to the applicant together with any
recommendation the AHPC may have made for appropriate changes. The AHPC shall
make every effort to work with the applicant for a period not to exceed sixty
(60) days after a disapproval to develop a proposal that will be compatible
with the terms of this chapter so as to permit a COA to be issued.
   (I)   In the case of a denial of a COA for demolition:
      (1)   The AHPC and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion to find a means of preserving the property.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the AHPC in good faith and at
specified times, then denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   After meeting with the applicant, if the AHPC determines that
denial would create a substantial hardship to the applicant, it shall propose a
compromise which relieves the hardship, if it exists.
      (4)   If, after meeting with the applicant, the AHPC has not reached a
compromise with the applicant that relieves substantial hardship, then the
applicant may appeal the decision, within thirty (30) days of the said meeting,
directly to the City Council. Council may affirm, modify or reverse the AHPC's
decision.
      (5)   In the specific cases of demolition, the AHPC may delay a decision
for up to 180 days upon finding that a structure is of such importance that
alternatives to demolition should be actively pursued by both the AHPC and the
applicant. Alternate steps to be investigated include, but are not limited to:
         A.   Consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested
citizens;
         B.   Recommendations for acquisition of the property by public or
private bodies;
         C.   Exploration of the possibility of moving one or more structures
or other features.
   (j)   Notice of the decision of the AHPC regarding any application shall be
mailed by the AHPC Secretary to the applicant by ordinary U.S. Mail within ten
(10) days after the decision date.
   (k)   At any time prior to completion of work under a COA an applicant may
apply for an amendment to the certificate. An applicant must apply for an
amendment if the design for which the certificate was issued is altered.

approved as submitted. The applicant, or any other person or entity, or any
officer, board or department of the City of Ashtabula, aggrieved by the
decision of the AHPC may appeal the decision of the AHPC to Council by filing a
notice of appeal with the Clerk of Council not later than twenty (20) days
after the AHPC renders its decision. Council shall consider the appeal at its
next regular meeting that is not less than fourteen (14) days after the notice
of appeal is filed. In the event of an appeal, Council may affirm, modify or
reverse the decision of the AHPC.
(Ord. 2019-91. Passed 8-5-19.)
1187.10 DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS/DEMOLITION CRITERIA.
   (a)   These guidelines are meant to give architects and property owners
design direction consistent with Chapter
1187 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Ashtabula. In principle, the
board adopts the United States of America, Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties (Appendix A).
   (b)   Preservation/rehabilitation. With respect to preservation/
rehabilitation generally it is the interest of the board that buildings within
historic districts be preserved, thus maintaining the character of the
district. Consistent with the United States Secretary of the Interior,
Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, the intent of these
guidelines is to preserve and restore the features which establish a building's
architectural character while making alterations and renovations necessary for
the efficient and contemporary use of the building. The rehabilitation process
assumes that some alterations may be necessary to meet the needs of the
building owner and the health, safety, and welfare of the building occupants.
Such alterations should be done so as not to destroy the materials and features
which help to define a building's historic, cultural, and/or architectural
character.
   (c)   The historic materials, features, and/or craftsmanship are important
in defining the building character and should be retained, protected, and
repaired when possible. When the preservation of architectural features is not
possible, alterations should be done in a manner respecHhl of the existing
character, but done in a manner that is representative of architectural design
and construction of contemporary times.
   (d)   Additions/new constructions. With respect to additions/new
construction to existing buildings and all new buildings or structures within
historic districts, it is generally the interest of the board that such
additions/new construction shall be designed to enhance the character of the
district. New buildings and additions should be representative of architectural
design and construction of contemporary times.
   (e)   Additions to existing buildings in a historic district should be
designed so as not to detract from the original character of the building.
Whenever possible, additions should be located away from primary or street face
of the building. The addition should be designed so as not to destroy existing
architectural features, such that the addition can be removed and the building
restored to its original condition.
   (f)   New buildings in a historic district shall be designated to be
compatible with the other structures in the district while still reflecting
work of contemporary times. Proximity of existing buildings to the new building
will affect the latitude in design constraints. An infill design should be more
consistent with adjoining buildings than a freestanding structure.
   (g)   Demolition. With respect to demolition, it is the interest of the
board that landmark buildings and buildings within historic districts be
preserved and renovated for economically productive uses. The board encourages
the saving and adaptive reuse of buildings significant to the character of the
historic districts and the history of the City of Ashtabula. Consistent with
this intent, the board also realizes that the historic district is not a static
environment, but an ever changing and developing entity. Applications for
demolition shall be reviewed based on the overall impact the demolition will
have on adjacent historic landmarks, historic districts, and the community.
   (h)   In reviewing an application, the AHPC will also consider the impact of
the proposed use of the site on the historic district. Demolition of existing
buildings which are not a significant loss to a historic district to allow for
the construction of new development which enhances the historic district may be
acceptable.
Appendix A
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties
Standards for Preservation
l.    A property will be used as it was historically. or be given a new use
that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials, features, spaces, and
spatial relationships. Where a treatment and use have not been identified, a
property will be protected and, if necessary, stabilized until additional work
may be undertaken.
2.   The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The
replacement of intact or repairable historic materials or alteration of
features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will
be avoided.
3.   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place,
and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate, and conserve existing historic
materials and features will be physically and visually compatible, identifiable
upon close inspection, and properly documented for future research.
4   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own
right will be retained and preserved.
5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
6.   The existing condition of historic features will be evaluated to determine
the appropriate level of intervention needed. Where the severity of
deterioration requires repair or limited replacement of a distinctive feature,
the new material will match the old in composition, design, color, and texture.
7.   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials
will not be used.
8.   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken. http://
ww,v.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-preservation.htm
Standards for Rehabilitation
1.   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that
requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features, spaces, and
spatial relationships.
2.   The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The
removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces. and spatial
relationships that characterize a property will be avoided.
3.   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place,
and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as
adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will
not be undertaken.
4.   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their
own right will be retained and preserved.
5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved.
6.   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and,
where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
7.   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials
will not be used.
8.   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken.
9.   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not
destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and
will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and
proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
10.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken
in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
http://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-rehabilitation.htm
Standards for Restoration
1.   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use which
reflects the property's restoration period.
2.   Materials and features from the restoration period will be retained and
preserved. The removal of materials or alteration of features, spaces, and
spatial relationships that characterize the period will not be undertaken.
3.   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place,
and use. Work needed to stabilize, consolidate and conserve materials and
features from the restoration period will be physically and visually
compatible, identifiable upon close inspection, and properly documented for
future research.
4.   Materials, features, spaces, and finishes that characterize other
historical periods will be documented prior to their alteration or removal.
5.   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize the restoration period will be
preserved.
6.   Deteriorated features from the restoration period will be repaired rather
than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color,
texture, and, where possible, materials.
7.   Replacement of missing features from the restoration period will be
substantiated by documentary and physical evidence. A false sense of history
will not be created by adding conjectural features, features from other
properties, or by combining features that never existed together historically.
8.   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using
the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials
will not be used.
9.   Archeological resources affected by a project will be protected and
preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures
will be undertaken.
10.   Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.
http://www.nps.gov/tps/standards/four-treatments/treatment-reconstruction.htm
Standards for Reconstruction
1.   Reconstruction will be used to depict vanished or non-surviving portions
of a property when documentary and physical evidence is available to permit
accurate reconstruction with minimal conjecture, and such reconstruction is
essential to the public understanding of the property.
2.   Reconstruction of a landscape, building, structure, or object in its
historic location will be preceded by a thorough archeological investigation to
identify and evaluate those features and artifacts which are essential to an
accurate reconstruction. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures will be undertaken.
3.   Reconstruction will include measures to preserve any remaining historic
materials, features, and spatial relationships.
4.   Reconstruction will be based on the accurate duplication of historic
features and elements substantiated by documentary or physical evidence rather
than on conjectural designs or the availability of different features from
other historic properties. A reconstructed property will re-create the
appearance of the non-surviving historic property in materials, design, color,
and texture.
5.   A reconstruction will be clearly identified as a contemporary recreation.
6.   Designs that were never executed historically will not be constructed.

are specifically intended to impose strict liability, and shall be chargeable
with Violation of Historic District Regulations, a minor misdemeanor criminal
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues. Whoever violates this
section shall be required to restore and reconstruct such features in full
detail. Restoration or reconstruction shall be in addition to any criminal
penalty and not in lieu thereof.
   (c)   Whoever receives a COA from the AHPC and constructs, reconstructs, or
alters any exterior architectural feature or demolishes a part or all of any
building or accessory structure within the historic district or any historic
landmark other than in accordance with the requirements of the COA shall be
deemed to be in violation of this section, the provisions of which are
specifically intended to impose strict liability, and shall be chargeable with

duly authorized agent shall determine the acceptability of all plans and
specifications.

   (d)   No person shall erase, alter or modify any lines, figures or markings
contained upon drawings so stamped by the Building Inspector or filed with him
for reference. If, during the process of the execution of work, it is desired

shall be given to the Building Inspector and his consent shall be obtained.
Deviations which do not involve any change in structural parts, stairways,
elevators, fire escapes or other means of communication, ingress or egress, or
lighting or ventilating, and which are not in violation of any ordinance or
law, may be made without the permission of the Building Inspector.
   (e)   All approvals of applications, plans, and specifications, and
amendments thereto, shall expire by limitation six months from the date of the
original approval of plans and specifications. However, this expiration
limitation shall not apply to the erection of any buildings under approved
plans and specifications, when work thereunder has been begun and carried on
with reasonable continuity within six months from the original approval, or
when the work to be performed is lawful and can be carried on without violating
any provision of any law or City ordinance.

1333.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Ashtabula, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Ashtabula has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:   
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
       (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Ashtabula as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Ashtabula.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Ashtabula County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas effective August 28, 2019 Flood Insurance Study for
Ashtabula County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas effective August 28, 2019.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Ashtabula as required by Section
1333.04(c). Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at 4717 Main Avenue, Ashtabula, OH.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (I)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Ashtabula, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (p)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on
sloping terrain); average depths are determined.

in any given year; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base
flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   ZoneA99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
to be protected from the 100- year flood by a Federal flood protection system
under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
       (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject

   (q)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (r)   Floodproofing. Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (s)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus two [2] feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (t)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (u)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
    (v)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Ashtabula's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (w)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (x)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (y)   Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA). A line shown on a Flood
Insurance Rate Map to indicate the inland limit of the 1.5-ft breaking wave
height during the base flood.
   (z)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (aa)    Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (bb)    Mean sea level. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   (cc)    Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-
01 (K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home park does not
include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display for sale of
manufactured homes.
   (dd)    Moderate Wave Action Area (MoWA). A special flood hazard area
subject to the potential for breaking wave heights of greater than or equal to
1.5 feet, but less than 3 feet, where the primary source of flooding is storm
surges, seiches. A MoWA is an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is between the
inland limit of zone VE and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where identified.
(Also known as "Coastal A Zone").
   (ee)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (ff)    New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
Ashtabula and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [February 1, 1980] and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (gg)    Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev.
Code §111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is
not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (hh)    Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (ii)    Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
   (jj)    Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4733.
   (kk)    Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 4733.
   (ll)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas
may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (mm)    Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (nn)    Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (oo)    Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (pp)    Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (qq)    Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   (rr)    Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

      (3)   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the potential
effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that its planning
programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies
and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Ashtabula flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1333.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
             i.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            ii.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            iii.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            iv.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1333.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (k)(1)A., prepared in a format required
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            i.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            ii.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
Ashtabula, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in wntmg whenever the boundaries of the City of
Ashtabula have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Ashtabula's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Ashtabula boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Ashtabula suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Ashtabula has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1333.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, and Vl-30:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            i.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            ii.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
          B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1333.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, or Vl-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            i.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            ii.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Ashtabula specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1333.03(j)(1)A.3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate ofrise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
            Variances shall only be issued upon:
            i.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            ii.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            iii.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
             iv.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            v.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d) have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 2506. (Ord. 2019-102. Passed 8-19-19.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit

   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed

misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as

collection as and with taxes.

plan which includes amounts previously certified, and the City Finance Director

payments received.

collection authorities for delinquent taxes is an acceptable payment plan under
this Section.
      (5)    The Director may, with the approval of the City Manager, take the
enforcement action described in this paragraph (e) as to all properties within
the City of Ashtabula which are used as rentals by an owner of multiple
properties, one or more of which has incurred delinquent fees as described
herein.

financial interest. Three members of the Board in attendance at any meeting
shall constitute a quorum.
   (c)    Interpretation; Granting Variances. The Board shall interpret the
intent of the Housing Code in specific cases where, upon appeal, it clearly
appears that by reason of special conditions, undue hardship would result from
literal application of any section thereof. Where undue hardship is clearly
demonstrated, the Board may permit a variance from the applicable section,
provided the dwelling shall vary only a reasonable minimum from the literal
provision of the Housing Code and shall comply generally with the spirit and
intent of the regulations as to sanitation, safety, and rehabilitation. Any
variance shall be permitted only by the concurring vote of at least three
members of the Board.
(Ord. 2011-111. Passed 7-5-11.)

offered for rent or lease shall be subject to reasonable inspection at
reasonable times, with prior notice, by the Housing Division of the City in

condition which is compliant with the standards set forth in this Section. Only
one (1) such inspection per year may be performed, unless a dwelling unit is
found to be substantially non-compliant with such standards, in which event
additional inspections as set forth herein shall be permitted. In the

inspection of a dwelling unit other than a vacant dwelling unit subject to
paragraph (e), below, has been performed within the previous thirty-six
(36)   months and the dwelling unit involved was found to be in substantial
compliance with the standards of this Section, then the owner of such unit may
supply the Director with a written statement verifying there has been no
material change in the condition of the unit since such inspection, and pay a
continuation fee as set forth below in lieu of an annual inspection.
      (1)   No person shall rent or lease, or materially assist or participate
as an agent in renting or leasing any real property located within the City

certificate and paying all required fees as set forth herein. In addition to
any other penalty or enforcement action, the Director of the Division of
Housing is authorized to assess a $250.00 civil penalty against any person
found to be in violation of the foregoing prohibition; provided, however, that
no penalty may be assessed against a person solely for refusing to permit an
inspection by an officer or agent of the City without first obtaining a search
warrant.

inspection of the exterior only within thirty (30) days prior to the sale,
transfer, or conveyance thereof, as well being subject to full inspection upon

Division of Housing is authorized to assess a $500.00 civil penalty against any
person found to be in violation of the foregoing prohibition. An inspection of
a dwelling unit that is to be sold, transferred or conveyed must be performed
within 30 days of the date of sale, transfer or conveyance in order to be
effective. If the real property involved has been subject to an inspection
within the previous year and was found to be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of this Chapter, the transfer inspection may be waived by the
Director upon the payment of a $25.00 fee.
      (2)   The parties to a prospective transfer who are unable to perform
repairs which may be required pursuant to such inspection prior to transfer may
enter into an agreement whereby the legal responsibility for bringing a
property into compliance is assumed by the transferor, transferee, or agent of
either, as long as such agreement provides for the required repairs to be done
within a definite and reasonable time agreed to by the Housing Division, and
provides that the City of Ashtabula shall have standing to enforce said
agreement by legal action if the required repairs are not completed within said
reasonable time. When such an agreement is presented to and approved by the
Director, he shall issue a conditional certificate of occupancy incorporating
the requirement that such repairs be performed within the time agreed upon. The
certificate shall be deemed to be revoked if the conditions are not met.

secured against occupation by order of any public body or agency, shall be
registered with the Housing Division on a form approved by the City Manager and
shall be inspected annually.
   (f)   Properties Inspected by Other Agencies. Dwellings or dwelling units
which are or have been inspected for habitability standards by another
governmental agency, such as the Ashtabula Metropolitan Housing Authority, and
have passed such inspection, are not subject to a further inspection by the

safety and economic impacts of structures which remain vacant for long periods
of time, including but not limited to administrative costs for registering and
processing the vacant building owner registration form and for the costs
incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The fees are also
structured in order to provide appropriate incentives for owners of vacant
buildings to care for them properly, seek to fill them, and in appropriate

four hundred dollars ($400.00) for the first year the building remain vacant.

fee equaling the five-year fee of six thousand four hundred dollars ($6,400) to
be used for the fifth and for all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (c)    The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the owner successfully restores the building to occupancy or
demolishes it in accordance with applicable law during the first year following
registration, the fee shall be refunded, less an administrative charge equal to
5% of the amount refunded. In each subsequent year, if the registration is
renewed in timely fashion, there have been no violations associated with the
property in the previous year, and re-inspection reveals no significant
housing, building or fire code violations, one-half of the previous year’s
registration fee shall be refunded to the owner, less an administrative charge
equal to 5% of the amount refunded.
   (d)    The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption.
   (e)    All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer
of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed on the
property to collect delinquent fees.
   (f)    Absent a showing of good cause, if a building is not registered
within the time frame required in Section
1369.02 , or the registration is not renewed within 30 days after the
expiration of one year from the date of the previous registration, a penalty
shall be paid in addition to the annual registration fee. The penalty shall be
equal to one-half of the current annual fee or one thousand dollars ($1,000),
whichever is less.

reoccupy the building in an expedient manner, or the intent to demolish the
building. One extension of not more than 90 days’ duration may be granted for
good cause shown.
   (c)    A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of Ohio
