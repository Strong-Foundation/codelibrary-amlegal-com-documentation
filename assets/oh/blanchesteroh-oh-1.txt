legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(R.C. § 1.42)

      (3)   Words in the present tense include the future tense.
(R.C. § 1.43)
   (C)   Calendar; computation of time.
      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   As used in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this section, LEGAL

(R.C. § 1.14)
      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, the priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding

construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.

or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving that
authority to a majority of the officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority, or it is
inconsistent with state law or municipal charter provisions.
   (G)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
contains any express provision excluding the construction, or when the subject
matter or context of the law is repugnant thereto.
§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal; or
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, the reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions, or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.
(R.C. § 1.23)
   (C)   A reference to any portion of a provision of this code applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(R.C. § 1.55)
   (D)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)
   (E)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of the error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language may be used by the municipality to amend, add,
or repeal a chapter, section, or division:
      (1)   To amend a section: “Section                 of the Blanchester
Municipal Code of Ordinances is amended to read as follows: ....”

Municipal Code of Ordinances, which is to be added to and amends the
Blanchester Municipal Code of Ordinances, reads as follows: ....”
      (3)   To repeal a section: “Section                 of the Blanchester
Municipal Code of Ordinances, which reads as follows, is repealed: ....”
§ 10.16 STATUTORY REFERENCES.
   (A)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, located in parentheses
immediately following a division or section of this code, this indicates that
the text of the division or section is substantially equivalent to the
statutory provision.
Example: (R.C. § 4511.02)

the text of a section, this indicates that the reader should refer to that
statute for further information.

§ 10.17 PRESERVATION OF PENALTIES, OFFENSES, RIGHTS, AND LIABILITIES.
   All offenses committed under laws in force prior to the effective date of
this code shall be prosecuted and remain punishable as provided by those laws.
This code does not affect any rights or liabilities accrued, penalties
incurred, or proceedings begun prior to the effective date of this code. The
liabilities, proceedings, and rights are continued; punishments, penalties, or
forfeitures shall be enforced and imposed as if this code had not been enacted.
In particular, any agreement granting permission to utilize highway rights-of-
way, contracts entered into, or franchises granted, the acceptance,
establishment, or vacation of any highway, and the election of corporate
officers shall remain valid in all respects, as if this code had not been
enacted.

of the Legislative Authority, may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction; and
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 33.01 PERSONNEL POLICY.
   The personnel policy for employees of the village is hereby adopted. A full
copy of the policy can be found in the Fiscal Officer’s Office.
(Res. 2023.014, passed 9-14-2023; Ord. 2024.024, passed 12-30-2024)
§ 33.02 VACATION POLICY.
   (A)   Employees are entitled to paid vacation time once eligible. Regular
full-time employees are eligible to earn and use vacation time as described in
this section. Vacation time is earned and accrued on the second pay period of
each calendar month of employment.   
   (B)   An employee's vacation pay will be at his or her current regular
straight base rate of pay. Vacation pay will be available at the scheduled pay
period. Vacation accumulation for full-time employees shall be as follows:  
 
Years of Employment Maximum Annual Earnings
1 - 7 years         80 hours
8 - 13 years        120 hours
14 - 22 years       160 hours
23+ years           200 hours
 
      (1)   All full-time employees who have been with the village for less
than eight full calendar years of continuous employment earn 6.67 hours of
vacation on the second pay period of each full calendar month of employment.
For employees who are employed on January 1 of any given year, this amounts to
80 hours vacation to use throughout the year. In an employee s first year of
employment, the total entitlement for that first year will depend on the number
of full calendar months of employment.  
      (2)   Full-time employees who have been with the village eight to 13 full
calendar years of continuous employment as of January 1 will earn ten hours of
vacation on the second pay period of each full calendar month for a total of
120 hours vacation to use throughout the year.  
      (3)   Full-time employees who have been with the village 14 to 22 full
calendar years of continuous employment as of January 1 will earn 13.33 hours
of vacation on the second pay period of each full calendar month for a total of
160 hours vacation to use throughout the year.  
      (4)   Full-time employees who have been with the village 23 or more full
calendar years of continuous employment as of January 1 will earn 16.66 hours
of vacation on the second pay period of each full calendar month for a total of
200 hours vacation to use throughout the year.  
   (C)   For computing maximum annual earnings of vacation hours for full-time
employees, years of "employment shall include years of full.
   (D)   The scheduling of vacation usage shall be at the discretion of the
department supervisor and shall be posted in writing. An employee may begin to
request use of their vacation time after their probationary period. (This may
be waived by the Mayor or Board of Public Affairs chairperson for employees
hired during the last quarter of the year and in rare or extreme
circumstances.) Employees may schedule vacation in one-hour increments at the
discretion of their supervisor. Vacation requests to extend holidays are at the
discretion of the supervisor.  
   (E)   To schedule vacation time, employees must submit a vacation request to
their immediate supervisor via email or in writing. At least 24 hours advance
notice is required for up to eight hours of vacation. Vacation request for more
than eight hours should be made at least four weeks in advance unless it is an
absolute emergency.  
   (F)   Employees hired prior to November 10, 2016 can accumulate vacation for
one year and taken within the following year. Vacation will be accumulated as
set in division (B) of this section. Vacation can be accumulated for no more
than two years. (Example: a person with 15 years of service who does not take
any vacation during the year could accumulate 160 hours. That 160 hours can
then be carried over into the next year to be used in whole or a portion of it
could be used. Any vacation not used within the following two years of which it
is earned would be lost. Therefore, 320 hours of vacation time would be the
maximum the employee could accumulate.)  
   (G)   Vacation time is given to employees as a benefit. It is the intent
that employees should be encouraged to use their vacation. Taking time away
from the job will improve morale and allow the employee time with their
families and friends. It should not be intended as a tool for accumulating time
toward retirement.  
   (H)   Employees hired after November 10, 2016 will accumulate vacation as
set in division (B) of this section. Employees who do not use all of their
accumulated vacation time as of December 31 of any year in which it was
accumulated will lose the unused vacation balance. However, an employee may
carry over 40 hours of vacation into the following year. Be advised, employees
who carry over any portion of vacation up to a maximum of 40 hours will not
accumulate more than their one-year of vacation maximum at any point. (Example:
a person with 15 years of service can accumulate 160 hours maximum vacation in
a given year. If an employee carries over 40 hours vacation into the following
year, they will only be able to accumulate an additional 120 hours for that
year until the carry over is used.)  
   (I)   If an employee leaves the employment of the village in good standing
without having utilized all vacation which that employee has earned, the
employee shall be compensated in full for any unused portion of vacation time
within 30 days of leaving the employment of the village. If an employee is
terminated for misconduct, that employee could forfeit their eligibility to
receive compensation of any unused vacation. This would be left to the
discretion of the Village Council or Board of Pubic Affairs.  
   (J)   Employees are advised to schedule their vacation time as far in
advance as possible to avoid scheduling conflicts. Employees should avoid
saving vacation days for use at the end of the year unless those days have been
previously approved. Although every effort will be made to honor an employee's
vacation request, there may be times when a requested vacation may not be
possible. Project requirements and employee preference will be considered when
scheduling vacations. An employee s seniority will not be used to resolve
conflicts. Department heads are responsible to get their employees to schedule
their vacations throughout the year. Requests for vacation schedule changes
will be granted only when it does not cause a conflict within a department or
vacations that have already been scheduled.  
§ 33.03 HEALTH INSURANCE.
   (A)   The following employees of the village are eligible to be covered
under the village health insurance plan:  
      (1)   Full-time employees, as defined by §   2.14  of the personnel
policy; and  
      (2)   Other employees, if health insurance is specifically authorized in
the employing resolution.  
   (B)   The position of the public office of Mayor shall be offered health and
life insurance benefits, with the same terms and conditions offered to any
full-time employee.  
§ 33.04 EMPLOYEE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PROGRAM.
   (A)   The village hereby adopts the Employee Deferred Compensation Program,
and shall properly contract with any eligible employee who desires to
participate in the plan. The plan shall be the uniform plan as promulgated by
and as amended from time to time by the Employee Deferred Compensation Board.
 
   (B)   The Board is hereby authorized to administer the plan under the
Program, and to do all things necessary or proper for the administration of the
plan, consistent with the enabling statutes and all the rules and regulations
promulgated by the Board, whether by the Ohio Administrative Code or otherwise,
and consistent with the Program adoption agreement executed by the village.   
   (C)   The Fiscal Officer is hereby appointed the responsible official and is
authorized and directed by the Village Council to execute the Program adoption
agreement.  
§ 33.05 EMPLOYEE APPRECIATION DINNERS.
   (A)   There is hereby established an employee appreciation dinner, excluding
alcoholic beverages, a proper public purpose, the same being a fringe benefit
and inducement for employees to continue in the employ of the village.  
   (B)   Payment for an employee appreciation dinner shall be in an amount not
to exceed $1,000.  
   (C)   In years where there is an inability to hold an employee appreciation
dinner because of any governmental act that prohibits such a dinner from taking
place, the allocated $1,000 shall be reallocated from an employee appreciation
dinner to pay for a Christmas ham for each village employee.  
§ 33.06 EMPLOYEE DIRECT DEPOSIT POLICY.
   (A)   Direct deposition of payroll mandatory. Pursuant to the authority in

      (3)   Written authorization remains in effect. The authorization shall
remain in effect until withdrawn in writing by the public official and/or

      (4)   Failure to authorize direct deposit.  
         (a)   The Fiscal Officer shall cause a public official and/or employee

person s compensation by the financial institution designated by the Fiscal
Officer as part of the administration of such account by said financial
institution.  
         (c)   Failure of an employee to comply with the requirements of this
section by authorizing direct deposit shall also cause the employee to be

(Ord. 2025.004, passed 3-27-2025)
COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE ALCOHOL/DRUG TESTING POLICY
§ 33.20 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter that all employees be free of substance
and alcohol abuse at work. Consequently, the use of illegal drugs by employees
are prohibited. Further, employees who use and/or are under the influence of
alcohol at work shall be deemed to have engaged in prohibited conduct. The
overall goal of this subchapter is to ensure a drug and alcohol free work place
and to reduce accidents, injuries, and fatalities. This subchapter will apply
to all commercial drivers licensed employees.  
§ 33.21 TYPES OF TESTS.
   Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the United States Department of
Transportation (USDOT), the village has implemented six circumstances for drug
and/or alcohol tests: pre-employment, post-accident, random, reasonable
suspicion, return to duty, and follow-up testing.
   (A)   Pre-employment testing.
         (1)   All applicants applying for positions requiring a CDL with the
village must submit to urine drug tests. An applicant is not required to submit
to urine drug tests if the village can verify that the applicant has
participated in a valid drug testing program within the preceding 30 days and
while participating in that program was either tested within the past six
months or participated in a random selection program for the previous 12
months.
         (2)   The village must also verify that no prior employer of the
applicant has records indicating a violation of any USDOT rule pertaining to
controlled substance use.
   (B)   Post-accident tests.  
      (1)   Generally. Drivers who are involved in a reportable accident will
be subject to a drug and alcohol test following the accident whenever:  
         (a)   The accident involved a fatality;   
         (b)   The employee received a citation for a moving traffic violation
arising from the accident;   
         (c)   Any individual involved in the accident had bodily injury
requiring immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or  
         (d)   There was towable damage to any vehicle involved in the
accident.  
      (2)   Driver's responsibility. A driver subject to a post-accident test
must remain available for testing. A driver must submit to an alcohol test
within eight hours following the accident, and shall not consume any alcohol
for eight hours following the accident. Likewise, a driver must submit to a
drug test within 32 hours following the accident. A driver who leaves the scene
before the test is administered or who does not make himself or herself readily
available shall be deemed to have refused to be tested and such refusal shall
be treated as a blood alcohol content of .04 positive test.  
   (C)   Random testing.  
      (1)   The random selection process shall be administered through Adena
for the Police Department employees and Tri-Health for other village employees.
The village will submit all CDL employees to Adena or Tri-Health for a
computerized random selection system. The random selection system provides an
equal chance for each employee to be selected each time random selection
occurs. Random selections shall be spread throughout the year. Adena or Tri-
Health will test a minimum 50% of consortium members in each calendar year for
drug testing purposes, and 25% of the consortium members for alcohol testing.
Random selection, by its very nature, may result in some employees being
selected in successive selections or more than once during a calendar year.
Alternatively, some employees may not be selected during a calendar year.  
      (2)   If an employee is selected at random, for either a drug or alcohol
test, the village will notify the employee. Once notified, the employee must
proceed directly to a collection site and comply with all directions given at
the collection site.  
   (D)   Reasonable suspicion.  
      (1)   Employees will be required to submit to an alcohol and/or a drug
test when a trained supervisor has reasonable suspicion that the employee has
engaged in prohibited conduct as set forth in § 
33.25 . Reasonable suspicion will be based upon observations concerning the
appearance, behavior, speech, or body odor of the employee.  
      (2)   Reasonable suspicion testing is authorized by this section if the
observations are made during, just preceding, or immediately after the work
day. A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a reasonable
suspicion test, and signed by the supervisor who made the observations within
24 hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the drug test are
released, whichever is earlier.  
   (E)   Return to duty testing. Before an employee returns to duty after
engaging in conduct prohibited by this section, the employee shall undergo a
return-to-duty alcohol and/or drug test with a result indicating an alcohol
concentration of less than a blood alcohol content of .02 and/or drug test with
a verified negative result.  
   (F)   Follow-up testing.   
      (1)   Each employee identified as needing assistance in resolving
problems associated with alcohol misuse or drug use shall be subject to
unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug tests following the employee's return
to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be as
directed by the substance abuse professional (SAP) and consist of at least six
tests in the first 12 months following the employee s return to duty. The
employee may be directed to undergo return-to-duty and follow-up testing for
both alcohol and drugs, if the SAP determines that return-to-duty and follow-up
testing for both alcohol and drugs is necessary.  
      (2)   Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the
employee's return to duty. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up
testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if it is
determined that such testing is no longer necessary.  
§  33.22 REFUSAL TO TEST.
   Refusal to submit to a pre-employment drug test will be grounds for refusal
to hire/promote applicants. Refusal to submit to post-accident testing, random
testing, return-to-duty testing, reasonable suspicion testing, or follow-up
testing shall be considered a positive drug test and/or a positive alcohol test
of .04% blood alcohol concentration. Such refusal shall result in disciplinary
action up to and including termination.  
§ 33.23 TESTING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Drug tests.  
      (1)   Drug testing will be performed through urinalysis. Urinalysis will
test for the presence of metabolites of the following controlled substances:  
         (a)   Marijuana;  
         (b)   Cocaine;  
         (c)   Opiates;  
         (d)   Amphetamines; and  
         (e)   Phencyclidine (PCP).  
      (2)   An employee must present a picture identification to Adena or Tri-
Health. Urine specimens will be submitted to a Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) certified laboratory for testing.  
      (3)   All urinalysis tests for drugs will use the split sample method of
collection. The employees urine sample will be split into two specimen bottles.
One will contain the primary specimen and the other the split specimen. The
split specimen will be preserved under a stringent laboratory condition.
Whenever an employee receives notification of a positive drug test, the
employee may request that the split sample be tested in a different DHHS
certified laboratory. This request must be made within 72 hours after the
employee received notification of the positive drug test.  
      (4)   All laboratory results will be reported by the laboratory to the
Medical Review Officer (MRO) designated by the village. Negative test results
shall be reported by the MRO to the village. Before reporting a positive test
result to the village, the MRO will attempt to contact the employee to discuss
the test result. If the MRO is unable to contact the employee directly, the MRO
will contact the village's confidential contact designated in advance by the
village, who shall in turn contact the employee and direct the employee to
contact the MRO immediately. In the MRO s sole discretion, a determination will
be made as to whether a result is positive or negative.  
      (5)   Pursuant to USDOT regulations, individual test results for
applicants and employees will be released to the village and will be kept
strictly confidential unless consent for the release of the test results has
been obtained.  
   (B)   Alcohol tests. An employee must present a picture identification to
Adena or Tri-Health. Alcohol tests will be performed using an evidential breath
testing device. The employee shall follow all instructions given by the breath
alcohol technician. In the event that an employee, on the basis of the
evidential breath test, has a blood alcohol content of .02 to .0399, the
employee shall be removed from duty, without pay, for 24 hours or until their
next scheduled on-duty time, after completion of the 24-hour out-of-service
period, whichever is longer. The employee will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including termination. All alcohol tests shall be performed
just prior to, during, or just after performing safety sensitive functions. An
employee testing blood alcohol content of .02 or above must immediately contact
the village and inform them of the test result. An employee tested with a blood
alcohol content of .02 or above shall not operate a village vehicle.  
 § 33.24 SUBSTANCE ABUSE EVALUATION.
   Any employee who engages in prohibited conduct shall be provided with the
name, address, and telephone number of a substance abuse professional (SAP). If
the employee desires to become re-qualified, the employee must be evaluated by
a SAP and submit to any treatment prescribed by the SAP. Following evaluation
and treatment, in order to become re-qualified, the employee must submit to and
successfully complete a return-to-duty test (see §  
33.21(E)). Such employee is also subject to follow-up testing (see §  
33.21(F)).  
§  33.25 PROHIBITED CONDUCT.
   The following shall be considered prohibitive conduct for purposes of this
subchapter.  
   (A)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty while having an
alcohol concentration of .02 or greater.  
   (B)   No employee shall be on duty or operate a commercial motor vehicle
while the employee possesses alcohol.  
   (C)   No employee shall perform safety-sensitive functions within four hours
after using alcohol.  
   (D)   No employee required to take a post-accident alcohol test shall use
alcohol for eight hours following the accident or until he or she undergoes a
post-accident test, whichever first occurs.  
   (E)   No employee shall refuse to submit to a post-accident, random,
reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up alcohol or drug test.   
   (F)   No employee shall report for duty or remain on duty when the employee
uses any controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the instructions
of a physician who has advised the employee that the substance does not
adversely affect the employee s ability to operate a motor vehicle.  
   (G)   No employee shall use, possess, manufacture, distribute, consume,
sell, or store (including in a desk, locker, motor vehicle, or other
repository) controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, or alcohol on village
property, while conducting village business in supplied vehicles or during
working hours.  
   (H)   No employee shall switch, alter, or commit any misconduct pertaining
to any breath or urine samples.  
   (I)   No employee shall refuse to sign the:  
      (1)   Certificate of receipts;  
      (2)   Substance abuse testing consent form;  
      (3)   Laboratory chain of custody form;  
      (4)   Rehabilitation agreement; or  
      (5)   Post-accident hospital authorization form.  
§ 33.26 SUPERVISORY TRAINING.
   Those supervisors who are responsible for determining reasonable suspicion
shall receive 60 minutes of training on alcohol misuse and 60 minutes of
training on drug use. The training shall include the physical, behavioral,
speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of drugs.
 
§ 33.27 AUTHORIZATION FOR PREVIOUS TEST RESULTS.
   (A)   Federal regulations require that the village obtain certain drug
testing records from potential employee s employers within the previous two
years.   
   (B)   As a condition of employment, the driver shall provide the village

expenses related to village operations, travel and meeting expenses, uniforms,
equipment, and maintenance.
     (C)   Management of bank credit cards.
        (1)   The bank credit cards are general spending cards issued by First
National Bank in the name of the authorized user (division (A) of this section)
and the village. Each time an authorized user is hired by the village, the bank
is notified in writing by the Fiscal Officer. The bank s credit card
application form shall be signed by the Fiscal Officer, Mayor, and the
authorized user, who shall also provide the bank with a copy of his or her
driver s license and any other documentation the bank may reasonably require,
prior to the bank ordering the card.
        (2)   Upon separation from employment with the village, an authorized
user shall return his or her bank credit card to the Fiscal Officer, who shall
be responsible for its cancellation and destruction.
        (3)   The authorized user retains control over, and is solely
responsible for securing the bank credit card issued to them and shall
immediately report a lost or stolen credit card to the bank and the Fiscal
Officer. The credit card shall only be re-issued upon satisfaction of bank
requirements.
        (4)   The village does not maintain or authorize the use of checks
associated with the bank or store credit cards.
     (D)   Purchase authorization and submission of receipts.
        (1)   When a purchase is anticipated, a purchase requisition is
prepared by the authorized user making the purchase or the departmental
administrative assistant. The purchase requisition must be authorized and
signed by the department head. The purchase requisition is submitted to the
Fiscal Officer so that a purchase order can be prepared or it can be determined
that a purchase order is in place with sufficient funds.
        (2)   Once the purchase has been made, the authorized user making the
purchase must submit the receipt or an online order confirmation to the Fiscal
Officer for attachment to the purchase requisition. If a cash register receipt
does not contain an itemized description of the item(s) purchased, the
authorized user shall write it on the tape prior to submission.
     (E)   Credit card credit limits. Each bank credit card will be assigned a
unique account number and billed separately by the bank. No duplicate credit
cards will be issued to the same account except in the event of loss as set
forth herein below. The bank credit cards issued to the Mayor and the Fiscal
Officer are used for travel, conference, meeting, and other administrative
expenses, and each card has a monthly $2,500 spending limit. The bank credit
cards issued to the department heads will each have a credit limit of $2,500.
     (F)   Tax exempt status. The village is exempt from state sales taxes, and
authorized users shall inform in-state suppliers of this exempt status and
provide a copy of the village s tax-exempt certification if necessary.
     (G)   Misuse of credit card account. The following acts or omissions
constitute misuse of the credit card account and may be subject to disciplinary
action and/or criminal prosecution:
        (1)   Any purchases not first authorized by the department head;
        (2)   Any purchases of alcoholic beverages; and
        (3)   Purchases that are for personal use and not village business.
     (H)   Conflict of interest. Use of the credit card to make any purchase
that violates the village policy and State of Ohio Ethics Law, being R.C.
Chapter 102 and §§ 2921.01, 2921.42, 2921.421, and 2921.43, prohibiting
business transactions which are or may be perceived as a conflict of interest
(such as, purchases from a business in which the authorized user, a family
member, or a business associate, has a financial or other interest).
     (I)   Receipt of cash refunds or in-store credit for any returns or
exchanges. Such amounts must be credited back to the credit card account. If a
supplier issues a refund by check or other means, it must be submitted to the
Fiscal Officer within five days of receipt by the authorized user.
     (J)   Liability. The authorized user is liable in person and upon any
official bond, he or she has given to the village to reimburse the treasury any
and all amounts for which the authorized user does not provide itemized
receipts in accordance with the policy. The use of a credit card account for
expenses beyond those authorized by Council constitutes misuse of a credit card
account. An officer or employee of the village or a public servant as defined
under R.C. § 2921.01 who knowingly misuses a credit card account held by the
municipal corporation violates R.C. § 2913.21. Possession or use of a debit
card account by a political subdivision except for law enforcement purposes is
a violation of R.C. § 2913.21.
     (K)   Compliance officer review. The Mayor shall appoint a compliance
officer, who may not be the Fiscal Officer or an authorized user. On at least a
quarterly basis, the compliance officer and Council shall review the number of
cards and accounts issued, the number of active cards and accounts issued, the
cards and accounts expiration dates, and the cards and accounts credit limits.
On an annual basis, the Fiscal Officer or his or her designee shall file a
report with Council detailing all rewards received based on the use of the
village s credit card account.
     (L)   Definition of credit card account. As used in this section, CREDIT
CARD ACCOUNT means any bank-issued credit card account, store-issued credit
card account, financial institution-issued credit card account, financial
depository-issued credit card account, affinity credit card account, or any
other card account allowing the holder to purchase goods or services on credit
or to transact with the account, and any debit or gift card account related to
the receipt of grant monies. CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT does not include a procurement
card account, gasoline or telephone credit card account, or any other card
account where merchant category codes are in place as a system of control for
use of the card account.

  § 34.59 CASH MANAGEMENT FUND.
     The Village Council adopts the following funding policy statement, with
the approval of National Bank and Trust, to control the investment of the cash
reserves of the village.
     (A)   Purpose.
        (1)   The purpose of this section is to establish an understanding
concerning the funding policies and objectives of the Cash Management Fund.
This section outlines an overall philosophy that is specific but flexible
enough to allow for changes in the economy and/or securities markets. The
village provides guidelines on which the asset manager bases investment
decisions.
        (2)   Policies and restrictions in this section should not impede
investment efforts in striving to attain the Fund s overall objectives. The
village grants discretion in asset allocation and diversification for the
purpose of increasing investment returns and/or reducing risk exposure. When
appropriate, the village also grants broad responsibility to shift the Fund s
asset commitment among sectors and individual securities to pursue
opportunities presented by secular changes within the capital markets.
     (B)   Objectives. Investments of the Cash Management Fund will be made for
the sole interest and exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the village.
The Fund s assets must be invested with the care, skill, and diligence that a
prudent person acting in this capacity would use. The asset manager s primary
objective should be preservation of principal. The assets should generate a
total return that exceeds the consumer price index and maximize yield without
undue risk for the village.
     (C)   Asset allocation. These policies have been developed after examining
the historical relationships of risk and return among asset classes. They are
designed to provide the highest probability of meeting the objective of
providing growth of principal at the lowest possible risk. The following
standards will be used to evaluate asset allocation:
        (1)   Equity investments will not be allowed;
        (2)   Fixed income securities should not exceed 100% of the Fund s
market value; and
        (3)   Cash equivalents (including all senior debt securities with less
than one year to maturity) may comprise up to 100% of the Fund s value. There
is no minimum requirement.
     (D)   Equities. Equity investments will not be allowed.

(Res. 93.011, passed 8-12-1993)  
 § 35.09 PUBLIC RECORDS AVAILABLE.
    (A)   Upon request by any person and subject to division (H) of this
section, all public records responsive to the request shall be promptly
prepared and made available for inspection to the requester at all reasonable
times during regular business hours. Subject to division (H) of this section,
upon request by any person, a public office or person responsible for public
records shall make copies of the requested public record available to the
requestor at cost and within a reasonable period of time. If a public record
contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit public inspection
or to copy the public record, the public office or the person responsible for
the public record shall make available all of the information within the public
record that is not exempt. When making that public record available for public
inspection or copying that public record, the public office or the person
responsible for the public record shall notify the requester of any redaction
or make the redaction plainly visible. A redaction shall be deemed a denial of
a request to inspect or copy the redacted information, except if federal or
state law authorizes or requires a public office to make the redaction.  
    (B)   To facilitate broader access to public records, a public office or
the person responsible for public records shall organize and maintain public
records in a manner that they can be made available for inspection or copying
in accordance with this section. A public office also shall have available a
copy of its current records retention schedule at a location readily available
to the public. If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under
this section, such that the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are
being requested, the public office or the person responsible for the requested
public record may deny the request but shall provide the requester with an
opportunity to revise the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which records are maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary
course of the public office's or person's duties.  
    (C)   If a request is ultimately denied, in part or in whole, the public
office or the person responsible for the requested public record shall provide
the requester with an explanation, including legal authority, setting forth why
the request was denied. If the initial request was provided in writing, the
explanation also shall be provided to the requester in writing. The explanation
shall not preclude the public office or the person responsible for the
requested public record from relying upon additional reasons or legal authority
in defending an action commenced under R.C. §  149.43(C).  
    (D)   Unless specifically required or authorized by state or federal law or
in accordance this section, no public office or person responsible for public
records may limit or condition the availability of public records by requiring
disclosure of the requester's identity or the intended use of the requested
public record. Any requirement that the requester disclose the requester s
identity or the intended use of the requested public record constitutes a
denial of the request.  
    (E)   A public office or person responsible for public records may ask a
requester to make the request in writing, may ask for the requester's identity,
and may inquire about the intended use of the information requested, but may do
so only after disclosing to the requester that a written request is not
mandatory and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester's identity
or the intended use and when a written request or disclosure of the identity or
intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the public
office or person responsible for public records to identify, locate or deliver
the public records sought by the requester.  
    (F)   If any person requests a copy of a public record in accordance with
this section, the public office or person responsible for the public record may
require the requester to pay in advance the cost involved in providing the copy
of the public record in accordance with the choice made by the requester under
this division. Nothing in this section requires a public office or person
responsible for the public record to allow the requester of a copy of the
public record to make the copies of the public record.  
    (G)   A public office or person responsible for public records is not
required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal
conviction or a juvenile adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any
public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning
what would be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the
investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request to inspect or to
obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is
subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who
imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or
the judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought in the
public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of
the person.  
    (H)   (1)   To ensure that all employees of public offices are
appropriately educated about a public office's obligations under this section,
all elected officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training
approved by the Attorney General as provided in R.C. §  109.43. A future
official may satisfy the requirements of this division by attending the
training before taking office, provided that the future official may not send a
designee in the future official s place.  
       (2)   All public offices shall adopt a public records policy in
compliance with this section for responding to public records requests. In
adopting a public records policy under this division, a public office may
obtain guidance from the model public records policy developed and provided to
the public office by the Attorney General under R.C. §  109.43. Except as
otherwise provided in this section or R.C. §  149.43, the policy may not limit
the number of public records that the public office will make available to a
single person, may not limit the number of public records that it will make
available during a fixed period of time, and may not establish a fixed period
of time before it will respond to a request for inspection or copying of public
records, unless that period is less than eight hours.  
       (3)   The public office shall distribute the public records policy
adopted by the public office under this division (H) to the employee of the
public office who is the records custodian or records manager or otherwise has
custody of the records of that office. The public office shall require that
employee to acknowledge receipt of the copy of the public records policy. The
public office shall create a poster that describes its public records policy
and shall post the poster in a conspicuous place in the public office and in
all locations where the public office has branch offices. The public office may
post its public records policy on the internet web site of the public office if
the public office maintains an internet web site. A public office that has
established a manual or handbook of its general policies and procedures for all
employees of the public office shall include the public records policy of the
public office in the manual or handbook.

section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the

compensation plan.

taxes are not required to be withheld under §  
36.04(A)(2); and

and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer s business

shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §  
36.12(A).  
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (D)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §  
36.12(A).  
         (d)   Nothing in division (D)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.  
      (3)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, wages, salaries, and
other compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; or  
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (D)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.  
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted; provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer; or  
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (D)(3)(a) or (D)(3)(b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer s municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator s determination was unreasonable.  
      (4)   For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (E) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be issued to a municipal corporation as

         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only of, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets any of the following criteria:  
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the village
from a stock of goods located within the village; and  
            2.   The property is delivered within the village from a location
outside the village; provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.  
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be issued to the
village to the extent that such services are performed in the village;  
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the village shall be issued to the village;  
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the village shall be issued to the
village; and  
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the village.  
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the village s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the village.
The village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit issued under this division (D)(5) to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.  
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.  
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of the village shall report the
individual s net profit from all real estate activity on the individual s
annual tax return for the village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the village s income tax ordinance.
 
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (D)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (D)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

         (a)   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER. An individual who is an
employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax

            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location; and  
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.   
         (b)   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION. A permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.   
         (c)   REPORTING LOCATION. Either of the following:   
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer; or  
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under §  
36.04 on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.   
         (d)   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION. One of the following:   
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;   
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (E)(1)(d)1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee s or owner s supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year; or  
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. or (G)(1)(d)2. of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer s business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division (E) at any time.   
      (2)   (a)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a
taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this division (E) to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of division (D) of this section apply
to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division (E).   
         (b)   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division
(E) in writing on or with the taxpayer s net profit return or, if applicable, a
timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an
assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.   
         (c)   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division (E), the taxpayer is
required to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer
shall not be required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal
corporation in which a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to
file a net profit return with that municipal corporation due to business
operations that are unrelated to the employee's or owner s activity at the
qualifying remote work location.   
         (d)   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election
applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business.
The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.   
         (e)   Nothing in this division (E) prohibits a taxpayer from making a
new election under this division (E) after properly revoking a prior election.
 
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (E)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (F)(2):   
         (a)   For the purpose of division (E)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location;  
         (b)   For the purpose of division (E)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location; and  
         (c)   For the purpose of division (E)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (E)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.   
      (4)   Nothing in this division (E) prevents a taxpayer from requesting,
or a tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to
all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method as described in division (E)(2) of this section. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a
manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a
municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.   
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (E), nothing in this
division (E) is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §  
36.04 .  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
 § 36.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Withholding provisions.  
      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the village. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §  
36.03  or division (A)(2)(d) or (A)(2)(f) of this section, the tax shall be
withheld at the rate, specified in §  
36.01, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.  
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(a) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld or the
income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer according to the following schedule:  
            1.   a.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be
remitted monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of the village in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the village in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.  
               b.   Payment under division (A)(2)(a)1. of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.  
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (A)(2)(a)1. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.  
         (b)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under IRC §  6302, 26 C.F.R. §
31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the payment shall be
made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division (A)(2)(b) does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.  
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division (A)(2)(c) shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the village as
the return required of an nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee s
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.  
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the village income tax with respect to an individual s
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.  
         (e)   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.  
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.  
         (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003 is not subject to the
village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.  
         (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.  
         (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:  
            1.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the village during the preceding calendar year;  
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;  
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;  
            4.   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee; and  
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
 
         (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.  
         (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the village
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer s employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division
(A)(2)(j), a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.  
         (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.  
   (B)   Occasional entrant; withholding.  
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.  
         EMPLOYER. A person that is a related member to or of an employer.  
         FIXED LOCATION. A permanent place of doing business in this state,
such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned or
controlled by an employer.  
         PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK.   
            1.   The fixed location to which an employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the worksite location in this
state to which the employee is required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not required to report for
employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location or
worksite location, PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK means the location in this state at
which the employee spends the greatest number of days in a calendar year
performing services for or on behalf of the employee s employer.  
            2.   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division 1. of this definition among those two or
more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's PRINCIPAL PLACE OF WORK with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.  
            3.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division 2. of this definition, except that location shall be substituted for
municipal corporation wherever municipal corporation appears in that division.

this section, an employer is not required to withhold the village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the village if the employee performed such services in the village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
 
            1.   The employee s principal place of work is located in the
village;   
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the village. For the purposes of this division, PRESUMED
WORKSITE LOCATION means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last more
than 20 days if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:  
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services; and  
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.  
            3.   The employee is a resident of the village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee s qualifying wages as provided
in §  
36.04; and  
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.  
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:  
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;  
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;  
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.  
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.  
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the village.  
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the village
under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the village.  
      (5)   (a)   If an employer s fixed location is the village and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in §  
36.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the village.  
         (b)   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer
for a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer s federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.  
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of §  
36.04.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
 § 36.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   Generally.  
      (1)   An annual village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer and any taxpayer that is not an individual for each
taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax
is due thereon.  
         (a)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under §  
36.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer s sole income subject to the tax
is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the village.  
         (b)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for the village
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives municipal taxable income taxable to the village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.  
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent s executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.  
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the village, the return or notice required of that individual shall

of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio Form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.  
         (c)   1.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the

other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway.  
         (d)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.  
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(B). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the village. No remittance is required if the net
amount due is $10 or less.  
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer s taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is $10 or less.  
         (b)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending of or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the village's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be the fifteenth day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to
file under this division (A)(7) is not an extension of the time to pay any tax
due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.  
            1.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the village's income tax return.  
            2.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the village income tax return.
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer s requested extension.  
         (c)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. §  5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the village's income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.  
         (d)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division (A)(7), including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.  
         (e)   1.   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return under division (A)(7)(b), (A)(7)(c) or (A)(7)(d) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any
notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the
taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due date to file the
return, whichever occurs first.   
            2.   If the Tax Administrator violates division (A)(7)(e) of this
section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.   
            3.   Division (A)(7)(e) of this section does not apply to an
extension received under division (A)(7)(b) of this section if the Tax
Administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a
federal extension as required to receive the extension under division (A)(7)(b)
of this section or failed to file for an extension under division (A)(7)(b) of
this section.   
         (f)   To the extent that any provision in this division (A)(7)
conflicts with any provision in division (C) of this section, the provisions in
divisions (C)(2), (C)(3), (C)(4), or (C)(5) prevail.  
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.  
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
village an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) of this section.  
         (c)   1.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the village income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:  
               a.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
village for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in 36.04(A)(2)(a)7.) within the
village; or  
               b.   The person no longer provides services in the village and
does not expect to be subject to the village income tax for the taxable year.  
            2.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within village, make any sales in village, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by village for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with village income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations . The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.  
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(8)
(c)2., the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.  
            4.   Nothing in division (A)(8)(c) of this section prohibits the
Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.  
      (9)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in §  
36.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.  
      (11)   Each return required by the village to be filed in accordance with
this division (A)(11) shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to
authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.  
      (12)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by the village; provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the village or the Tax Administrator; and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and of the village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.  
   (B)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.  
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the village's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.  
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.  
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.  
   (C)   Extension for service in or for the Armed Forces.  
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator for both an
extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment
of taxes required by the village during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
 
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division (C)(2)
(a) are not delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.  
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the village before the one hundred eighty-first
day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.  
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (C)(2)(a)
of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.  
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division (C)(3)(a) denies to any person
described in this division (C)(3)(a) the application of divisions (C)(2) and
(C)(3) of this section.  
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the village in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under this
division (C)(3)(b)1. shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this division (C)(3)(b), QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the National
Guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United
States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by
the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the United
States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.  
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(C)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period.
Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the
extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.  
      (4)   For each taxable year to which this division (C) applies to a
taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)(b) of this section,
as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the
spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.  
   (D)   Consolidated municipal income tax return.  
      (1)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.  
         AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS. An affiliated group as defined in
IRC § 1504, except that, if such a group includes at least one incumbent local

include any incumbent local exchange carrier that would otherwise be included
in the group.  
         CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. A consolidated return filed

         CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME. The consolidated taxable income

      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the village s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under this division (D)(2) or a
taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator
shall approve such a request for good cause shown.  
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under this division (D)(2). The election to discontinue filing
a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year period
beginning with the first taxable year of the election.  
         (c)   An election made under division (D)(2)(a) or (D)(2)(b) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.  
         (d)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. §  718.80,
a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (D)(2)(a) or (D)(2)(b) of
this section is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of five-
year period.  
         (e)   When an election is made under R.C. §  718.80 is terminated, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under R.C. §  718.86 is binding upon the Tax
Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.  
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the village income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless
the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.  
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated village income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of

      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (D)(5)(b), (D)(5)
(c), and (D)(5)(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated
municipal income tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as
defined in §  
36.02, by substituting consolidated federal taxable income for federal taxable
income wherever federal taxable income appears in that division and by
substituting an affiliated group of corporation s for a C corporation s
wherever a C corporation s appears in that division.  
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §  
36.02 to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to
the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of
consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:  
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this division (D), exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit issued to the village. If the
entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.  
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in this division (D), include the

taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that
are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group.  
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:  
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in this division (D), exclude the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the
computation of the affiliated group's net profit issued to the village; and  
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.  
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated the village income tax return
shall make the computations required under this division (D) by substituting
consolidated federal taxable income attributable to for net profit from
wherever net profit from appears in that section and by substituting affiliated
group of corporations for taxpayer wherever taxpayer appears in that section.  
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.  
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the village before January 1, 2016, to file a

other municipality.  
      (2)   Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the village under this chapter.  
   (B)   The village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. §  715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. §§  715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.  
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, the income,

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:  
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
 
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

36.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:  
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;

payment;

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment; or  
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.  
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.  
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year; provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the village under §  
36.05 for that year; or  
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the village but was
not domiciled there on January 1 of the calendar year that includes the first

   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the village:  
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more; or  
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is $10 or more.  
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.  
      (2)   (a)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied.  
         (b)   The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.  
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §  
36.21.  
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:  
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request;  
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day; or  
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.  
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §  
36.18(A)(4).  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.  
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the village is subject to recovery by the village. If
the village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the village
shall allow a non-refundable credit against the tax or withholding the village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.  
   (C)   If the village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the non-refundable credit shall be calculated using the
village's tax rate. However, if the village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the non-refundable
credit is to be paid to the village, along with any penalty and interest then
accrued during the period of non-payment.  
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-forward.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.  
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.  
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:  
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or  
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §  
36.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.  
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.  
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division (C) within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by the village. A request filed under this division (C)(1) shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer s annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer s
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §  
36.09.  
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.  
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer s tax liability, that taxpayer shall make
and file an amended village return showing income subject to the village income
tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional village income tax shown due thereon or make
a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less
than $10.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:  
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or  
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.  
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.  
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:  
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §  
36.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment; and  
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.  
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense; provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.  
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §  
36.09.  
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.  
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal, an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §  
36.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §  
36.09(E).  
   (E)   No civil action to recover the village income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:  
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties; or  
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
§ 36.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer s rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.  
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.  
   (C)   (1)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer
is entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a
form by which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.  
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer s attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.  
      (3)   This division (C) does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.  
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.  
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer s case.  
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
 § 36.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.  
      LAST KNOWN ADDRESS. The address the Tax Administrator has at the time a
document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. §  5703.056.  
      UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS. An address to which the postal service or an
authorized delivery service under R.C. §  5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.  
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. §  5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.  
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. §
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.  
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other the village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.  
      (2)   (a)   If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:  
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."  
         (b)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery
of the assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.  
         (c)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.  
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned, or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.  
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
(D)(2) prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.  
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.  
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.  
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the rules and regulations shall
apply.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the village that arises pursuant to the village s income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.  
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the village:
 
      (1)   Compromise a claim; or  
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.  
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
 
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.  
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.  
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.  
(Ord. 2023.021, passed 11-17-2023)  
  § 36.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the village s ordinance or state
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the village or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.  
   (C)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

  § 36.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   (A)   Authority. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
Tax Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless
the performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision
of the state statutes:  
      (1)   (a)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of any or a query nature as

which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;  
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law; and  
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in §  
36.04(A).

      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.  
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the village or for the withholding of such tax.  
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person s
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division (B)(3) does not authorize the practice of law by
a person who is not an attorney.  
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person s Social Security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.  
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §  
36.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §  
36.99.  
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §  
36.18.  
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)
(b) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or
fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in §  
36.99 for a violation of §  
36.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Administrator in accordance with the rules and regulations.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.  
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.  
   (F)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall

before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In

thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-

one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.

stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of- way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade- crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

§ 70.32 SIGNALS OVER REVERSIBLE LANES.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (A)   A steady downward green arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(R.C. § 4511.131)
§ 70.33 AMBIGUOUS OR NON-WORKING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   (A)   The driver of a vehicle who approaches an intersection where traffic
is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right-of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right-of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or
approaching on an intersecting road, if the vehicles will constitute an
immediate hazard during the time the driver is moving across or within the
intersection or junction of roadways;
      (3)   Exercise ordinary care while proceeding through the intersection.

“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

having obtained a driver’s license.

certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (A)(1) of this

         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b)2. or (A)(4)(b)3.
of this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111

two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss arising from an accident
or collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offender’s

which the offender is sentenced under this section.
(R.C. § 4510.111)
   (C)   Repeat traffic offender; point system suspension. Any person whose
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privileges are suspended as a repeat traffic offender under R.C. § 4510.037 and

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

   (A)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

driver’s license issued under R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under R.C. §§
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be in
the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
130.18, §
130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

offense is registered in the offender’s name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender’s vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so imposed
shall be distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section
unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the court grants
limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this section, the
privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the offender must
display restricted license plates, issued under R.C. § 4503.231, on the vehicle
driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver’s license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or R.C. § 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver’s license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver’s license was suspended under this section, and no person

loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.

liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton, or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall adopt rules in accordance
with R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a process for a person to be included in the

record subject to inspection or copying under R.C. § 149.43.
   (D)   Officers not permitted to stop cars to determine violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (B) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for the violation or
for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for the
violation. No law enforcement officer shall view the interior or visually

      (1)   Subject to division (F)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of division (B)(1) or (B)(3) of this section or
the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (G)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (B)(2) shall be subject to the penalty
set forth in §

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (F)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under § 73.02, shall state that the person may
have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude
the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   (a)   As used in division (D)(4)(b) and (D)(4)(c) of this section,

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if

73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (A)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken at
your own expense.
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.03, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.03 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

(R.C. § 5577.15)
§ 74.54 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self- contained,
portable, sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
vehicles on highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed
location, having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the
combined load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a
highway vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded
or unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.
(R.C. § 4513.33)
Statutory reference:
Alteration of weight limits, approval of Director required, see R.C. § 4513.33

   (B)   Whoever violates the weight provisions of this section shall be fined
$80 for the first 2,000 pounds, or fraction thereof, of overload; for overloads
in excess of 2,000 pounds, but not in excess of 5,000 pounds, such person shall
be fined $100, and in addition thereto $1 per 100 pounds of overload; for
overloads in excess of 5,000 pounds but not in excess of 10,000 pounds, such
person shall be fined $130, and in addition thereto $2 per 100 pounds of
overload, or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or both. For all overloads in
excess of 10,000 pounds, such person shall be fined $160, and in addition
thereto $3 per 100 pounds of overload, or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or
both. Whoever violates the weight provisions of vehicle and load relating to
gross load limits shall be fined not less than $100. No penalty prescribed in
this division (B)(2) shall be imposed on any vehicle combination if the
overload on any one axle does not exceed 1,000 pounds, and if the immediately
preceding or following axle, excepting the front axle of the vehicle
combination, is underloaded by the same or greater amount. For purposes of this
division (B)(2), two axles on one vehicle less than eight feet apart shall be
considered as one axle.

§ 90.01 PRIVATE SWIMMING POOLS.
   (A)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      SWIMMING POOL. A body of water of artificial construction used for
swimming or recreational bathing, which is over 24 inches deep at any point and
has more than 150 square feet of water surface area when filled to capacity.
   (B)   Location, area, and height.
      (1)   No swimming pool or appurtenance shall be located nearer than ten
feet to the side or rear line of the lot or parcel on which it is situated, or
nearer to any street than a distance ten feet greater than the building setback
line as fixed by the Zoning Code. The area of the pool exclusive of decks,
walks, and other appurtenances shall not exceed 10% of the area of the lot or
parcel on which it is situated.
      (2)   The top of the walls, decks, or walks of any swimming pool shall
not project more than two feet above the average finished grade of the pool
site or portion of the lot immediately surrounding the pool, the boundaries of
which portion extend 20 feet beyond the pool proper in each direction, except
that where any side of the pool is less than 20 feet from any lot line, the
difference between such distance and 20 feet shall be added to the required
distance of said portion beyond the opposite side. In the event that, because
of the unusual shape or grade of the lot, or the location or shape of the pool,
the foregoing formula cannot be applied with reasonable results, the Code
Enforcement Officer is empowered to fix the location of the pool site to be
used in determining the maximum grade of the pool, in keeping with the results
sought by the formula. In the event of dissatisfaction by any interested party
with the determination of the Code Enforcement Officer, an appeal may be taken
to the Planning Commission.
      (3)   No lights, diving boards, or other accessories shall project more
than ten feet above the average grade of the pool site as determined under this
section.
   (C)   Fences.
      (1)   Every swimming pool, including existing pools, shall be completely
enclosed by a fence of sturdy construction not less than 45 inches in height
measured from ground level, which shall be of such design and construction as
to effectually prevent a child from crawling or otherwise passing through or
under the fence. Each gate in the fence shall be provided with a secure lock,
and shall be kept locked at all times when the depth of the water in the pool
exceeds 18 inches, unless the pool is in use or under the immediate observation
of a responsible person. No part of any fence shall be located between the
building setback line fixed by the Zoning Code and the street on which the lot
or parcel abuts.
      (2)   The Planning Commission is empowered to make exceptions to and
modifications of the above requirement for fences as to existing pools, in
cases in which, in the Commission’s opinion, such requirements are not
essential to safety and the enforcement thereof would work hardships in the
owners.
   (D)   Lights. All lights used for illuminating the pool or surrounding areas
shall be designed, located, and installed so as to confine the direct beams to
the lot or parcel on which the pool is located, and so as not to constitute a
nuisance or undue annoyance to occupants of abutting property.
   (E)   Drainage. Provision shall be made for drainage of the pool into a
public storm sewer where possible, unless there is a ditch or natural
watercourse of sufficient size and gradient adjacent to the pool location to
carry off the water satisfactorily. In which case, drainage may be into such
ditch or watercourse. Permission must be obtained from the Code Enforcement
Officer before the pool is drained in whole or in any substantial amount in
order to prevent overloading the sewer or ditch in times of heavy rain. In no
case shall the pool be drained, directly or indirectly, into any street.
   (F)   Permits and operation of pools.
      (1)   No person shall locate, construct, install, remodel, or otherwise
change any swimming pool or appurtenances without having first submitted an
application and plans therefor to, and obtained a permit from, the Code
Enforcement Officer. The fee for such permit which shall be collected by the
Code Enforcement Officer shall be not less than $15, and in the event of new
construction shall be at the rate of $25 for each 100 square feet of water
surface area, or fraction thereof, of the pool proper.
      (2)   Such permit shall not be issued until the plans and specifications
have been approved as to structural safety and compliance with this section by
the Code Enforcement Officer, and such pool shall not be used until the
construction has been approved by the Code Enforcement Officer.
      (3)   Every pool, including existing pools, shall be provided with a
filtration system approved by the Board of Health.
      (4)   No person shall use or maintain any swimming pool in violation of
this section or of any lawful order of the Code Enforcement Officer, or in
violation of any regulation of the Board of Health of the village or any order
of the Health Commissioner issued pursuant thereto.
   (G)   Application of section. This section applies to private or
noncommercial swimming pools. Divisions (C) through (F) apply to all swimming
pools.
(Ord. 95.016, passed 12-14-1995)
§ 90.02 YARD SALE PERMIT FEE.
   Any person wishing to have a yard sale within the corporation limits of the
village shall be required to obtain a permit at the Mayor’s Office at a charge
of $10 per yard sale with a limit of four yard sales per year. The annual
community yard sales account for two of the four allowed sales per year and no

specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §

      (4)   The running at large of any animal specified in division (A)(1) of

            3.   The dog attacks another animal while the dog is off the
property of the owner of the dog.
         (d)   If the dog is sold, given to another person, or dies, notify the

         (a)   Debark or surgically silence a dog that the person knows or has

(B)(6) of this section that the veterinarian who is charged with the violation
obtained, prior to debarking or surgically silencing the dog, a written waiver
form that complies with division (B)(7) of this section and that attests that
the dog is not a dangerous dog.
      (9)   (a)   The County Auditor shall issue a dangerous dog registration

         (b)   Upon the issuance of a dangerous dog registration certificate to
the owner of a dog, the County Auditor shall provide the owner with a uniformly
designed tag that identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall
renew the certificate annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the
initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (B)(9)
(c)2. of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
         (c)   1.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.
            2.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration

section.
(R.C. § 955.22)
   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable; and
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, §
91.28(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog, and §
91.36 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

more than $100 on a first offense, and on each subsequent offense shall be
fined not less than $75 or more than $250 and may be imprisoned for not more

dog that is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may
order the offender to personally supervise the dog that the offender owns,
keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to
do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(E))
      (2)   (a)   Whoever commits a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the
first offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent
offense involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading
guilty to a third violation of division (B)(3) of this section involving the
same dog, the court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as
a dangerous dog.
         (b)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (D)(2)(a) of
this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at
the owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final
determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that
division and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or
restrained in accordance with division (B)(4) of this section or at the county
dog pound at the owner’s expense.
(R.C. § 955.99(G))
      (4)   (a)   Whoever commits a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a vicious dog is guilty of one of the following:
            1.   A felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the
dog kills or seriously injures a person. Additionally, the court shall order
that the vicious dog be humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the
county dog warden, or the county humane society at the owner’s expense; or
            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed
under division (D)(4)(a)2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that §
91.28(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to
the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog and that §
91.36 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part of
the order, the court shall order the offender to obtain the liability insurance
required under division (B)(5)(a) of this section in an amount, exclusive of
interest and costs, that equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the court makes a
final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of
division (B)(3) of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the
dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions described
in division (B)(4) of this section or at the county dog pound at the owner’s

this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 955.99(M))
      (8)   Whoever violates division (B)(9)(d) of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor.

division (D)(3), (D)(4), or (D)(6) of this section, the county dog warden shall
give written notice of the confinement to the owner of the dog. If the county
dog warden is unable to give the notice to the owner of the dog, the county dog
warden shall post the notice on the door of the residence of the owner of the
dog or in another conspicuous place on the premises at which the dog was
seized. The notice shall include a statement that a security in the amount of
$100 is due to the county dog warden within ten days to secure payment of all
reasonable expenses, including medical care and boarding of the dog for 60
days, expected to be incurred by the county dog pound in caring for the dog
pending the determination. The county dog warden may draw from the security any

determination under division (D)(3), (D)(4), or (D)(6) of this section, the
county dog warden shall provide the owner of the dog with the actual cost of
the confinement of the dog. If the county dog warden finds that the security
provided under division (D)(9)(a) of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the
security provided under division (D)(9)(a) of this section is greater than that

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 93.01 WEEDS AND GRASS.
   (A)   The owner, occupant, or any other person or entity, having charge or
management of any lot or lands situated within the village, shall cut down and
remove weeds, grass, or plant growth in excess of eight inches in height on the
entire lot or parcel.
   (B)   This excludes trees, bushes, flowers, ornamental plants and shrubs,
gardens, or cultivated crops and areas which are heavily forested and in a
natural state.
   (C)   In the case of noncompliance with or violation of this section by any
person, firm, corporation, or entity, the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause
written notice of noncompliance to be served upon the person or entity, having
charge or management of any lot or lands situated within the village who is not
complying with said ordinance, via regular U.S. mail, and the Code Enforcement
Officer shall obtain a certificate of mailing from the U.S. Postal Service for
said mailing. Said notice shall notify him or her that:
      (1)   Weeds, grass, or plant growth in excess of eight inches in height
are growing on such lands and that they must be cut within five days after the
service of such notice;
      (2)   If the recipient of the notice fails to comply with the notice, the
village will take whatever action is reasonably necessary to bring this
property into compliance with this section, including, but not limited to,
causing the vegetation on said property to be cut or abated with herbicides by
the Street Department, other personnel, or contractors hired by the village; or
      (3)   The recipient will be billed for all costs of bringing this
property into compliance, including fees for postage. Should the recipient fail
to pay said bill within ten days, then said charges will be verified to the
County Auditor to be assessed with the normal real estate taxes for said
property.
   (D)   The notice of noncompliance shall be in substantially similar form to
the notice which is attached to this section and incorporated herein as though
rewritten. If the owner, occupant, or other person or entity having charge over
any property not in compliance with division (A) of this section, is unknown,
it is sufficient to satisfy the notice requirement of division (C) of this
section to publish a notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
county.
   (E)   If the owner, occupant, or any other person or entity, having charge
or management of any lot or lands not in compliance with this section fails to
abate said noncompliance within five days after service of the notice required
by division (C) of this section, then the Code Enforcement Officer shall cause
the vegetation of said property to be cut or abated with herbicides by the
Street Department, other personnel, or contractors hired by the village, and

Authority. Upon receiving a report of said abatement and the costs thereof from
the Mayor, the Legislative Authority shall promptly pay the reasonable costs
and expenses thereof from the General Fund of the village.
   (F)   The Fiscal Officer shall send a written bill for all costs associated
with abatement of noncompliance with this section, including the reasonable
costs of postage for notices, to the owner, occupant, or any other person or
entity, having charge or management of any lot or lands situated within the
village, who is in noncompliance with this section. Said written bill shall
state that the balance is due within ten days after receipt, and shall be sent
via certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested. Should said mail be returned
unclaimed, and then a second copy of said bill shall be sent via regular U.S.
mail, and shall be deemed served upon said person or entity on the date of
mailing. The Fiscal Officer shall obtain a certificate of mailing from the
postal service for said regular mail service. Any funds received from any
person or entity for payment of said bill shall be immediately deposited into
the General Fund of the village.
   (G)   Should the owner, occupant, or any other person or entity, fail to pay
the entire balance due within ten days after service of a written bill pursuant
to this section, then the Legislative Authority shall make a written return to
the County Auditor of their action under this section, with a statement of the
charges for their services, the amount paid for labor, the fees of the officers
serving the notices, the cost of postage, and a proper description of the
premises. These amounts, when allowed, shall be entered upon the tax duplicate
and shall be a lien upon such lands from and after the date of entry and be
collected as other taxes and returned to the municipality, and deposited to the
General Fund.
(Ord. 2011.020, passed 5-26-2011)
§ 93.02 LEAVING UNLICENSED MOTOR VEHICLE IN OPEN STORAGE.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided by village ordinance, no unlicensed
vehicles, whether operable or inoperable, may be stored overnight in an outdoor
location on the premises of any property within the village.
   (B)   The Zoning Inspector or the Chief of Police shall serve notice either
by certified mail with return receipt requested or in person, to the person
having the right to the possession of the property on which unlicensed motor
vehicles are stored, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, that any
unlicensed vehicles either be housed in a garage or suitable structure, or
shall be removed from the property. In the event notice is refused or goes
unclaimed, notice shall be served by its posting upon the principal structure
located upon the property.
   (C)   No person shall willfully leave unlicensed motor vehicles in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that unlicensed motor vehicles are so left is prima facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

§ 95.01 PURPOSE.
   The village recognizes that parades and assemblages provide recreational
opportunities for its residents, provide economic stimulus to its businesses,
and encourage a sense of community spirit among its residents. The village also
recognizes that parades and assemblages require municipal services beyond those
provided on a day-to-day basis, and further, that the cost of these additional
services should not be borne entirely by village taxpayers who may or may not
benefit from the parade or assemblage. The village hereby adopts this chapter
to require the organizer of any such event to bear the cost of providing
municipal services required for the successful and safe operation of the event.
(Ord. 2020.009, passed 4-23-2020)

immediately adjacent to his or her vehicle at all times when such vehicle is
upon the public street, except that when necessary, a driver may be absent from

or annoying tone of voice or by sign or in any manner to annoy any person or

discharge passengers, except upon one-way streets, where passengers may be
discharged at either the right or left sidewalk, or the side of the roadway in
the absence of a sidewalk.

use his or her vehicle for any purpose other than the transporting of
passengers, or the transporting of parcels or packages not exceeding 100
pounds.
§ 110.27 OPEN STANDS; USE.

shall advance forward as the cabs ahead pull off. Drivers shall stay within

that is parked at open stands.

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Means purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Means reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. Means a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. The term does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
Statutory reference:
Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
Statutory reference:
Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person’s use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department

section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same
facts and circumstances.
      (7)   Any moneys acquired from the sale of personal effects, tools, or

were used in the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2905.32, 2907.21, or
2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)
shall be placed in the Victims of Human Trafficking Fund created by R.C. §
5101.87.
(R.C. § 2981.12)
   (C)   Disposition of contraband, proceeds, or instrumentalities. Except as
otherwise provided in R.C. § 2981.13, property ordered forfeited as contraband,
proceeds, or an instrumentality pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2981 shall be disposed
of, used, or sold pursuant to division (B) of this section or R.C. § 2981.12.
If the property is to be sold under division (B) of this section or R.C. §
2981.12, the prosecutor shall cause notice of the proposed sale to be given in
accordance with law.

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C. §
1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Ohio
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
130.99 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 through 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) through (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(B)(1)(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 through 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, this
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 through 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27)
 
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Generally. Except where otherwise specifically classified within the
body of the section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section
shall be deemed a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more
than $500, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may

duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:

is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
(G)(1)(b)2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (F)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (G) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 through 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender’s payment history available to the victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of

of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),

complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially

offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
FAIR MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The

and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice, or, if the
accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court,
present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was the
basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court

on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Ohio Constitution Article XVIII, § 3 grants municipalities the legal
authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village Council
does ordain the following chapter.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)
§ 151.002 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, the regulations in this chapter are adopted.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)
§ 151.003 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding; and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; streets; and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)
§ 151.004 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)
§ 151.005 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the village as identified in §
151.006, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
village.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)
§ 151.006 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.

§ 151.009 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance of this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
(Ord. 2021.017, passed 8-12-2021)

any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   ZONE A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood
in any given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   ZONES A1-30 and ZONE AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   ZONE A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.

levees from the base flood.
      (7)   ZONE C and ZONE X (UNSHADED). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION or FPE. The base flood elevation. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the FLOOD
PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODPROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures, and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. 
      (1)   The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
      (2)   The FLOODWAY is an extremely hazardous area and is usually
characterized by any of the following: moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the state’s inventory of historic place
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by village’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and results in the
modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, or flood
insurance studies.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to human-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The LOWEST FLOOR of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure below the
LOWEST FLOOR which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area; provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in this chapter for enclosures below
the LOWEST FLOOR.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of this chapter, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 4781.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in the O.A.C § 4781-12-01(K), any tract
of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK does not include any tract of land used solely for the
storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base
flood elevations shown on a community’s flood insurance rate map are
referenced.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This INSURANCE is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION.
      (1)   Structures for which the start of construction commenced on or
after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by village and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      (2)   For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for
which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an
initial FIRM date of August 5, 1991 or after
December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in the R.C. § 111.15(A)
(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or
any court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is built on a single chassis; 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture pursuant to R.C. §§ 4703.01 and 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA or AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the
floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood insurance studies, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood hazard boundary maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-
30, or A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal, state, or local sources of data
including, but not limited to, historical flood information reflecting high
water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated
with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued; provided the
actual START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.
      (1)   Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to the before damaged condition would equal or exceed
50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. The
village, to enable repetitive loss structures to be eligible for increased cost
of compliance (ICC) coverage, hereby adopts a repetitive loss provision (higher
standard).
      (2)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means flood related damage sustained by a
structure on separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds
25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a historic structure; provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.

required in accordance with division (A) of this section, prepared in a format
required for a conditional letter of map revision or letter of map revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         (a)   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         (b)   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map
revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to division (A)(1) of
this section.
   (B)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator may
request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that does
not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations, such
as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be submitted at
any time.
   (C)   Annexation and detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the village’s flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the village boundaries, include within
such notification a copy of a map of the village suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the village
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.

§ 151.036 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard.
   (A)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (B)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in §§
151.070 through
151.075.
   (D)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this chapter
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.

§ 151.037 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (A)   Zone A.
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilize as best available data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final food
elevation determination has been provided in a letter of final determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (B)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO.
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However:
         (a)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected; and
         (b)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of §
151.059(B) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (C)   Zones B, C, and X. Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary
FIRM or FIS are not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the
effective FIRM which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO.
Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data
to ensure that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are
protected.

flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, and the like. After such a damage
event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   (B)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

§ 151.059 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in this
chapter, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized.
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.035(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted; provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible; and
         (b)   Section 151.059(A)(2)(a) and (A)(2)(c) through (A)(2)(e).
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose this chapter, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply.
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
151.035(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

§ 151.073 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of this chapter
would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a variance.
The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of this chapter, not inconsistent with federal
regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owning to
special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Zoning Board.
   (B)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (C)   Public hearing. 
      (1)   At such hearing, the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations, and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this chapter
does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws;
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages; and
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (D)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing divisions (C)(1) to (C)(11) of this
section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

152.02   Scope of requirements
   
152.03   Illumination
   
152.04   Abandoned signs
   
152.05   Unlawful signs
   
152.06   Signs placed in Cherry Street right-of-way and/or in any easements

152.08   Signs authorized without permits
   
152.09   Prohibited signs
   
152.10   Permitted signs
§ 152.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is hereby determined that regulation of the location, size,
placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to
locate goods, services, and facilities without difficulty and confusion, to
promote traffic safety, safeguard public health and welfare, and prevent
wasteful use of natural resources in competition among businesses for
attention.
   (B)   In addition, it is the intent of this chapter to assure the continued
attractiveness of the total village environment through the adoption of
discretionary controls designed to preserve scenic, aesthetic, and economic
values within the village. It is further determined that signs lawfully erected
and maintained under the provisions of this chapter are consistent with
customary usage.
   (C)   The standards contained herein are intended to be content neutral
while achieving the following objectives:
      (1)   Recognize the proliferation of signs is unduly distracting to
motorists and nonmotorists travelers, reduces the effectiveness of signs
directing and warning the public, causes confusion, reduces desired uniform
traffic flow, and creates the potential for vehicular crashes;
      (2)   Prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public because
of structural deficiencies or disrepair;
      (3)   Require signs to conform to the village character and scale, and
reduce visual pollution caused by a proliferation of signs which could diminish
the village’s image, property values, and quality of life;
      (4)   Recognize that the principal intent of commercial signs, to meet
the purpose of this chapter and serve the public interest, should be for
identification of an establishment on the premises, and not for advertising
special events, brand names, or off-premises activities; alternative channels
of advertising communication and media are available for advertising that does
not create visual blight and compromise safety of the motoring public;
      (5)   Enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities without
excessive difficulty and confusion by restricting the number and placement of
signs;
      (6)   Prevent placement of signs that will conceal or obscure signs of
adjacent uses;
      (7)   Protect the public right to receive messages, especially
noncommercial messages such as religious, political, economic, social,
philosophical, and other types of information protected by the First Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution;
      (8)   Achieve a substantial government interest for public safety,
aesthetics, and protection of property values;
      (9)   Maintain and improve the image of the village by encouraging signs
that are compatible with and complimentary to related buildings, uses, and
adjacent streets through the establishment of limited discretionary standards
and specific standards for this commercial/industrial area in the village; and
      (10)   To prohibit all signs that are not expressly permitted under this
chapter.

PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
§ 153.025 GENERALLY.
   Whenever a division of a tract of land meets the criteria stated under this
section, the procedure for approval of such division shall be as follows:
   (A)   The owner and/or his or her agent of the tract of land shall have
prepared by a registered surveyor an accurate drawing to a scale not less than
1" = 50', or to such other scale acceptable to the Planning Commission, showing
the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the owner(s), and the name of the
registered surveyor who prepared the drawing;
      (2)   Date, approximate north point, and graphic scale;
      (3)   The location of existing and platted property lines, streets,
buildings, watercourses, railroads, sewers, bridges, culverts, drain pipes,
water mains, and any public utility easements on the land to be subdivided;
      (4)   The locations, widths, and other dimensions of proposed easements,
parks, and other open spaces, reservations, lot lines, building lines, and
utilities; and
      (5)   The acreage of each individual parcel being created by the
division.
   (B)   (1)   The owner and/or his or her agent shall provide the Planning
Commission’s authorized engineer with the original drawing. If the authorized
engineer is satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to the
general requirements and standards of design of this chapter; is not contrary
to other applicable platting, subdividing, or zoning regulations; and that
approval of such subdivision will not create or lead to the creation of any
serious health threat, he or she shall within seven working days after
submission, approve such division and shall sign a certificate of approval for
recording on the plat (see Form 3 in this section). If such division is not
approved, the reasons for such action shall be stated to the owner and/or his
or her agent in writing. All applications and subsequent action taken on such
subdivisions shall be reported to the Planning Commission at the following
regular meeting of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the owner and/or his or her agent of the property disagree with
the decision or requirements specified by the authorized engineer, he or she
may then appeal to the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Once approval is granted by the authorized engineer acting for the
Planning Commission or by the Planning Commission, the original drawing shall
be filed with the County Recorder as the official drawing of record. Failure to
file such approved drawing within one year of such approval shall void the
approval.
      (4)   To prevent the many development problems that occur from
subdividing land along existing roadways on a piecemeal basis, the following
regulations shall apply:
         (a)   No owner of any parcel of land as shown on the tax maps on June
5, 1957 shall subdivide such land into more than five lots of less than five
acres as a minor subdivision; and
         (b)   No frontage of any existing street shall be subdivided to the
extent that less than 50% of the original parcel frontage as shown on the June
5, 1957 tax maps is retained as a part of such original parcel unless exempted
by the Planning Commission.
      (5)   Whenever a proposed subdivision of land exceeds any of the above
limitations, such subdivision of land shall follow the procedure for plat
approval for major subdivisions. Exceptions to the above may be granted by the
Planning Commission, only when it can be clearly shown that platting under the
procedure for major subdivisions would be of no value in obtaining better
subdivision of the land.
      (6)   For any reason, the Planning Commission’s authorized engineer or
the subdivider may require that the minor subdivision be submitted under the
regulations for major subdivisions.
      (7)   A minor subdivision shall contain the following certificates in
lieu of those required for a major subdivision.
   Form 1 Certificate of Ownership and Dedication
I (we) hereby certify that I am (we are) the owner(s) of the property shown and
described hereon and that I (we) hereby adopt this plan of subdivision with my

PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL FOR MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS
§ 153.040 GENERALLY.
   The procedure for review and approval for major subdivisions consists of two
separate steps. The initial step is the preparation and submission to the
Planning Commission of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision. The
second step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a
final plat together with required certificates. This final plat becomes the
instrument to be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of the county when duly
signed by the chairperson of the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.041 PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.
   In order to make the most of the opportunities to the subdivision and to
conserve time, effort, and expense, the subdivider should consult with the
Planning Commission, the Planning Commission’s authorized engineer, Board of
Public Affairs, Fire Department, Board of Public Affairs, Street Commissioner,
County Soil Conservation District, and other public officials prior to the
preparation of the preliminary plat of the subdivision. Official plans for the
village and zoning of the area should be reviewed to determine how the proposed
subdivision will fit into such plans. Requirements of the official plans;
school and recreational sites; shopping centers, community facilities;
sanitation; water supply and drainage; and relationship to other developments,
existing and proposed in the vicinity, should be determined in advance of the
preparation of the subdivision plan. Consultation should also be held with
those familiar with the economic factors affecting the subdivision. A thorough
estimate of the situation will result in sound decisions with respect to the
form, character, and extent of the proposed subdivision. No land shall be
subdivided for residential use unless adequate access to the land over improved
streets or thoroughfares exists or will be provided by the subdivider, or if
such land is considered by the Planning Commission to be unsuitable for such
use by reason of flooding or improper drainage, objectionable earth and rock
formation, topography, or any other feature harmful to the health and safety of
possible residents and the community as a whole.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.042 PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (A)   (1)   At least ten days prior to the meeting at which it is to be
considered, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission six copies
of a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision drawn to a scale of not less
than 1" = 100'.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the copies of the preliminary plat, the Planning
Commission shall forward copies of the preliminary plat to the County Soil
Conservation District, the Fire Department, the Board of Public Affairs, and
the Street Commissioner, and to the Planning Commission’s authorized engineer
for the purpose of study and recommendation. These officials shall be informed
of the meeting date at which the preliminary subdivision plat is to be
considered and requested to make a report on such subdivision to the Planning
Commission by or on such date.
   (B)   The preliminary plat which shall meet the minimum standards of design
and the general requirements for the construction of improvements as set forth
in §§
153.055  through
153.066  shall give the following information insofar as possible:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision name and location, the name and address of
the owner or owners, and the name of the registered surveyor who prepared the
plat;

streets, alleys, easements, parks, and other open spaces, reservations, lot
lines, building lines, and utilities;
      (6)   Utilities, including sanitary and storm sewer, other drainage
facilities; water lines; gas mains; electric utilities and other facilities,
size or capacity of each should be shown and the location and distance to each
existing utility indicated. All sanitary sewers and water supply systems shall
be connected to the village sanitary sewer and water supply systems;
      (7)   Contours at vertical intervals of two feet if the general slope is
less than 10% and at vertical intervals of five feet if the general slope is
greater than 10% of not more than five feet;
      (8)   Plans for minimizing erosion and sediment on the land to be
developed unless exempted by the Planning Commission;
      (9)   The acreage of the land to be subdivided; and
      (10)   Location sketch map showing relationship of subdivision site to
area including thoroughfares, commercial or railroads, and other natural or
human-made features.
   (C)   In addition to the preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit the
following:
      (1)   An area plan, except when not determined necessary by the Planning
Commission, showing the relationship of the proposed subdivision to the area
including thoroughfares, railroads, commercial or industrial uses in the
vicinity, schools, parks, watercourses, or lakes, wooded areas, and other
natural or human-made features. The area plan should also show how the adjacent
land can be subdivided in subsequent development phases and how it could relate
to the proposed subdivision;

Planning Commission or its authorized engineer or within such further time as
the applicant may agree to, the Planning Commission will review it and indicate
its approval, disapproval, or approval subject to modifications as a basis for
the preparation of the final plat. If a plat is disapproved, reasons for such
disapproval will be stated in writing. The grounds for disapproval, including
citation of or reference to the rule or regulation violated by the plat, shall
be entered in the minutes of the Commission and the refusal endorsed on at
least one of the plats. If approved subject to modifications, the nature of the
required modification will be indicated.
   (E)   After acceptance of the preliminary plat for review by the Planning
Commission or its authorized engineer, failure of the Planning Commission to
act on the preliminary plat within 30 days or within such further time as the
applicant may agree to will be deemed approval of this plat.
   (F)   The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission will
not constitute acceptance of the final plat and will not be indicated on the
preliminary plat.
   (G)   One copy of the preliminary plat will be retained in the Planning
Commission files, and one copy will be returned to the subdivider with any
notations at the time of approval or disapproval and the specific changes, if
any, required.
   (H)   The approval of the preliminary plat shall lapse unless a final plat
based thereon is submitted within one year from the date of such approval
unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)

tracing, he or she must provide a duplicate permanent transparency acceptable
to the County Engineer.
   (C)   The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove this final plat
within 30 days after its submission to the Planning Commission or its
authorized engineer. Failure of the Planning Commission to act on this final
plat within these 30 days shall be deemed approval of it. If the plat is
disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the records of
the Planning Commission.

   (A)   General. The subdivision shall conform to any officially adopted
development plan(s) of the municipality for land use or public facilities.
   (B)   Infrastructure plans. All improvements to municipal streets,
utilities, and storm drainage shall be constructed in conformance with plans
prepared by a professional engineer registered in the state.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.056 STREETS.
   (A)   Conformity to the thoroughfares. The location and width of all streets
and roads shall conform to any land use or thoroughfare plan officially adopted
by the village and to good design practices which take into consideration the
topography of the land, natural features, and other assets which will enhance
the environment of the subdivision and surrounding development.
   (B)   Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system shall
extend existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case less than
the required minimum width unless exempted for good reason by the Planning
Commission.

                    access
Notes:
1   Pavement and right-of-way widths of cul-de-sacs and right-of-way
requirements should conform to standards of either local or collector streets
as dictated by anticipated average daily traffic. Cul-de-sac turnarounds shall
have a minimum pavement radius of 40 feet and a minimum right-of-way radius of
55 feet.
2   Pavement and right-of-way widths of marginal access streets and right-of-
way requirements should conform to the standards of either local or collector
streets as dictated by anticipated daily traffic. If the classification is a
collector requiring a 36-foot pavement, pavement width may be reduced to 28
feet since frontage is restricted to one side of the street.
3   Pavement and right-of-way widths of divided streets and right-of-way
requirements should conform to the standards of street classification as
dictated by anticipated average daily traffic and be applied to aggregate
dimensions of the two street segments.
4   Pavement and right-of-way widths of commercial and industrial streets,
such as in industrial parks and/or commercial complexes shall be designed in
consideration of average dally traffic flow and shall be subject to approval
by the Planning Commission and their traffic engineer.
5   Major thoroughfares are for the most part already established and existing
in the village. Some proposed major thoroughfares are indicated on officially
adopted village plans. Pavement and right-of-way of any existing or new major
thoroughfare will be determined by the Village Council, Planning Commission,
and their traffic engineer on a case-by-case basis depending upon traffic
flow, uses served, and other conditions. Average daily traffic flow will
generally exceed 2,000 motor vehicles per day. Pavement width is measured from
the middle of the curb face to the opposite middle of the curb face, or when
no curbs exist, from pavement edge to pavement edge.
 
   (D)   Additional width of existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the above
minimum street width requirements.
      (1)   The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
      (2)   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of
the existing roadway shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting right-
of-way width be less than 40 feet.
   (E)   Street grades. Grades on collector streets shall not exceed 7%. Grades
on local streets may exceed 7% but not 10%. In hillside areas with an average
slope of 10% or more, the slope on local streets may be increased to 12%, but
only for short, straight, stretches upon approval of the Planning Commission.
   (F)   Horizontal curves. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees
in the alignment of a street occurs, a curb of reasonable long radius shall be
introduced. On major thoroughfares, the centerline radius of curvature shall be
not less than 300 feet; on local and collector streets, not less than 100 feet.
In hillside areas with an average slope of 10% or more, the centerline radius
of curvature may be reduced to not less than 200 feet on major thoroughfares
and to not less than 75 feet on local and collector streets upon approval of
the Planning Commission.
   (G)   Vertical curves. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical
curbs of minimum length in feet equal to 15 times the algebraic difference in
rates of grade for major streets and one-half this minimum length for minor
streets. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades drawn to a
scale of not less than 1" = 100' horizontal, and 1" = 20' vertical, may be
required by the Planning Commission. In hillside areas with an average slope of
10% or more, this minimum length may be further decreased upon approval of the
Planning Commission.
   (H)   Street elevations. The Planning Commission shall not approve any
streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding. All streets must be
located at elevations which will make them flood free in order that portions of
the subdivisions will not be isolated by floods. Where flood conditions exist,
the Planning Commission shall require street profiles and elevations in order
to determine the advisability of permitting the proposed subdivision activity.
   (I)   Intersections.
      (1)   Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is
possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 80 degrees.
      (2)   Curb line radii at street intersections of two minor streets shall
be 20 feet. Larger curb radii may be required at other types of intersections.
Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable
radius without curtailing width, the property line at such street corner shall
be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.
      (3)   All streets entering on a heavily traveled street shall have
sufficient safe site distance and in no case less than 350 feet.
      (4)   All driveways shall be more than 30 feet from any street
intersections.
   (J)   Tangents. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be introduced
between reverse curves on major thoroughfares. In hillside areas with an
average slope of 10% or more, this requirement for major thoroughfares may be
reduced to 50 feet subject to approval of the Planning Commission. There shall
be no tangent requirement for reverse curves on local or collector streets
unless required by the Planning Commission.
   (K)   Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall not be allowed except in cases where warranted by unusual topography or
other circumstances and subject to approval of the Planning Commission.
   (L)   Dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs.
      (1)   Streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed shall
be no more than 500 feet long. They shall be provided at the closed end with a
turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a street
right-of-way diameter of at least 110 feet. When dead-end streets are not more
than 200 feet long, “T” type or other types of turnarounds not requiring the
use of private property may be utilized when approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)   Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is desirable
to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property. Such dead-end streets
shall be provided with an appropriate turnaround subject to approval of the
Planning Commission. Dead-end streets shall not exceed 500 feet.
   (M)   Private streets and reserve strips. Every subdivided property shall be
served from a publicly dedicated street. There shall be no reserve strips
controlling access to streets except where the control of such strips is
definitely placed with the village under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (N)   Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with
others already existing and named, shall bear the names of existing streets. In
no case shall the name for proposed streets duplicate existing street names,
irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, driveway,
place, or court.
   (O)   Alleys. Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions,
except where justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in
commercial and industrial districts if other provisions cannot be made for
adequate service access.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992; Ord. 2002.005, passed - -2002)
§ 153.057 BLOCKS.
   (A)   Length. Blocks shall not be less than 400 nor more than 1,200 feet in
length, except as the Planning Commission may permit to secure efficient use of
the land or desired features of street pattern. In blocks over 800 feet in
length, the Planning Commission may require one or more public crosswalks of
not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block and at
locations deemed necessary.
   (B)   Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two tiers of lots of
minimum depth, except where fronting on major streets or prevented by
topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the Planning
Commission will approve a single tier of lots of minimum depth.
   (C)   Irregular shapes. Irregular shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-
sac or loop streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be
approved by the Planning Commission property designed and located and if
maintenance of interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.058 LOTS.
   (A)   Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. Each lot must
front upon a public street of road right-of-way which is not less than 50 feet
in width.
   (B)   Minimum lot size.
      (1)   Size of properties reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial properties shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service
and parking facilities required by the type of use and development
contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an
overall design of the land to be used for such purpose.
      (2)   The size and widths of lots shall in no case be less than the
minimum requirements of the Zoning Code in effect.
      (3)   No lot may have a depth of more than two and one-half times the
average width of the lot except as approved by the Planning Commission, or less
than 100 feet in depth.
   (C)   Minimum lot width. No lot shall have less lot width at the building
line than is required by the Zoning Code applying to the area in which it is
located. No lot shall abut on a street for a distance less than 40 feet.
   (D)   Building setback lines.
      (1)   The minimum depth of building setback lines from the street right-
of-way shall not be less than required by the minimum yard depth as established
in the Zoning Code, and in no case shall any residential building setback line
be less than 30 feet, and in the case of corner lots, 30 feet from the side
street.
      (2)   Building setback lines from the street right-of-way on all U.S. and
state highways and/or major thoroughfares shall not be less than one-half the
existing or proposed right-of-way width, whichever is greater.
   (E)   Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently wider and larger to
permit the additional side yard requirements of any zoning ordinance or
building setback lines outlined in the division (D) of this section.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.059 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (A)   General conditions. The Planning Commission shall not approve any plat
of subdivision which does not make adequate provisions for storm or flood water
runoff channels or basins. The storm water drainage system shall be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where required,
shall be designed by the rational method, or other methods as approved by the
Planning Commission, and a copy of design computations shall be provided so
that surface water is not earned across or around any intersection, nor for a
distance of more than 600 feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that
curb capacities are exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for
flow beyond that point, and basins shall be used to intercept flow at that
point. Surface water drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot
and block.
   (B)   Requirements for storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission
to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist
either previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with Ohio Department of Transportation specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers. 
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the municipality’s authorized engineer.
However, in subdivisions containing lots less than 13,600 square feet in area
and in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall
be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved out-
fall. Inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the village’s authorized
engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the village’s authorized engineer and the Planning
Commission, the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water
disposal by a public utility system at the time the flat receives final
approval. Provision for such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in
the performance bond required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The village’s authorized engineer shall review and approve the
necessary size of the facility, as designed by the subdivider, based on the
provisions of the construction standards and specifications assuming conditions
of maximum potential watershed development permitted by the village’s official
plans and Zoning Code.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The village’s authorized
engineer shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream
drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision. Drainage studies
together with such other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a
guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the additional
runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Planning Commission may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said
potential condition in such sum as the Planning Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an
adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      (5)   Areas of poor drainage. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
which is subject to flooding, the Planning Commission may approve such
subdivision provided that the applicant fills the affected area of said
subdivision to an elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and
lots at a minimum of 12 inches above the elevation of the maximum probable
flood, as determined by the village’s authorized engineer. The plat of such
subdivision shall provide for an overflow zone along the bank of any stream or
watercourse, in a width which shall be sufficient in times of high water to
contain or move the water, and no fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor
shall any structure be erected or placed therein. The boundaries of the
overflow zone shall be subject to approval by the village’s authorized
engineer. Areas of extremely poor drainage should be discouraged.
      (6)   Floodplain areas. The Planning Commission, may when it deems it
necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of the present and future
population of the area and necessary to the conservation of water, drainage,
and sanitary facilities, prohibit the subdivision of any portion of the
property which lies within the officially designated floodplain of any stream
or drainage course. These floodplain areas shall be preserved from any and all
destruction or damage resulting from clearing, grading, or dumping of earth,
waste material, or stumps, except at the discretion of the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Dedication of drainage easements. 
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines
of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements. 
         (a)   When topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 15 feet in width for such drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         (c)   The subdivider shall dedicate, either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Planning Commission and/or its authorized
engineer.
         (d)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowmg during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be
computed in determining the number of lots to be utilized for average density
procedure nor for computing the area requirement of any lot.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.060 PUBLIC USE AND SERVICE AREA.
   Due consideration shall be given to the allocation of areas suitably located
and of adequate size for playgrounds and parks for local or neighborhood use as
well as public service areas.
   (A)   Public open space. Where a school, neighborhood park, or recreation
area, or public access to water frontage, shown in a plan made and officially
adopted by the village, is located in whole or in part in the applicant’s
subdivision, or is desirable in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the
Planning Commission may require the reservation of such open space within the
subdivision for park, school, or recreation purposes for up to two years to
achieve acquisition by the appropriate agency.
   (B)   Easements for utilities. The Planning Commission may require
easements, not exceeding 12 feet in width, for poles, wires, conduits, storm
and sanitary sewers, gas, water, and heat mains or other utility lines, along
all rear lot lines and/or along all side lot lines if necessary. Easements of
the same or greater width may be required along the lines of or across lots,
where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities.
   (C)   Easements along streams and drainage courses. Whenever any stream or
important surface drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the
subdivider shall provide an adequate easement as determined by the Planning
Commission and/or its authorized engineer along each side of the stream for the
purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, or protecting the stream or
drainage course for drainage or public use.
   (D)   Community assets. In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical spots, and
similar community assets which is preserved, will add attractiveness and value
to the property and community.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.061 SUITABILITY OF THE LAND.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if
from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has
been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not
suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed.
   (B)   Land subject to flooding and land deemed to be topographically
unsuitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy, nor for such other
uses as may increase danger to health, life, or property or aggravate erosion
or flood hazards. Such land within the plat shall be set aside for such uses as
shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not
produce unsatisfactory living conditions.
   (C)   The Planning Commission may refuse to approve what it considers to be
scattered or premature subdivision of the land which would involve danger or
injury to the public health, safety, welfare, or prosperity by reason of lack
of adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads, and
transportation facilities or other public services; or which would necessitate
an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.062 LARGE TRACTS OR PARCELS.
   When the land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots,
such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of future streets
and logical further resubdivision.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.063 GROUP HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS.
   A comprehensive group housing development, including the large scale
construction of housing units together with necessary drives and ways of access
may be approved by the Planning Commission although the decision of the project
does not include standard street, lot, and subdivision arrangements, if
departure from the foregoing standards can be made without destroying their
intent.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.064 ZONING OR OTHER REGULATIONS.
   (A)   No final plat of land within the force and effect of the Zoning Code
will be approved unless it conforms with such ordinance.
   (B)   Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or
dimensions noted herein and those contained in the Zoning Code, Building Code,
or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.065 CENTRAL WATER AND SANITARY SEWER FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED.
   The subdivider shall connect each lot to the village public water and
sanitary sewer system and provide connections to each lot in accord with the
rules and regulations of the Board of Public Affairs.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
§ 153.066 HANDICAPPED ACCESS.
   Whenever curb and gutter construction is used on public streets, wheelchair
ramps for the handicapped shall be provided at intersections and other major
points of pedestrian flow. Wheelchair ramps and depressed curbs shall be
constructed in accordance with published standards of the Ohio Department of
Transportation.
(Ord. 92.019, passed 8-13-1992)
DEVELOPMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL APPROVAL
§ 153.080 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   The following improvements are required before final plat approval or the
subdivider shall furnish a guarantee as set forth in this chapter.
   (A)   Monuments.
      (1)   Concrete monuments four inches in diameter or square, three feet
long, with flat top, shall be set at all street corners, at all points where
the street lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision, at angle
points and points of curbs of the street right-of-way line, and at all corners
on the plat. The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to identify
properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished grade. Concrete
monuments of different construction may be permitted upon written approval of
the Planning Commission or its authorized engineer.
      (2)   All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pipe not less than
five-eights inches in diameter and 30 inches long and driven so as to be flush
with the finished grade or other as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Before final acceptance of the street improvements by the village,
the subdivider, or developer shall, through a registered surveyor, certify to
the village that all required monuments are in place or that those removed
during construction have been replaced.
   (B)   Grading specifications. All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded
to their full widths by the subdivider so that pavements and sidewalks can be
constructed. The subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetative or organic matter,
soft clay, and other objectionable materials for a depth of at least two feet
below the finished surface. The subgrade shall be properly rolled, shaped, and
compacted, and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission’s
authorized engineer.
   (C)   Storm drainage. 
      (1)   An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches or
squalls, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, and the
like, shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water. This
system shall be based on State Department of Transportation standards and
subject to approval of the Planning Commission’s authorized engineer.
      (2)   Where an adequate public storm sewer main is available at the plat
boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and connect with
such storm sewer main. A storm sewer system shall be constructed whenever curbs
and gutters are required.
   (D)   Pavement specification for streets. Other than the following minimum
standards, the base and surface courses of streets shall be constructed in
accordance with the designated specifications as set forth by the current
Construction and Material Specifications of the Ohio Department of
Transportation.

facilities. The site(s) selected for these uses should be situated near
residential neighborhoods or the rural countryside and separated from the
traffic of retail, wholesale, and industrial areas in the village.
   (J)   B-3 Neighborhood Business. For establishment of areas for convenient
business uses which tend to meet the daily needs of the residents in the
general vicinity. These districts shall be located on streets providing safe
and adequate access.
   (K)   B-4 Community Business. For the concentration of a broad range of
individual commercial establishments which together constitute an area of
general commercial activity. Auto oriented uses such as service stations,
automobile dealerships, gas service stations, automobile dealerships, and heavy
equipment services should be restricted in order to protect the compatibility
of uses within the district and preserve the character and aesthetics of the
district. The central business district and/or shopping centers are the
preferred locations.
   (L)   B-5 Community Service Business. Intended primarily for service,
repair, and certain processing establishments that serve the entire community.
Potential sites should generally be situated along major highways and located
in areas where compatible uses can be developed with minimal adverse effects on
each other, on surrounding land uses, and on local traffic flows.
   (M)   I-1 Restricted Industrial. For those industrial uses which can be
compatibly operated within or in very close proximity to residential areas.
These establishments should be clean; quiet, void of such nuisances as odor,
dust, and smoke; operate primarily within enclosed structures; and generate
little industrial traffic.
   (N)   I-2 General Industrial. For those industrial uses generally requiring
large sites and an extensive range of services and facilities, including
adequate access to highly developed and integrated transportation facilities.
Industrial uses in this classification typically operate from enclosed
structures and often maintain large open storage and service areas where part
of the production process may take place.
   (O)   PD Planned Development. For projects that may be unique or that would
not normally be provided for in other districts. Such projects may include
residential projects, recreational complexes, and commercial or industrial
centers. Such projects would be built only in accord with plans approved by the
Village Council after public hearings and extensive review.
   (P)   MH Mobile Home Parks. For mobile home parks approved by the village
and designed in accordance with the rules of the Ohio Department of Health.

§ 154.057 STREAM AND RIPARIAN OVERLAY ZONE.
   All rivers and streams shown on the U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps as a blue line
shall be subject to these overlay requirements. Such stream locations may be
field verified, and modified as necessary by the Service Director in
consultation with the Planning Commission.
   (A)   Intention of the River and Stream Overlay Zone. A strip of land
adjacent to a stream or river retained in its natural vegetation or re-
vegetated/reforested with appropriate perennial vegetation to avoid erosion
problems will reduce the velocity of overland water flow, trap sediment, and
eroded soil from cropland or land being developed and limit other pollutants
from entering the waterway.
   (B)   Standards applicable to all development. The following text shall
apply to all development, subdivision of land, or changing of conditions
adjacent to a perennial stream.
      (1)   A 50-foot stream buffer zone shall be established on both sides of
all perennial streams and watercourses indicated as a solid blue line on the
U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps along with all current and/or future designated
floodways and flood-fringe areas as defined and/or determined by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). No development of any kind, including the
placement of all structures and all soil-disturbing activities, shall occur
within this buffer strip zone except as listed below.
      (2)   As development occurs in any area/zone subject to subdivision or
planning review, an enlarged stream buffer shall be made as follows. The size
of a stream buffer shall be measured from the annual average stream banks
perpendicularly for a distance of 50 feet plus four times the average percent
of slope of area adjacent to the stream. This slope shall be calculated by
measuring a distance of 250 feet from the center of the stream. However, the
maximum distance shall not exceed 120 feet from the edge of the stream.
      (3)   Open space reserves in subdivisions or developments should be
located to maximize the preservation of the riparian corridors.
      (4)   Generally, stream buffer areas within this overlay zone shall
remain undisturbed. When agricultural soil disturbing activities such as
plowing, grading, ditching, excavating, placement of fill materials, or similar
activities must occur, they shall conform to all state and federal regulations.
Other unnamed agricultural activities that would result in significant
disturbance of the existing soil, increase erosion, or destroy plant and
wildlife habitats are prohibited and can only occur with an approved
replacement program consistent with Ohio Department of Natural Resources
standards.
      (5)   Permitted activities/uses within the buffer areas include sewer
easements; providing the activities strictly adhere to applicable state,
federal, and local soil and erosion control regulations and guidelines.
Permanent appropriate native perennial vegetation must be established as a
necessary step in completing the construction of any sewer facilities. Sewer
easements should be as close to perpendicular to the stream channel to minimize
the impact on the stream buffer. Other overhead and/or underground utilities,
roads, streets, bridges, trails, railways, or similar structures would be
placed within existing rights-of-way or existing corridors (whether active or
abandoned) if possible, but in any case, must cross the buffer as close to
perpendicular as possible.
      (6)   All disturbed areas within the buffer zone shall be re-vegetated
with permanent appropriate native perennial vegetation immediately after the
disturbance. Including the re-forestation of forest areas with more mature
growth as detailed by the Service Director or Planning Commission.

§ 154.072 EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD.
   Any lot of record existing at the effective date of this chapter and held in
separate ownership different from the ownership of adjoining lots may be used
for the erection of permitted and conditional uses even though its area and
width are less than the minimum requirements of this chapter, but only to the
extent granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Conditional uses, however, must
receive approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, only after a public hearing.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.073 LOT REVIEW BY COUNTY BOARD OF HEALTH.
   (A)   Prior to issuance of any zoning permit for any residential,
commercial, industrial, public, or semi-public structure when central water
and/or sewage disposal facilities are not available or not used, the County
Board of Health shall be requested to establish the minimum lot area for any
permitted or conditional uses in all districts, but in no case shall the lot
area be less than those specified in Table I or Table II for the various
districts (see §§
154.070 and
154.071).
   (B)   If in the opinion of the County Board of Health, the development of
any such lot or lots, regardless of size, would lead to the creation of a
serious health threat, then all zoning permits for such lot or lots shall be
withheld and development not permitted until and unless an agreement for
appropriate health safeguards can be reached between the owner or his or her
agent, the Village Council, and the County Board of Health.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.074 APPLICATION OF YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Lots which abut on more than one street shall provide the required
front yards along every street.
   (B)   Structures and accessory structures, whether open or closed, such as
garages, carports, porches, balconies, or platforms above grade level, shall be
considered a part of the structure to which they are attached and shall not
project into any required front, side, or rear yards except as permitted in
this chapter.
   (C)   When the rear lot line is adjacent to any alley, garage, and other
accessory structure may be constructed in the required rear yard but shall not
be closer than five feet from the side lot line without the written permission
of the adjacent neighborhood property owner.
   (D)   Yard requirements shall not apply to steps, overhanging eaves, and
cornices; however, these portions of buildings shall not project over any
property line or street right-of-way.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.075 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR USES IN I-1/RESTRICTED INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Night operation. No building customarily used for night operation
shall have any opening, other than stationary windows or required fire exits,
within 200 feet of any R District, and any space used for loading or unloading
of commercial vehicles in connection with any such operation shall not be
within 150 feet of any R District.
   (B)   Offensive uses prohibited. No use shall be permitted or authorized to
be established or maintained, which, when conducted under adequate conditions
and safeguards in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and any
additional conditions or requirements prescribed by the Council or Board of
Zoning Appeals, is or may become hazardous, noxious, or offensive due to
emission of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas fumes, noise, vibration, heat
frequency, refuse, matter, or carried waste.
   (C)   Enclosure required. Any use permitted in the I-1 District shall be
entirely enclosed for its primary operation except for open storage, service
areas, and loading docks.
   (D)   Screening required. Open storage, service areas, and loading docks
shall be screened by walls or fences at least six feet, but not more than eight
feet in height. These walls or fences shall have an opaqueness of 75% or more,
so as to effectively conceal open storage, service, and loading operations from
adjoining streets and from any residential district.
   (E)   Nuisance requirements. In addition to the above any use or structure
in the I-1, Restricted Industrial District shall meet all requirements of §
154.090.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
SPECIAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.090 PUBLIC NUISANCES PROHIBITED.
   No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any manner
creating dangerous, injurious, noxious, or otherwise objectionable conditions
which could adversely affect the surrounding areas or adjoining premises,
except that any use permitted by this chapter may be undertaken and maintained
if acceptable measures and safeguards to reduce dangerous and objectionable
conditions to acceptable limits as established by the following performance
requirements.
   (A)   Fire hazards. Any activity involving the use or storage of flammable
or explosive materials shall be protected by adequate firefighting and fire
prevention equipment and by such safety devices as are normally used in the
handling of any such material. Such hazards shall be kept removed from adjacent
activities to a distance which is compatible with the potential danger
involved.
   (B)   Radioactivity or electrical disturbance. No activity shall emit
dangerous radioactivity at any point, or electrical disturbance adversely
affecting the operation of any equipment at any point other than that of the
creator of such disturbance.
   (C)   Noise. Noise shall be so controlled that at the property line on which
such noise is produced, it will not be at a level above that normally
perceptible from other development at the street right-of-way line on the lot,
except occasional blast required in normal operation and produced in such
manner as not to create a hazard. If such blast or other noise creates an
objectionable noise as determined by the Village Council, such noise shall be
muffled or otherwise controlled. Sirens and related apparatus used solely for
public purposes are exempt from this regulation.
   (D)   Vibration. No vibration shall be permitted which is discernible
without instruments on any adjoining lot or property.
   (E)   Air pollution. No pollution of air by fly-ash, dust, vapors, odors,
smoke, or other substances shall be permitted which are harmful to health,
animals, vegetation, or other property, or which can cause excessive soiling.
   (F)   Glare. No direct or reflected glare shall be permitted which is
visible from any property outside an industrial district or from any street.
   (G)   Erosion. No erosion, by either wind or water, shall be permitted which
will carry objectionable substances onto neighboring properties.
   (H)   Water pollution. No pollution of any stream, reservoir, aquifer
(underground water supply), or other water body within or surrounding the
village, shall be permitted which would create a serious threat to the health,
safety, or welfare of the residents of the village.
   (I)   Litter. Litter constituting a detriment to public health which has
been placed on any property shall be removed. Litter includes any garbage,
waste, peelings of vegetables or fruit, rubbish, ashes, cans, bottles, wire,
paper, boxes, parts of automobiles, furniture, glass, or oil of an unsightly or
unsanitary nature, or anything else of an unsightly or unsanitary nature.
   (J)   Junk. Junk such as abandoned vehicles, household appliances, farm
equipment, or any other matter, for which no future use is contemplated, or
which has deteriorated to the point of creating a visual blight on the
landscape shall be removed from the view from any public road or right-of-way.
   (K)   Storage containers. No metal storage containers of any kind including,
but not limited to, metal box containers or shipping containers, shall be used
as a garage or permanent storage facility or building within the village.
   (L)   Enforcement provisions. The Code Enforcement Officer or Village
Council, prior to the issuance of a zoning permit, may require the submission
of statements and plans indicating the manner in which dangerous and
objectionable elements involved in processing and in equipment operations are
to be eliminated or reduced to acceptable limits and tolerance. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall investigate all complaints, if the Code Enforcement
Officer finds a property in violation of this subchapter, he or she shall give
a written notice by registered mail or in person to the owner or person in
charge of the property requiring him or her to remove the nuisance within 15
days (30 days for dilapidated structures) of receipt of the notice. If the
nuisance is not removed within this period, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
hire someone to remove the nuisance and bill the owner or person in charge of
the property for the cost of the labor and any materials used. If the bill is
not paid, it will be added to the tax duplicate of such property.
   (M)   Measurement procedures. Methods and procedures of the village for the
determination of the existence of any dangerous or objectionable elements which
constitute a public nuisance may utilize any applicable and reliable
measurement procedures or the village may request the assistance of reputable
consultants, government organizations, or other sources if authorized by the
Village Council.
   (N)   Existing public nuisances subject to discretion of Council. Any public
nuisance as described in this chapter and existing at the time of its adoption
shall be subject to the discretion of Village Council prior to any action on
the part of the village to abate or take any other action against such public
nuisance. In the utilization of such discretion, the Council shall determine
what reasonable action, if any, should be taken by the village to bring about
the partial or total abatement of such public nuisance in question.

requirements of this chapter since these matters shall be regulated by the Ohio
Health Department regulations.
   (F)   Mobile homes are prohibited except as provided in this section. No
person shall park or occupy any mobile home or double wide mobile home, or any
manufactured unit, on any premises in any district outside an approved mobile
home park. The parking of an unoccupied mobile home in an accessory private
garage building shall be permitted in any district; provided no living quarters
shall be maintained or any business conducted in such mobile home while so
parked or stored.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.092 INDUSTRIALIZED UNIT HOUSING.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
154.091, industrialized unit housing as defined under §
154.013 is permitted or conditionally permitted in residential and other zoning
districts according to the particular requirements pertaining to each or any
zoning district as stated elsewhere in this chapter and as further required
herein.
   (A)   The building lot and the industrialized unit home must meet all of the
other zoning, building, and service requirements of the village, similar to a
site built dwelling unit.
   (B)   The industrialized unit home shall not otherwise be classified or
defined as either a mobile home or double wide mobile home (see §
154.013).
   (C)   The industrialized unit home shall be permanently attached to a
masonry foundation similar in both construction and appearance to a
conventional site built dwelling unit.
   (D)   The industrialized unit home shall require no additional skirting or
underpinning of a style, or type customarily associated with or used on mobile
homes.
   (E)   The industrialized unit home shall be approved by the state under the
applicable State Building Code reference. State building approval must be
demonstrated at the time of application for a zoning permit. Industrialized
unit homes not approved by the state will not be permitted.
   (F)   A zoning permit must be obtained by the applicant as required
elsewhere in this chapter before any construction is started and before any
industrialized unit home is moved to the building site.
   (G)   The industrialized unit homes shall be properly connected to approved
village and other public utilities the same as for any other residential
dwelling structure.
   (H)   The industrialized unit home shall not be occupied until the home is
fully erected on a permanent foundation and otherwise fully assembled and
permanently connected to approved utilities, and until such time as all other
conditions of occupancy are met.
   (I)   The industrialized unit home shall not be less than 20 feet wide and
30 feet long (exterior dimensions) and shall not be less than 850 square feet
(by exterior dimensions).

154.204(G)). Portable toilets for construction workers and other such small
structures shall not require a temporary use approval by the Board.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.094 MINERAL EXTRACTION, STORAGE, AND PROCESSING, INCLUDING OIL AND GAS
WALLS.
   (A)   Extraction, storage, and processing of minerals of all types shall be
allowed only in those districts where expressly permitted, except the
extraction and storage of sand or gravel on farms of five acres or more shall
be exempt when such sand or gravel is for use on such farm.
   (B)   Mineral extraction, storage, or processing shall not be conducted
closer than 200 feet from any structure used for human occupancy.
   (C)   The operator shall file with the Code Enforcement Officer a location
map which clearly shows areas to be mined and the location of adjacent
properties, roads, and natural features.
   (D)   The operator shall submit information on the anticipated depth of

and the location of future roads, drives, drainage courses, or other
improvements contemplated.
   (F)   The operator shall file, unless exempted by the Village Council, with
the village a bond, payable to the village and conditioned on the faithful
performance of all requirements contained in the approved restoration plan. The

village’s designated inspector that the restoration is complete and in
compliance with the restoration plan. State bonding shall be acceptable in lieu
of village bonding when applicable as determined by Council or law.

(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.204 POWERS AND DUTIES OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals where it
is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Code Enforcement Officer in the enforcement of this chapter.
      (2)   There shall be a fee of $250 for any appeal of actions by the Code
Enforcement Officer. If such appeal is won by the applicant, the fee for the
required zoning permit which must be obtained after winning any appeal shall be
waived, and the zoning permit shall be issued by the Code Enforcement Officer.
      (3)   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person,
firm, or corporation, or by any officer or Board of the village, deeming
himself, herself, or itself to be adversely affected by the decision of the
Code Enforcement Officer respecting the interpretation of the ordinance.
Appeals shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the
grievance.
      (4)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Code Enforcement Officer whose decision is appealed
from shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal
has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in his or her opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court having lawful jurisdiction.
      (5)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make a decision on the appeals
within ten days after the public hearing, unless additional time is necessary
because of unusual circumstances. At the hearing, any party may appear in
person or by attorney.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   Where there are practical difficulties of unnecessary hardship in
the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter, the Board of Appeals
shall have the power in passing an appeal to vary or modify any of the
provisions of this chapter, except granting uses or structures which are not
permitted or conditionally permitted in the district in question so that the
spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety secured, and the
substantial justice done.
      (2)   In every instance of granting a variance by the Board of Appeals,
there must be a showing by the Board that one of the following applies:
         (a)   The strict application or the provisions of the ordinance would
result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship inconsistent with the
central purpose and the intent of this chapter;
         (b)   There are exceptional and extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the property involved or to the intended use or
development of the property that do not apply generally to other properties or
uses in the same zoning district or neighborhood; or
         (c)   The granting of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to the public interest or to the property or improvements in the
district in which the variance is sought and will not materially impair the
purpose or intent of this chapter.
      (3)   In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit such
modification of the yard or lot area or width regulation as may be necessary to
secure the appropriate improvement of a parcel of land that is too small to be
appropriately improved without such modification; provided the parcel was
separately owned at the time of passage of this chapter or is adjacent to
buildings that does not conform to the general restrictions applicable to their
location.
      (4)   In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such
conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health, safety, or
welfare, and to further the purpose and intent of this chapter. These
conditions shall be made a part of and be attached to the required zoning
permit.
      (5)   The fee for a variance shall be $250 which shall be paid at the
time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be obtained after
approval of any variance, shall be waived, and the zoning permit issued by the
Code Enforcement Officer.
   (C)   Conditional uses. 
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and determine all
conditional uses that are specifically listed within the various districts.
Conditional uses, although often desirable, will more intensely affect the
surrounding area in which they are located than the permitted uses of such
districts. Since this is the case, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve an
application for a conditional use only when the following conditions are met:
         (a)   The conditional use is specifically listed or interpreted as
listed in the district in question;
         (b)   The conditional use is in general accord with any adopted
village plans; and
         (c)   The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing
land use character and physical development potential of the area and will not
have undesirable effects on the surrounding area.
      (2)   In granting a conditional use, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare and to further the purpose and intent of this chapter.
      (3)   The fee for a conditional use shall be $250 which shall be paid at
the time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be obtained
after approval of any conditional use shall be waived, and the zoning permit
issued by the Code Enforcement Officer.
   (D)   Exception.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to grant
exceptions. An exception is a use permitted only after review of an application
by the Board of Zoning Appeals, such review being necessary because the
provisions of this chapter covering conditions, precedent or subsequent, are
not precise enough or are too general to cover all applications without the
Board of Zoning Appeals interpretation. In granting an exception, the Board may
impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare and to further the purpose and intent of this chapter. The
Board shall not, however, have the right to change the intent of this chapter
by permitting any use that cannot be reasonably interpreted as intended in the
district in question.
      (2)   The fee for an exception shall be $250 which shall be paid at the
time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be obtained after
approval of any exception shall be waived, and the zoning permit issued by the
Code Enforcement Officer.
   (E)   Interpretation of zoning map. Where the street or lot laid out
actually on the ground, or as recorded differs from the street and lot lines as
shown on the zoning map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property,
shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of
this chapter. No fee shall be charged for an interpretation of the zoning map.
   (F)   Nonconforming uses. 
      (1)   The Board shall have the power to permit changes and extensions of
nonconforming uses as follows:
         (a)   A nonconforming use of a less objectionable nature may be
substituted for an existing nonconforming use;
         (b)   An existing, legal nonconforming use which occupies only a
portion of an existing structure or premises may be extended throughout such
structure or premises;
         (c)   The alteration or reconstruction of a nonconforming use or
building; provided that such will make the nonconforming use substantially more
in character with its surroundings; and
         (d)   The extension of a nonconforming use when such extension will
substantially make the nonconforming use more in character with its
surroundings. Such extensions shall not be greater than 50% of the size of the
nonconforming use that existed at the time of passage of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board may impose such requirements and conditions as they may
deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public
interests. The fee for a nonconforming use change shall be $250 which shall be
paid at the time of application.
      (3)   The fee for the zoning permit which must be obtained after approval
of any nonconforming use change shall be waived, and the zoning permit issued
by the Code Enforcement Officer.
   (G)   Temporary uses.
      (1)   The temporary use of a building or premises such as a construction
office in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed by this chapter for the district in which it is located
may be granted when determined justifiable by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Portable toilets for construction and other such small structures shall not
require a temporary use approval by the Board.
      (2)   Such temporary use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and
revocable permit for not more than a 12-month period subject to such conditions
as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.
      (3)   The fee for a temporary use shall be $50 which shall be paid at the
time of application. The fee for the zoning permit which must be obtained after
approval of any temporary use shall be waived, and the zoning permit issued by
the Code Enforcement Officer.

conditional use, exception, or nonconforming use, prior to a public hearing.
(Ord. 2023.007, passed 7-13-2023)
§ 154.206 NOTICE OF HEARING BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
