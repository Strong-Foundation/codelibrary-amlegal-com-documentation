the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
(R.C. § 1.14)
      (3)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, such priority shall be

that authority to a majority of the officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority, or is
inconsistent with state law.
   (G)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
contains any express provision excluding the construction, or when the subject
matter or context of the law is repugnant thereto.
§ 10.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the by-law
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

provided in division (C) below:

thereunder;

incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the by-law had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a reenactment or amendment of a by-law, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the by-law as
amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   A by-law which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior by-law and not a new enactment, so far as it is the
same as the prior by-law.
(R.C. § 1.54)
§ 10.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, such reference shall be construed to
mean a violation of any provision of the section or sections included in the
reference.

designated sections of the codified by-laws include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, chapters, or sections of the codified
by-laws conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be so construed as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
§ 10.07  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of these codified by-laws or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08  REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the park district exercising the powers,
duties, or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any
transfer of functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error be discovered consisting of the misspelling of any word
or words, the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected, the use of a word or words to which no meaning can
be attached, or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express the intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and
the word or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the
manifest intention, and the provision shall have the same effect as though the
correct words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration
shall be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or
extent of such error.

date of this code of by-laws.

pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of by-laws,
shall remain in full force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by
necessary implication.
§ 10.12  BY-LAWS SAVED.
   Whenever a by-law by its nature either authorizes or enables the Board of
Park Commissioners, or a certain park district officer or employee, to make
additional by-laws or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the intention
of the by-law, all by-laws and regulations of a similar nature serving the
purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent thereto, shall
remain in effect, and are saved.
§ 10.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   (A)   Where an act or omission is prohibited or declared unlawful in this
code of by-laws, and no penalty of fine or imprisonment is otherwise provided,
the offender shall be fined not more than $150 for a first offense and not more
than $1,000 for each subsequent offense.

previously has been convicted or has pleaded guilty to a felony.
      (2)   (a)   The Board of Park Commissioners shall terminate the
employment of an employee designated as provided in division (A) if the

as provided in division (A) of this section if the employee is convicted, after
trial, of a felony. If the employee files an appeal from that conviction and
the conviction is upheld by the highest court to which the appeal is taken or
if the employee does not file a timely appeal, the Board shall terminate the
employment of that employee. If the employee files an appeal that results in
the employee’s acquittal of the felony or conviction of a misdemeanor, or in
the dismissal of the felony charge against the employee, the Board shall
reinstate that employee. An employee who is reinstated under this division (B)
shall not receive any back pay unless that employee’s conviction of the felony

prior to January 1, 1995.

§ 1545.01  PARK DISTRICTS CREATED.
   Park districts may be created which include all or a part of the territory
within a county, and the boundary lines of such district shall be so drawn as
not to divide any existing township or municipal corporation within such
county.
§ 1545.02  APPLICATION TO PROBATE JUDGE.
   Application for the creation of a park district shall be made to the probate
judge of the county within which the district is to be located. Such
application shall either be signed by a majority of the electors residing
within the proposed district as determined by the number of electors voting at
the most recent general election within such territory, or, in lieu thereof,
shall be authorized by resolution adopted by the board of county commissioners,
any board of township trustees, or legislative authority of any municipal
corporation within such proposed district. Such application shall state the
name of the proposed district, shall contain an accurate description of the
territory to be included, and shall be accompanied with an accurate map or plat
thereof.
§ 1545.03  NOTICE AND HEARING.
   Upon the filing of the application provided for in R.C. § 1545.02, the
probate judge shall fix a time for the hearing of such application which shall
not be less than twenty nor more than forty days subsequent to the date of the
filing of the application. Such judge shall publish notice of the filing of
such application and the date of hearing thereof in two newspapers of general
circulation within such district, or if there is but one newspaper of general
circulation within such district, in such newspaper. If there is no newspaper
of general circulation within such proposed district, then such judge shall
post such notice in five of the most public places within such proposed
district. Such notice shall be published or posted for a period of not less
than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. The hearing may be
adjourned from time to time upon good cause shown.
§ 1545.04  EVIDENCE - ARGUMENT - JUDGMENT.
   At a hearing on an application for the creation of a park district, evidence
may be taken as in other civil cases in the probate court, and the probate
judge shall hear all arguments for and against the creation of such district.
If he finds that such application is signed or authorized as provided in R.C. §
1545.02, and that the creation of such district will be conducive to the
general welfare, he shall enter an order creating the district under the name
specified in the application.
   The judge may amend or change the limits of the territory described in the
application at the time of the hearing, provided that in no case shall he
increase the limits or size of said district. In case any of the original
territory is eliminated from the district as finally established, the boundary
lines of the district as finally ordered by the court shall not divide any
existing township or municipal corporation.
§ 1545.041  CONVERSION OF TOWNSHIP PARK DISTRICT - RESOLUTION.
   (A)   Any township park district created pursuant to R.C. § 511.18 that
includes park land located outside the township in which the park district was
established may be converted under the procedures provided in this section into
a park district to be operated and maintained as provided for in this chapter,
provided that there is no existing park district created under R.C. § 1545.04
in the county in which the township park district is located. The proposed park
district shall include within its boundary all townships and municipal
corporations in which lands owned by the township park district seeking
conversion are located, and may include any other townships and municipal
corporations in the county in which the township park district is located.
   (B)   Conversion of a township park district into a park district operated
and maintained under this chapter shall be initiated by a resolution adopted by
the board of park commissioners of the park district. Any resolution initiating

      (2)   The name of the proposed park district;
      (3)   An accurate description of the territory to be included in the
proposed district;
      (4)   An accurate map or plat of the proposed park district. The
resolution may also include a proposed tax levy for the operation and
maintenance of the proposed park district. If such a tax levy is proposed, the
resolution shall specify the annual rate of the tax, expressed in dollars and
cents for each one hundred dollars of valuation and in mills for each dollar of
valuation, and shall specify the number of consecutive years the levy will be
in effect. The annual rate of such a tax may not be higher than the total
combined millage of all levies then in effect for the benefit of the township
park district named in the resolution.
   (C)   Upon adoption of the resolution provided for in division (B) of this
section, the board of park commissioners of the township park district seeking
conversion under this section shall certify the resolution to the board of
elections of the county in which the park district is located no later than
four p.m. of the seventy-fifth day before the day of the election at which the
question will be voted upon. Upon certification of the resolution to the board,
the board of elections shall make the necessary arrangements to submit the
question of conversion of the township park into a park district operated and
maintained under R.C. Chapter 1545, to the electors qualified to vote at the
next primary or general election who reside in the territory of the proposed
park district. The question shall provide for a tax levy if such a levy is
specified in the resolution.
   (D)   The ballot submitted to the electors as provided in division (C) of
this section shall contain the following language:
      Shall the . . . . . . . . (name of the township park district seeking
conversion) be converted into a park district to be operated and maintained

municipal corporations:
      (name townships and municipal corporations)
      Approval of the proposed conversion will result in the termination of all
existing tax levies voted for the benefit of . . . . . . . . (name of the
township park district sought to be converted) and in the levy of a new tax for
the operation and maintenance of . . . . . . . (name of proposed park district)
at a rate not exceeding . . . . . (number of mills) mills for each one dollar
of valuation, which is . . . . . (rate expressed in dollars and cents) for each
one hundred dollars of valuation, for . . . (number of years the millage is to
be imposed) years, commencing on the . . . . (year) tax duplicate.
      FOR THE PROPOSED CONVERSION
      AGAINST THE PROPOSED CONVERSION
   (E)   If the proposed conversion is approved by at least a majority of the
electors voting on the proposal, the township park district that seeks
conversion shall become a park district subject to R.C. Chapter 1545 effective
the first day of January following approval by the voters. The park district
shall have the name specified in the resolution, and effective the first day of
January following approval by the voters, the following shall occur:
      (1)   The indebtedness of the former township park district shall be
assumed by the new park district;
      (2)   All rights, assets, properties, and other interests of the former
township park district shall become vested in the new park district, including

district; provided, that all tax levies in excess of the ten mill limitation
approved for the benefit of the former township park district shall be removed
from the tax lists after the February settlement next succeeding the
conversion. Any tax levy approved in connection with the conversion shall be
certified as provided in R.C. § 5705.25.
      (3)   The members of the board of park commissioners of the former
township park district shall be the members of the members of the board of park
commissioners of the new park district, with all the same powers and duties as
if appointed under R.C. § 1545.05. The term of each such commissioner shall
expire on the first day of January of the year following the year in which his
term would have expired under R.C. § 511.19. Thereafter, commissioners shall be
appointed pursuant to R.C. § 1545.05.
§ 1545.05  PARK COMMISSIONERS.
   (A)   Upon the creation of a park district, the probate judge shall appoint
three commissioners who shall take office immediately and whose terms shall
expire one, two, and three years, respectively, from the first day of January
next after the date of their appointment. Thereafter, their successors shall be
appointed by the probate judge for terms of three years. Before entering upon
the performance of the duties of the office, each commissioner shall take an
oath to perform faithfully the duties of the office and shall give bond for
that faithful performance in the sum of five thousand dollars. The bond shall
be approved by and filed with the county auditor. The commissioners shall serve
without compensation, but shall be allowed their actual and necessary expenses
incurred in the performance of their duties.
   (B)   Any board of park commissioners of a park district may elect to expand
the membership of the board from three members to five members upon a majority
vote of the board. Upon such a vote, the board shall certify to the probate
judge a resolution requesting the judge to appoint two additional members to
the board. The probate judge shall appoint those additional members, and they
shall take office immediately upon their appointment. One member shall be
appointed to a term that expires on the first day of January of the year
following the year of that member’s appointment, and one member shall be
appointed to a term that expires on the first day of January of the second year
following the year of that member’s appointment. Thereafter, their successors
shall be appointed by the probate judge for terms of three years.
§ 1545.06  REMOVAL OF PARK COMMISSIONERS - VACANCY.

either upon complaint filed with such judge or upon his own motion. No such
removal shall be made without giving such commissioner not less than ten days’
notice and a full opportunity to be heard in his own behalf in a public
hearing. The order removing such commissioner shall state the reasons therefor
and shall be entered upon the records of the probate court. In case of such
removal, or in case of other vacancy in the office of commissioner, the vacancy
shall be filled by the judge by appointment for the unexpired term.
§ 1545.07  BOARD OF PARK COMMISSIONERS - EMPLOYEES.
   The commissioners appointed in accordance with R.C. § 1545.05 or pursuant to

consulting, and other special services, including, in accordance with R.C. §
309.09(D), the legal services of the prosecuting attorney of the county in

or employee pays any amount by which the cost of the plan chosen by the officer
or employee exceeds the cost of the plan offered by the board under this
section;
   (B)   Change the choice made under division (A) of this section at a time
each year as determined in advance by the board.
   Any appointed member of the board of park commissioners and the spouse and
dependent children of the member may be covered, at the option and expense of
the member, as a noncompensated employee of the park district under any benefit
plan described in division (A) of this section. The member shall pay to the
park district the amount certified to it by the benefit provider as the
provider’s charge for the coverage the member has chosen under division (A) of
this section. Payments for coverage shall be made, in advance, in a manner
prescribed by the board. The member’s exercise of an option to be covered under
this section shall be in writing, announced at a regular public meeting of the
board, and recorded as a public record in the minutes of the board.

§ 1545.072  BOARD MAY AUTHORIZE USE OF PARK DISTRICT CREDIT CARD.
   (A)   Not later than three months after the effective date of this
amendment, a board of park commissioners of a park district that holds a credit
card account on the effective date of this amendment shall adopt a written
policy for the use of credit card accounts. Otherwise, a board shall adopt a

The policy shall include provisions addressing all of the following:
      (1)   The officers, positions, or appointees authorized to use park
district credit card accounts;
      (2)   The types of expenses for which a credit card account may be used;
      (3)   The procedure for acquisition, use, and management of a credit card
account and presentation instruments related to the account including cards and
checks;
      (4)   The procedure for submitting itemized receipts to the treasurer or
the treasurer's designee;
      (5)   The procedure for credit card issuance, credit card reissuance,
credit card cancellation, and the process for reporting lost or stolen credit
cards;
      (6)   The district's credit card account's maximum credit limit or
limits;
      (7)   The actions or omissions by an officer, employee, or appointee that
qualify as misuse of a credit card account.
   (B)   The name of the park district shall appear on each presentation
instrument related to the account including cards and checks.
   (C)   If the treasurer of the park district does not retain general
possession and control of the credit card account and presentation instruments
related to the account including cards and checks, the board shall appoint a
compliance officer to perform the duties enumerated under division (D) of this
section. The compliance officer may not use a credit card account and may not

treasurer is not eligible for appointment as compliance officer.
   (D)   The compliance officer, if applicable, and the board at least
quarterly shall review the number of cards and accounts issued, the number of
active cards and accounts issued, the cards' and accounts' expiration dates,
and the cards' and accounts' credit limits.
   (E)   If the treasurer retains general possession and control of the credit
card account and presentation instruments related to the account including
cards and checks, and the board authorizes an officer, employee, or appointee
to use a credit card, the treasurer may use a system to sign out credit cards
to the authorized users. The officer, employee, or appointee is liable in
person and upon any official bond the officer, employee, or appointee has given
to the park district to reimburse the district treasury the amount for which
the officer, employee, or appointee does not provide itemized receipts in
accordance with the policy described in division (A) of this section.
   (F)   The use of a credit card account for expenses beyond those authorized
by the board constitutes misuse of a credit card account. An officer, employee,
or appointee of a board of park commissioners or a public servant as defined
under section 2921.01 of the Revised Code who knowingly misuses a credit card
account held by the board violates section 2913.21 of the Revised Code.
   (G)   The treasurer or the treasurer's designee annually shall file a report
with the board detailing all rewards received based on the use of the park
district's credit card account.
   (H)   As used in this section, “credit card account” means any bank-issued
credit card account, store-issued credit card account, financial institution-
issued credit card account, financial depository-issued credit card account,
affinity credit card account, or any other card account allowing the holder to
purchase goods or services on credit or to transact with the account, and any
debit or gift card account related to the receipt of grant moneys. “Credit card
account” does not include a procurement card account, gasoline or telephone
credit card account, or any other card account where merchant category codes
are in place as a system of control for use of the card account.
§ 1545.08  REPORTS OF BOARD OF PARK COMMISSIONERS.
   The board of park commissioners shall compile and publish reports and
information relating to the park district and to the proceedings and functions
of the board. The board shall keep an accurate and permanent public record of

   (A)   The board of park commissioners shall adopt such bylaws and rules as
the board considers advisable for the preservation of good order within and
adjacent to parks and reservations of land, and for the protection and
preservation of the parks, parkways, and other reservations of land under its
jurisdiction and control and of property and natural life therein. The board
shall also adopt bylaws or rules establishing a procedure for contracting for
professional, technical, consulting, and other special services. Any
competitive bidding procedures of the board do not apply to the purchase of
benefits for park district officers or employees when such benefits are
provided through a health and welfare trust fund administered through or in
conjunction with a collective bargaining representative of the park district
employees, as authorized in R.C. § 1545.071. Summaries of the bylaws and rules
shall be published as provided in the case of ordinances of municipal
corporations under R.C. § 731.21 before taking effect.
   (B)   (1)   As used in division (B)(2) of this section, “similar violation
under state law” means a violation of any section of the Revised Code, other
than division (C) of this section, that is similar to a violation of a bylaw or
rule adopted under division (A) of this section.
      (2)   The board of park commissioners may adopt by bylaw a penalty for a
violation of any bylaw or rule adopted under division (A) of this section, and
any penalty so adopted shall not exceed in severity whichever of the following
is applicable:
         (a)   The penalty designated under the Revised Code for a violation of
the state law that is similar to the bylaw or rule for which the board adopted
the penalty;
         (b)   For a violation of a bylaw or rule adopted under division (A) of
this section for which the similar violation under state law does not bear a
penalty or for which there is no similar violation under state law, a fine of
not more than one hundred fifty dollars for a first offense and not more than
one thousand dollars for each subsequent offense.
      (3)   A summary of any bylaw adopted under division (B)(2) of this
section shall be published as provided in the case of ordinances of municipal
corporations under R.C. § 731.21 before taking effect.
   (C)   No person shall violate any bylaws or rules adopted under division (A)
of this section. All fines collected for any violation of this section shall be
paid into the treasury of such park board.
§ 1545.10  CONTRACT WITH CORPORATION OR ASSOCIATION MAINTAINING MUSEUM OF
NATURAL HISTORY.
   The board of park commissioners may contract for a term not exceeding three
years, upon such terms as the board deems expedient, with any private
corporation or association not for profit maintaining a museum of natural
history in any county within which the park district is located in whole or in
part, or which has for its object the promotion of interest in or the
conservation and preservation of the flora or fauna in any portion or all of
the territory comprising the district for the purpose of obtaining for such
district such services and assistance as can be rendered by such corporation or
association.
§ 1545.11  BOARD OF PARK COMMISSIONERS - POWER TO ACQUIRE LANDS.
   The board of park commissioners may acquire lands either within or without
the park district for conversion into forest reserves and for the conservation
of the natural resources of the state, including streams, lakes, submerged

reservations, and other reservations and afforest, develop, improve, protect,
and promote the use of the same in such manner as the board deems conducive to
the general welfare. Such lands may be acquired by such board, on behalf of
said district, (1) by gift or devise, (2) by purchase for cash, by purchase by
installment payments with or without a mortgage, by entering into lease-
purchase agreements, by lease with or without option to purchase, or, (3) by
appropriation. In furtherance of the use and enjoyment of the lands controlled
by it, the board may accept donations of money or other property, or may act as
trustees of land, money, or other property, and use and administer the same as
stipulated by the donor, or as provided in the trust agreement. The terms of
each such donation or trust shall first be approved by the probate court before
acceptance by the board.
   In case of appropriation, the proceedings shall be instituted in the name of
the board, and shall be conducted in the manner provided in R.C. §§ 163.01 to
163.22, inclusive.
   This section applies to districts created prior to April 16, 1920.

dispose of the lands upon terms the board considers advisable. The board also
may lease or permit the use of any lands for purposes not inconsistent with the
purposes for which the lands were acquired, and upon terms the board considers
advisable. No lands shall be sold pursuant to this division without first
giving notice of the board’s intention to sell the lands by publication once a
week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
district or as provided in R.C. § 7.16. The notice shall contain an accurate
description of the lands and shall state the time and place at which sealed
bids will be received for the purchase of the lands, and the lands shall not
thereafter be sold at private sale for less than the best and highest bid
received without giving further notice as specified in this division.
   (B)   (1)   After compliance with division (B)(2) of this section, the board
of park commissioners may sell land upon terms the board considers advisable to
any park district established under R.C. § 511.18 or R.C. Chapter 1545, any
political subdivision of the state, the state or any department or agency of
the state, or any department or agency of the federal government for
conservation uses or for park or recreation purposes without the necessity of
having to comply with division (A) of this section.
      (2)   Before the board of park commissioners may sell land under division
(B)(1) of this section, the board shall offer the land for sale to each of the
following public agencies that is authorized to acquire, develop, and maintain
land for conservation uses or for park or recreation purposes: each park
district established under R.C. § 511.18 or R.C. Chapter 1545 or political
subdivision in which the land is located, each park district that is so
established and that adjoins or each political subdivision that adjoins a park
district so established or political subdivision in which the land is located,
and each agency or department of the state or of the federal government that
operates parks or conservation or recreation areas near the land. The board
shall make the offer by giving a written notice that the land is available for
sale, by first class mail, to these public agencies. A failure of delivery of
the written notice to any of these public agencies does not invalidate any
proceedings for the sale of land under this division. Any public agency that is
so notified and that wishes to purchase the land shall make an offer to the
board in writing not later than sixty days after receiving the written notice.
         If there is only one offer to purchase the land made in that sixty-day
period, the board need not hold a public hearing on the offer. The board shall
accept the offer only if it determines that acceptance of the offer will result
in the best public use of the land.
         If there is more than one offer to purchase the land made in that
sixty-day period, the board shall not accept any offer until the board holds a
public hearing on the offers. If, after the hearing, the board decides to
accept an offer, it shall accept the offer that it determines will result in
the best public use of the land.
   (C)   No lands shall be sold under this section at either public or private
sale without the approval of the probate court of the county in which the lands
are situated.
§ 1545.13  PARK COMMISSION EMPLOYEES DESIGNATED AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
   (A)   As used in this section, “felony” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
109.511.
   (B)   The employees that the board of park commissioners designates for that
purpose may exercise all the powers of police officers within and adjacent to
the lands under the jurisdiction and control of the board or when acting as
authorized by R.C. § 1545.131 or 1545.132. Before exercising the powers of
police officers, the designated employees shall comply with the certification
requirement established in R.C. § 109.77, take an oath, and give a bond to the
state in the sum that the board prescribes, for the proper performance of their
duties in that respect. This division is subject to division (C) of this
section.
   (C)   (1)   The board of park commissioners shall not designate an employee
as provided in division (B) of this section on a permanent basis, on a
temporary basis, for a probationary term, or on other than a permanent basis if
the employee previously has been convicted of or has pleaded guilty to a
felony.
      (2)   (a)   The board of park commissioners shall terminate the
employment of an employee designated as provided in division (B) of this
section if the employee does either of the following:
            (i)   Pleads guilty to a felony;
            (ii)   Pleads guilty to a misdemeanor pursuant to a negotiated plea
agreement as provided in division (D) of R.C. § 2929.43 in which the employee
agrees to surrender the certificate awarded to the employee under R.C. §
109.77.
         (b)   The board shall suspend from employment an employee designated
as provided in division (B) of this section if the employee is convicted, after
trial, of a felony. If the employee files an appeal from that conviction and
the conviction is upheld by the highest court to which the appeal is taken or
if the employee does not file a timely appeal, the board shall terminate the
employment of that employee. If the employee files an appeal that results in
the employee’s acquittal of the felony or conviction of a misdemeanor, or in
the dismissal of the felony charge against the employee, the board shall
reinstate that employee. An employee who is reinstated under division (C)(2)(b)
of this section shall not receive any back pay unless that employee’s
conviction of the felony was reversed on appeal, or the felony charge was
dismissed, because the court found insufficient evidence to convict the
employee of the felony.
      (3)   Division (C) of this section does not apply regarding an offense
that was committed prior to January 1, 1995.
      (4)   The suspension from employment, or the termination of the
employment, of an employee under division (C)(2) of this section shall be in
accordance with R.C. Chapter 119.
§ 1545.131  MUTUAL AID CONTRACTS.
   The board of park commissioners of a park district may enter into contracts
with one or more townships, township police districts, joint police districts,
municipal corporations, or county sheriffs of this state, with one or more
township park districts created pursuant to R.C. § 511.18 or other park
districts, with one or more state universities or colleges, as defined in R.C.
§ 3345.12, or with a contiguous political subdivision of an adjoining state,
and a township, township police district, joint police district, municipal
corporation, county sheriff, township park district, other park district, or
state university or college may enter into a contract with a park district upon
any terms that are agreed to by them, to allow the use of the park district
police or law enforcement officers designated under R.C. § 1545.13 to perform
any police function, exercise any police power, or render any police service on
behalf of the contracting entity that the entity may perform, exercise, or
render.
   R.C. Chapter 2744, insofar as it applies to the operation of police
departments, applies to the contracting entities and to the members of the
police force or law enforcement department when they are rendering service
outside their own subdivisions pursuant to that contract.
   Members of the police force or law enforcement department acting outside the
political subdivision in which they are employed, pursuant to that contract,
shall be entitled to participate in any indemnity fund established by their
employer to the same extent as while acting within the employing subdivision.
Those members shall be entitled to all the rights and benefits of R.C. Chapter
4123, to the same extent as while performing service within the subdivision.
   The contracts entered into pursuant to this section may provide for the
following:
   (A)   A fixed annual charge to be paid at the times agreed upon and
stipulated in the contract;
   (B)   Compensation based upon the following:
      (1)   A stipulated price for each call or emergency;
      (2)   The number of members or pieces of equipment employed;
      (3)   The elapsed time of service required in each call or emergency.
   (C)   Compensation for loss or damage to equipment while engaged in
rendering police services outside the limits of the subdivision that owns and
furnishes the equipment;
   (D)   Reimbursement of the subdivision in which the police force or law
enforcement department members are employed for any indemnity award or premium
contribution assessed against the employing subdivision for workers’
compensation benefits for injuries or death of its police force or law
enforcement department members occurring while engaged in rendering police
services pursuant to the contract.
§ 1545.132  PROVIDING POLICE SERVICE WITHOUT CONTRACT.
   The police force or law enforcement department of any park district may
provide police protection to any county, municipal corporation, township,
township police district, or joint police district of this state, to any other
park district or any township park district created pursuant to R.C. § 511.18,
or to a governmental entity of an adjoining state without a contract to provide
police protection, upon the approval, by resolution, of the board of park
commissioners of the park district in which the police force or law enforcement
department is located and upon authorization by an officer or employee of the
police force or department providing the police protection who is designated by
title of office or position, pursuant to the resolution of the board of park
commissioners, to give the authorization.
   R.C. Chapter 2744, insofar as it applies to the operation of police
departments, shall apply to any park district and to members of its police
force or law enforcement department when those members are rendering police
services pursuant to this section outside the park district by which they are
employed.
   Police force or law enforcement department members acting, as provided in
this section, outside the park district by which they are employed shall be
entitled to participate in any pension or indemnity fund established by their
employer to the same extent as while acting within the park district by which
they are employed. Those members shall be entitled to all rights and benefits
of R.C. Chapter 4123 to the same extent as while performing services within the
park district by which they are employed.
§ 1545.14  AGREEMENT WITH OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES TO ASSUME CONTROL OF PARKS.
   A board of park commissioners may by agreement with the legislative or other
public authority in control of parks or park lands either within or without the
park district, assume control of all or a portion of any existing parks or park
lands or otherwise contract or cooperate with such public authority in
connection with the use, development, improvement, and protection of parks or
park lands. In such event, such parks or park lands may be developed, improved,
and protected as in case of lands otherwise acquired by said board. This
section does not authorize said board to acquire or control any park, park
lands, parkways, playgrounds, other lands, or boulevards owned or controlled by
any other public authority except by agreement as provided in this section.
§ 1545.15  ANNEXATION PROCEDURE.
   When conducive to the general welfare, any territory adjacent and contiguous
to an existing park district, whether located within or without the county in
which such district was created, may be annexed to such district. When a
petition is filed with the board of park commissioners requesting such
annexation, containing an accurate description of the territory proposed to be
annexed, accompanied by an accurate map or plat of such territory, and signed
either by a majority of the electors residing within such territory or by not
less than fifty such electors, the board shall determine whether it is
advisable that such annexation should be made. If the board determines in favor
of such annexation, it shall make application to the probate court of the
county in which such territory is located, setting forth the fact of the filing
of such petition and the reasons why it is advisable that such territory should
be annexed to such district. Any such board may of its motion file such
petition in such court. Upon the filing of such petition, like proceedings
shall be had as are provided in R.C. §§ 1545.03 and 1545.04 upon application
for the creation of a park district, except that the territory so annexed may
include a part only of an existing township or municipal corporation.
§ 1545.16  POWERS OF BUDGET COMMISSIONERS, AUDITORS, AND TREASURERS IN RELATION
TO PARK DISTRICTS.
   In the event of the annexation to a park district of territory located in a
county other than the county in which such district was created, the budget
commissioners of the county in which such annexed territory is located shall
exercise, with reference to such annexed territory, the powers conferred upon
budget commissioners by R.C. § 1545.20, and the county auditor and county
treasurer of the county in which such annexed territory is located shall
exercise, with reference to taxes levied and collected by the board of park
commissioners upon such annexed territory, the powers conferred upon auditors
and treasurers by R.C. § 1545.22.
§ 1545.17  IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC HIGHWAY.
   When a public highway extends into or through a park area, or when a public
highway forms all or part of a suitable connection between two or more park
areas, and it is deemed advisable to make alterations in the route or width of
such highway, or to grade, drain, pave, or otherwise improve such highway,
boards of park commissioners may enter into agreements with the public
authorities in charge or control of so much of said highway as lies within such
park area or which forms the whole or part of a connecting link between two or
more park areas, providing for the doing of any of such things, under the
procedure authorized by law in case of such public authorities, and for the
payment by such boards of so much of the cost thereof as is agreed upon. This
section does not affect the legal status of such highway.
§ 1545.18  ASSESSMENT OF COST OF IMPROVEMENT - COLLECTION.
   In the development and improvement of the lands acquired by a board of park
commissioners, such board may assess such portion of the cost of such
development or improvement as it deems equitable, not to exceed fifty per cent
of such total cost, upon abutting, contiguous, adjacent, or otherwise
specifically benefited lands, in an amount not in excess of and in proportion
to the special benefits conferred upon such lands by such development or
improvement. Such assessment shall be payable in not to exceed ten equal annual
installments, and said board may borrow money in anticipation of the collection
of such special assessments. The proceedings had in the levying and collection
of such special assessments, including the issue of bonds of the park district
in anticipation of the collection of deferred assessments, shall be as provided
in case of the levy and assessment of special assessments for street
improvements in municipal corporations, insofar as such proceedings are
applicable. If any such assessment is twenty-five dollars or less, or whenever
the unpaid balance of any such assessment is twenty-five dollars or less, such
assessment shall be paid in full, and not in installments, at the time when the
first or next installment would otherwise become due and payable.
§ 1545.19  ASSESSMENT MAY BE INCREASED WITH CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS.
   In case of any development or improvement, the assessments authorized by
R.C. § 1545.18 shall not in the aggregate exceed the cost of a development or
improvement sufficient only to serve that need of the property to be assessed,
unless the development or improvement has been petitioned for by the owners of
not less than sixty per cent, both in foot frontage and in tax valuation, of
the property to be assessed, consenting to a larger assessment than provided
for in this section and R.C. § 1545.18, in which event such larger assessment
may be levied to the extent specified in such petition.
   Any owner of property to be assessed in accordance with R.C. § 1545.18 may
appeal to the probate court in the county in which such property is located
from the action of the board of park commissioners in the matter of the
determination of the aggregate amount to be assessed for any given development
or improvement or in the matter of the determination of the assessment against
any specific property, or both, in the manner provided in R.C. §§ 6117.01 to
6117.40, inclusive, and the court may review and modify the action of the board
with respect to such assessments.
§ 1545.20  TAX LEVY.
   A board of park commissioners may levy taxes upon all the taxable property
within the park district in an amount not in excess of one-half of one mill
upon each dollar of the district tax valuation in any one year, subject to the
combined maximum levy for all purposes otherwise provided by law. After the
budget commission of the county in which the district is located certifies such
levy, or such modification thereof as it considers advisable, to the county
auditor, he shall place it upon the tax duplicate. The board may then borrow
money in anticipation of the collection of such tax, and issue the negotiable
notes of such board therefor in an amount not in excess of fifty per cent of
the proceeds of such tax, based upon the amount of the current tax valuation.
Such notes shall not be issued for a period longer than one year, and shall be
payable out of the proceeds of such levy. To the extent of such notes and the
interest which accrues thereon such levy shall be exclusively appropriated to
the payment of such notes. Any portion of such notes remaining unpaid through
any deficiency in such levy shall be payable out of the next ensuing levy which
shall be made by said board in the next ensuing year in an amount at least
sufficient to provide for the payment of said notes, but not in excess of one
half of one mill in accordance with R.C. § 133.17.
§ 1545.21  TAX LEVY FOR USE OF DISTRICT - SUBMISSION TO ELECTORS - BONDS.
   The board of park commissioners, by resolution, may submit to the electors
of the park district the question of levying taxes for the use of the district.
The resolution shall declare the necessity of levying such taxes, shall specify
the purpose for which such taxes shall be used, the annual rate proposed, and
the number of consecutive years the rate shall be levied. Such resolution shall
be forthwith certified to the board of elections in each county in which any
part of such district is located, not later than the ninetieth day before the
day of the election, and the question of the levy of taxes as provided in such
resolution shall be submitted to the electors of the district at a special
election to be held on whichever of the following occurs first:
   (A)   The day of the next general election;
   (B)   The first Tuesday after the first Monday in May in any calendar year,
except that if a presidential primary election is held in that calendar year,
then the day of that election. The ballot shall set forth the purpose for which
the taxes shall be levied, the annual rate of levy, and the number of years of
such levy. If the tax is to be placed on the current tax list, the form of the
ballot shall state that the tax will be levied in the current tax year and
shall indicate the first calendar year the tax will be due. If the resolution
of the board of park commissioners provides that an existing levy will be
canceled upon the passage of the new levy, the ballot may include a statement
that: “an existing levy of ... mills (stating the original levy millage),
having ... years remaining, will be canceled and replaced upon the passage of
this levy”. In such case, the ballot may refer to the new levy as a
“replacement levy” if the new millage does not exceed the original millage of
the levy being canceled or as a “replacement and additional levy” if the new
millage exceeds the original millage of the levy being canceled. If a majority
of the electors voting upon the question of such levy vote in favor thereof,
such taxes shall be levied and shall be in addition to the taxes authorized by
R.C. § 1545.20, and all other taxes authorized by law. The rate submitted to
the electors at any one time shall not exceed two mills annually upon each
dollar of valuation unless the purpose of the levy includes providing operating
revenues for one of Ohio’s major metropolitan zoos, as defined in R.C. §
4503.74, in which case the rate shall not exceed three mills annually upon each
dollar of valuation. When a tax levy has been authorized as provided in this
section or in R.C. § 1545.041, the board of park commissioners may issue bonds
pursuant to R.C. § 133.24 in anticipation of the collection of such levy,
provided that such bonds shall be issued only for the purpose of acquiring and
improving lands. Such levy, when collected, shall be applied in payment of the
bonds so issued and the interest thereon. The amount of bonds so issued and
outstanding at any time shall not exceed one per cent of the total tax
valuation in such district. Such bonds shall bear interest at a rate not to
exceed the rate determined as provided in R.C. § 9.95.
§ 1545.211  ANTICIPATION NOTES.
   In addition to the authority conferred by R.C. § 1545.21, in anticipation of
the collection of current revenues in and for any fiscal year, the board of
park commissioners may borrow money and issue notes therefor in anticipation of
the receipt of taxes for debt charges or current expenses to the extent
necessary to meet such charges or expenses, but not in excess of the estimated
receipts for the current tax year, less all advances. The sums so anticipated
shall be deemed appropriated for the payment of such notes at maturity. The
notes shall not run more than one year, nor bear interest at a rate exceeding
the rate provided in R.C. § 9.95, and the proceeds therefrom shall be used only
for the purposes for which the anticipated taxes were levied. No board shall
borrow money or issue notes in anticipation of such taxes before the first day
of January of the year of such tax receipts.
§ 1545.22  DEPOSITORIES FOR FUNDS - DUTIES OF COUNTY TREASURER AND COUNTY
AUDITOR.
   (A)   If a treasurer is appointed by a board of park commissioners pursuant
to R.C. § 1545.07, the accounts of the board shall be kept by that treasurer.
The treasurer shall be an ex officio officer of the board. No contract of the
board shall become effective until the treasurer certifies that there are funds
of the board sufficient to provide for that contract.
   (B)   If no treasurer is appointed by the board pursuant to R.C. § 1545.07:
      (1)   All funds under the control of a board of park commissioners shall
be kept in depositories selected in the manner provided for the deposit of
county funds, insofar as such proceedings are applicable, and such deposits
shall be secured as provided in the case of county funds. The county treasurer
of the county in which the park district is located shall be the custodian of
the funds of the board and shall be an ex officio officer of the board. He
shall pay the funds out upon the warrant of the county auditor of the county in
which the district is located. Interest earned on all funds under the control
of the board of park commissioners shall be credited to such funds.
      (2)   The county auditor shall be an ex officio officer of the board, and
no contract of the board involving the expenditure of money shall become
effective until the auditor certifies that there are funds of the board in the
custody of the county treasurer and otherwise unappropriated sufficient to
provide therefor. The auditor shall draw warrants on the treasurer to disburse
the funds of the board upon order of the board, evidenced by the certificate of
its secretary.
      (3)   Any such board of park commissioners may select a depository for
the funds of the district, in the manner provided in R.C. §§ 135.01 to 135.21,
upon the adoption of a resolution declaring such intent. The resolution shall
be certified to the board of county commissioners and to the treasurer in the
counties in which the district is located. The board of park commissioners
shall thereupon become the governing board for such district with respect to
the deposit of funds of such district.
   (C)   If no deposits to or expenditures from the funds of a park district
have been made for a period of five years, the county auditor or the treasurer
appointed by the board shall send written notice to the probate court of the
county.
§ 1545.23  DISPOSITION OF PROCEEDS FROM SALE OR LEASE OF PARK MINERAL RIGHTS.
   If a park district enters into an agreement for the sale or lease of mineral
rights regarding a park within the district, any royalties or other moneys
resulting from the sale or lease shall be deposited into a special fund that
the board of park commissioners shall create. The fund shall be used
exclusively for maintenance of parks within the district and for the
acquisition of new park lands.
§ 1545.24  ISSUANCE OF BONDS.
   The board of park commissioners of any park district may issue bonds
pursuant to R.C. Chapter 133 for the purpose of acquiring and improving lands
as authorized by R.C. § 1545.11. The board may secure the payment of such bonds
by pledge or deed of trust of any of its revenues and receipts resulting from
rentals, concessions, licenses, and permits. The board shall not pledge the
credit or taxing power of the district for the payment of any such bonds, nor
shall any of the bonds issued under this section be deemed to be an
indebtedness of the district.

companies, trustees, the boards of trustees of the sinking funds of municipal
corporations, school districts, and counties, the administrator of workers’
compensation, the state teachers retirement system, the public employees
retirement system, and the school employees retirement system, and also are
acceptable as security for the deposit of public moneys.
§ 1545.28  REPLACEMENT FUND.
   The board of park commissioners may establish and maintain a replacement
fund, and for that purpose may set aside annually out of its revenue such sum
as it may determine necessary. In case of total or partial destruction of or
injury to any of the property of the park district from any cause, or in case
it becomes necessary to demolish part or to repair or replace the same, in
whole or in part, because of the unfitness of such property, such replacement
fund may be used to rebuild on the original site or elsewhere, or to restore,
repair, or improve such property.
   Such replacement fund may be invested by such district in bonds of the
United States, the state, or of a county, municipal corporation, school
district, or township of this state, and when necessary for the purposes of
such funds such securities may be disposed of by such district.

§ 1545.35  DISSOLUTION OF ACTIVE PARK DISTRICT.
   An active park district created under this chapter and to which no territory
has been annexed under R.C. § 1545.15 may be dissolved under R.C. § 1545.36 or
1545.37. An active park district to which territory has been annexed under R.C.
§ 1545.15 may be dissolved only under the applicable provisions of R.C. §
1545.37. A park district that has been inactive for five years may be dissolved
under R.C. § 1545.38.
§ 1545.36  PETITION FOR DISSOLUTION OF DISTRICT.
   (A)   When the board of elections of the county in which a park district is
located has had filed with it a petition calling for the dissolution of the
district, and determines that the petition meets the requirements of this
section and R.C. § 3501.38, the board shall place the issue of the dissolution
on the ballot at the next special election to be held on the day of a general
or primary election. Written notice of the filing of the petition shall be sent
immediately to the board of park commissioners and the probate court that
created the district.
   (B)   The petition shall:
      (1)   Be filed with the board no less than ninety days before the next
election;
      (2)   Be supported by the signatures of at least twenty-five per cent of
the number of voters in the district who voted in the preceding gubernatorial
election.
   (C)   If the petition as filed does not have the required number of
signatures and the time for filing has elapsed, the board shall declare it
invalid. No further petition for dissolution shall be received until after the
next election is completed. On determination of these findings, the board shall
send written notice of them to the principal circulator.
   (D)   (1)   If a majority of the votes cast support the dissolution, the
board shall immediately send written notice of the vote, citing the number of
votes for and against the issue, to the probate court, to the board of park
commissioners, and to the principal circulator. No park district shall be
applied for within the dissolved district for a period of four years following
the election in which the issue was supported.
      (2)   If the issue fails to obtain a majority of the votes cast, the
board shall receive no further petition for dissolution until the fourth year
following that in which the election failed, and shall send written notice of
these results to the principal circulator and the board of park commissioners.
§ 1545.37  APPLICATION FOR HEARING ON DISSOLUTION.
   (A)   An application for a hearing on dissolution may be filed with the
probate court of the county that created the district at any time not
prohibited by this section and shall meet the requirements of this section.
   (B)   The application shall:
      (1)   Bear the signatures of at least twenty-five per cent of the number
of voters in the district who voted in the preceding gubernatorial election;
      (2)   Bear the name, address, and telephone number of at least one voter
registered in the district to be designated the applicant of record. Each
applicant of record and the board of park commissioners shall be named parties
to the proceedings.
      (3)   Be accompanied by a complete statement of the issues to be heard,
signed by applicant of record. Failure to list completely the issues to be
heard may, in the discretion of the court, be grounds for dismissal of the
application.
   (C)   Each page of the application:
      (1)   Being circulated for signatures shall clearly state the purpose for
which it is being circulated and at least one reason supporting that purpose.
Each page lacking either statement shall be declared invalid.
      (2)   Shall be circulated by and signed in the presence of a voter
registered in the district and bear a certification signed by him that this
requirement has been met. Failure to certify or a false certification shall
invalidate the page.
   (D)   Each signatory shall sign his name as recorded by the board of
elections together with his current address and the date. Failure to comply
with this division shall invalidate the signature.
   (E)   The original of the application and statement of issues shall be filed
with the court and, concurrently, a copy of each shall be served on the board
of park commissioners. Failure to timely serve these documents on the board are
(is) grounds for denial of the application.
   (F)   Upon receipt of the application, the court shall determine its
validity in terms of the requirements of divisions (B) to (E) of this section,
and may on its own assess the application for validity of the signatures or
forward it to the county board of elections for that assessment. Immediately
upon determining the state of the application’s validity, the court shall send
written notice of its findings to each party. If the application is valid, the
court shall forthwith set a date for hearing, not less than twenty days nor
more than forty days from the date of its findings, and include the date in its
notice to each party. Notice of the hearing shall be published in at least one
daily newspaper of general circulation within the district for not less than
five consecutive days, the period to end no less than ten days before the
hearing. Failure to meet the requirement of notice to any party shall not
invalidate the proceedings but shall postpone the time of hearing. A corrected
notice shall be sent to each party with a new date of hearing set not less than
twenty days nor more than forty days from the date of corrected notice, unless
each party and the court agree to an earlier date. If the application is found
to be invalid, the court shall send written notice to each party that the
application is denied and has been impounded by the court. The court shall not
receive any further application for hearing on dissolution for two years from
the date of original filing.
      On motion, any applicant may be named as a party at the discretion of the
court. Any party may be heard on his own or through counsel. On motion by any
party made at least five days before the hearing, evidence based on the
statement of issues filed with the application shall be heard in accordance
with the Rules of Civil Procedure. At the hearing, evidence may be heard at the
discretion of the court. Argument for and against the dissolution shall be
heard by the court, and may be limited at its discretion. A verbatim record of
the hearing shall be taken. Upon completion of the hearing, the court shall
issue its findings together with its reasons therefor to all parties. No more
than thirty days shall pass between the adjournment of the hearing and the
issuing of the findings. If the court finds that dissolution is conducive to
the public welfare, no other park district shall be created within the same
jurisdiction or part of it pursuant to R.C. §§ 1545.01 to 1545.04 or 1545.15
for four years from the date of finding. If the court finds that dissolution is

on compliance with this division and divisions (A) to (F) of this section.
Pages of the application bearing signatures of registered voters of each
annexed territory shall be filed for assessment of their validity with the
probate court of the county in which the territory is located. The number of
signatures needed to establish validity shall be a majority of the number of
voters residing within the annexed territory who voted in the preceding

validity and proceed in accordance with applicable provisions of division (F)
of this section.
§ 1545.38  PROCEEDINGS FOR DISSOLUTION OF INACTIVE DISTRICT.
   On receipt of written notice from the county auditor that no deposits to or
expenditures from the funds of a park district have been made for a period of
five years, the probate court shall immediately serve written notice on the
board of park commissioners and the auditor of a date for hearing on the
dissolution of the district. The notice shall also order the board to forward
to the court a complete, current financial statement of the assets and
liabilities of the district, an inventory of its real and personal property,
available deeds to, maps or plats for, and other records of real property of
the park district, and copies of any available plans of the district for park
acquisition and development, or capital improvements. A copy of the notice
shall be served on each party. The court shall publish notice of the hearing
for five consecutive days in a daily newspaper of general circulation within
the district, ending no less than fifteen days before the hearing. The issue of
dissolution shall be heard and determined by the court in accordance with the

§ 1545.39  CEASING ACTIVITY PENDING DETERMINATION ON PETITION.
   On receipt of notice of the filing of a petition with the county board of
elections or an application for hearing or a notice of hearing from the probate
court, the board of park commissioners shall cease all acquisition of land and
the development of existing land unless valid options or contracts for which
funds have been committed have been previously signed. No activity shall be
resumed until the board of elections or the court determines, respectively,
that the petition or application is invalid and the issue will not be voted on
or heard, or the issue fails election, or the court finds against dissolution,
whichever is earlier.
§ 1545.40  DISSOLUTION.
   On dissolution of a park district, the board of park commissioners is
dissolved and all of its duties and responsibilities shall be exercised by the
probate court until all of the board’s business is completed and all of its
property disposed of. The court may retain special counsel and another person
who in the court’s discretion are qualified to assist it in the closing out of
business and disposal of property and any employee of the district the court
determines is necessary to closing out the business or to maintaining the
property of the district in good order until it is disposed of. Any employee
not retained by the court shall be terminated within ten working days of the
board’s dissolution and paid one month’s base salary or for one hundred
seventy-three hours, whichever is applicable, in addition to all other pay and
allowances due him. The same shall be paid to any employee retained by the
court upon his termination.
   The court shall send the director of natural resources notice of the
dissolution together with an inventory of the district’s real property, any
personal property of the district that he considers to be functionally related
to the use or management of the real property, and a full and accurate
statement of any indebtedness that is secured by the real property. The
director shall, within sixty days of receipt of such notice, notify the court
of his acceptance or rejection of any such real property and its related
personal property and indebtedness. If the director accepts, the court shall
convey the real property to the state, subject to any deed or other
restrictions placed upon use of the real property as a condition of receiving
federal or state assistance for its acquisition or development, and transfer
the related personal property to the department of natural resources. If the
director rejects, the court shall convey any real property of the district and
transfer any related personal property to any other agency of the state or any
political subdivision or instrumentality of the state located within the former
park district or within a county in which territory that was annexed to the
district is located, that is interested in acquiring the real property for
parks and recreation, conservation, or other public purposes, in that order of
priority, and that is willing to assume any related indebtedness and fulfill
any deed restrictions and any other restrictions placed upon use of the real
property as a condition of receiving federal or state assistance for its
acquisition or development.
   If no state agency, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the state
is willing to accept the real property and related personal property and
indebtedness, the court shall convey such property to the board of county
commissioners of the county in which the property is located. The board of
county commissioners may sell, lease, or transfer such property in accordance
with R.C. §§ 307.09 to 307.12. If there is any outstanding indebtedness on such
property sold or leased, the proceeds from the sale or lease shall be paid into
the fund from which payments are made to extinguish the indebtedness on such
property and the proceeds shall be used for that purpose; otherwise the
proceeds shall be paid into the general fund of the county. The budget
commission shall continue to levy and collect taxes necessary for the payment
of any outstanding indebtedness of the district for which tax revenues of the
district were pledged and that is not otherwise assumed.
   Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon dissolution of a park
district, the probate court shall order the budget commission of each county
affected to terminate the tax levies of the park district, levied under R.C. §
1545.20 or 1545.21, and the assessments levied under R.C. § 1545.18 and divide
the net indebtedness of the district among the state, political subdivisions,
and instrumentalities that acquire the district’s real property on the basis of
the market value of the real property that each acquires. Upon disposal of the
district’s real property, the court shall notify the budget commission, which
shall transfer the remaining funds of the district to the proper authorities.
§ 1545.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates R.C. § 1545.09(C) shall be punished as follows:
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred fifty dollars for a first
offense and not more than one thousand dollars for each subsequent offense.
   (B)   If the board of park commissioners that adopted the bylaw or rule that
the offender violated and that was the basis of the offender’s violation of

that section, the offender shall be penalized in accordance with the penalty so

vehicle is the subject of an immobilization waiver order issued under R.C. §
4503.235 and the other person is prohibited from operating the vehicle under
that order.
   (B)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of division (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4),
or (A)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender’s control is in a
category described in division (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4), or (A)(5) of
this section if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (A)(1), (A)(3), or (A)(5) of this section, the offender and the
operator of the motor vehicle reside in the same household and are related by
consanguinity or affinity;
      (2)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (A)(2) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle reside in the same household, and the offender knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the operator has been charged with or convicted of any
violation of law, or has committed any other act or omission, that would or
could result in the suspension or cancellation of the operator’s license,
permit, or privilege;
      (3)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (A)(4) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle occupied the motor vehicle together at the time of the offense.

motor vehicle, and shall be punished as provided in divisions (C) to (H) of
this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in division (C)(2) of this section, whoever
violates division (A)(1), (A)(2), or (A)(3) of this section is guilty of an

notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours. The

that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   (a)   If, within three years of a violation of division (A)(1), (A)
(2), or (A)(3) of this section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to

imposed under this code or R.C. Chapter 2929, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7), and, if the vehicle involved in the offense is registered in the
name of the offender, the court may order one of the following:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (C)(3)(b) or (C)(3)(c)
of this section, the court may order, for 30 days, the immobilization of the

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §
4503.233.
         (b)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4511.203, the court may order,
for 60 days, the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the
impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under R.C. § 4503.233.
         (c)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

offense. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §
4503.234.
      (4)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for

transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine imposed under this
division (C) shall be distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (D)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle, the court
shall not release the vehicle from the immobilization before the termination of
the period of immobilization ordered unless the court is presented with current
proof of financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (E)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle, upon receipt
of the order from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any
deputy registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer
of registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
order. The period of denial shall be five years after the date the order is
issued, unless, during that five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of
the offense that resulted in the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies
the Registrar of the termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and
notifies the Registrar, the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to
permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer the registration of the vehicle.

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license on
or about the person’s person shall be prima facie evidence of the person’s not
having obtained a driver’s license.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an offense. The offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;

70.99
§ 72.06  SIGNAL LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red, and yellow shall be used, except
for special pedestrian signals carrying words or symbols, and these lights
shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows.
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a U-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a U-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a U-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right- of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities may prohibit a right or a left turn against a
steady red signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs
giving notice thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Location other than an intersection. In the event an official traffic-
control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection,
the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those
provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required
shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop
shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be
made at the signal.
(R.C. § 4511.13)  Penalty, see §
70.99
§ 72.07  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   (A)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a U-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn

division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not  wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the
Rules of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available
occupant restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of
such a device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is
admissible in evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to
the extent that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of

the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor. In the case of an
attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C. Chapter 3734, other than
R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a minor
misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)  Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.03  COMPLICITY.

      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of §
130.02.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)  Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this title for which no specific penalty

   This section, formerly based on R.C. § 2907.07, was repealed because the
underlying misdemeanor offense (importuning – solicitation of a person of the
same sex to engage in sexual activity with the offender, when the offender
knows the solicitation is offensive to the other person, or is reckless in that
regard) was held unconstitutional in State v. Thompson, 767 N.E.2d 251 (Ohio
2002) (holding that the statute imposed an unconstitutional content-based
restriction on speech). For felony provisions, see R.C. § 2907.07(A), (C), (D)
