EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Struthers was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Struthers Codified Ordinances is indicated.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL,
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (a)   This City of Struthers Credit Card Policy is setting parameter, policy
and procedures for Credit card use. The City of Struthers has two types of
Credit cards that are covered under this policy.
      Type 1 Commercial Mastercard Bank Card.
      Type 2 Store Credit Card.
      (1)   General Information for a commercial Mastercard provided by the
City of Struthers banking institution. This describes the procedures for
appropriate credit card use of a general commercial credit card. This is not
intended to set parameter for store credit cards that can be removed from the
Auditor's office. This credit Card will be established through the City of
Struthers banking institution. The card will be kept in the sole possession of
the Auditors Office. No employee shall remove the card from the Auditor's
Office. The purpose of acquisition of a credit card is to acquire goods and
services that can not be easily obtained without a credit card.
      (2)   General Information for credit cards to be used at commercial store
locations. (Example: Lowes and Sam's Club)
         This describes the procedures for appropriate credit card use of
commercial store credit cards. This is not intended to set parameter for the
commercial Mastercard that can not be removed from the Auditor's Office. Store
credit cards shall be kept in the Auditor's office. Department heads and their
appointees shall remove the credit card for use by obtaining the card from the
Auditor's office. The card must be signed in and out and a log must be
completed. A log will be provided. The employee shall leave the original
receipt upon return of the card and make a copy to keep for their records. Each
employee is responsible for the security of the card and for the purchase when
made.

effect for all Credit card purchases. All requests for use of the credit card
shall be made in writing to the Auditor and preapproved by the Safety Service
Director. The city will not reimburse or pay for sales tax. Sales tax charges,
if applied, will be the responsibility of the employee. Therefore, the employee
using the card is responsible to ensure that sales tax is not applied.
         B.   Misusing the Credit Card. The credit card represents the City's
trust. Each user assumes the responsibility for the proper use of the credit
card.
   (b)   The Credit Card cannot be used for the following:
      Cash advances
      Traveler's checks
      Personal items or services
      Capital equipment

may receive such services, equipment, supplies, materials or funds on behalf of
the City, and subject to the terms of the offer and the rules and regulations,

171.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    Except as provided in Sections (d) and (e) below, each employer

of the payment of such salary, wage, commission or other compensation, the tax
of two percent (2%) of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation due by the employer to such employee and shall, on or before the
twentieth day of the month following the month of such deduction and
collection, make a return and pay to the Commissioner of Taxation the amount of
tax deducted by the day specified below.
      (1)    Monthly payments of taxes withheld are due by the twentieth day of
the month following the month of said deduction on taxes withheld when total of
the tax withheld exceeds $250.00.
      (2)    All employers not required to make monthly payments of taxes
withheld under (a)(1) of this subsection shall make quarterly returns and

quarter. For this purpose quarters refer to the period of time ending March,

hands of such employer. The officer or the employee having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the
tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a corporation does not
discharge any officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the
corporation to file returns or pay the tax due. Such employer shall be liable
for the payment of the required tax to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.

employees working in the City, shall not be required to withhold tax from
taxable income of an individual unless the total amount of tax required to be
withheld for the City on all employers exceeds $150.00 for a calendar year.
 
   (e)    Any nonresident employer who exceeds the $150.00 tax liability
requirement in any calendar year beginning with January 1, 2001, will then be
required to withhold and pay to the City; tax on all employees for work done or
services performed within the City for all ensuing years, not to exceed three
(3) consecutive years, when the tax to be withheld is less than $150.00.

171.05 shall file a declaration of the estimated tax for each taxable year
within one hundred twenty days after the beginning of each taxable year. Such
forms may simply state that the figures used in making such declaration are the
figures used in making the declaration of the estimate for the federal income
tax, provided that it is understood that such figures may be modified according

proportion of such income. In accordance with the provisions of this chapter
credit may be taken for tax to be paid to, or to be withheld and remitted to
another income taxing municipality not to exceed two percent (2%), per W-2, or
the rate of said municipality whichever is the least, not federal, state,
school district or other tax whose aim is not for local municipal purpose.
 
   (c)    Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City, may be
accompanied by a payment in full or in four equal installments due on or before
the thirtieth day of the fourth month and the fifteenth day of the sixth, ninth
and twelfth month after the beginning of the taxable year. However such
estimate may be amended at the time of making of any quarterly payment and
further provided that on or before the filing date as specified in Section
171.04 for the taxable year for which such declaration was filed a final return
shall be filed and any balance, which may be due the City, shall be paid
therewith. Should it then appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the
amount of tax to which the City would be entitled under the provisions of this
chapter a refund or credit of the amount so overpaid shall be made.

tax on such net profits, salary, wages, commissions or other compensation to
another municipality, shall be entitled to adjust the net income subject to the
tax herein imposed by deducting therefrom the net income on which he has paid
such other income tax, except that no adjustment may be made for any such
income the source of which where determined in accordance with the methods of
allocation provided herein, is within the City of Struthers. All residents of
the City of Struthers who are conducting a business or professional activity
outside of the City of Struthers, and who are not paying an income tax to any
other municipality, shall pay a tax as provided for in Section
171.03 of this chapter or any amendments on the net profits earned from such
business, profession or activity. The City of Struthers, Ohio shall have the
right to collect the full two percent (2%) from any person who resides or is
domiciled in the City of Struthers, but who receives net profits, salary,
wages, commissions or other compensation for work done, services performed or
business transacted outside of the City of Struthers who pays to such outside
municipality a lesser amount of tax than that provided in this chapter.
   
   (e)    The credit provisions of this section apply only to residents of the
City of Struthers. Nonresidents who receive net profits, salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation for work done or services performed or
rendered within the City of Struthers, and are subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter shall not be allowed a credit for any income tax paid to another
municipality, subdivision or state.

Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.

income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.

under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible

For a nonresident of the Municipality, the deduction is limited to the extent
the expenses are related to the performance of personal services by the

         (e)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
172.03(32) of this Chapter. (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A) (1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
      (2)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
      (3)    The address on the individual's driver's license;

individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

172.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
172.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following

         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B) (1)(c) of this section of
taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the
Tax Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the
end of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B) (1) (b) of this section shall be
made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than
fifteen days after the last day of each month.
      An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file a
return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
172.091 of this Chapter,
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (D)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (E)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (F)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (G)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (I)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (J)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

      (7)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section. For the purposes of this division, the location at
which an employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with
division (B) (2) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted
for "Municipal Corporation" wherever "Municipal Corporation" appears in that
division.
   
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
172.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable

      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
172.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise

compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer

the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C) (1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the

or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
172.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
172.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
172.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
172.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in

"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer"
appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty

the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
172.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
172.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
172.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
172.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
172.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact

agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
172.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B) (1) (b) or (c) of Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
172.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
172.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

(B) (3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)    (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C) (2)
(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C) (2) (a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C) (2) (a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B) (2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
172.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A) (2) of
Section

the period prescribed by division (A) (2) of Section
172.19 of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division.
If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund need be paid by
the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (C) (2) of
this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
172.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A) (4) of Section
172.10 of this Chapter.

the ordinances or rules, as adopted from time to time before January 1, 2016 of

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept
other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate, that a person

not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.

document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.13 AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

   (B)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, re determine, or correct any tax finding,

the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

172.132  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 15-061. Passed
12-23-15.)
172.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
172.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B) (1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
172.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.

   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
172.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. ((Ord. 15-061. Passed 12-23-15.)
172.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A) (4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.

taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's

determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,

Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
172.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
172.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
172.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

Employees, the estimated and proposed amount of Qualifying Investment, the
estimated and proposed amount of compensation to be paid to the New Employees,

      (2)   Recommend the continuation or non-continuation in the ITI Program;
      (3)   Adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the ITI
Program not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this chapter; and

penalty or any portion thereof, was erroneously or illegally collected, and

who shall thereupon draw his warrant for such certified amount on the Treasurer
to the person entitled to such refund, out of the Admission Tax Rotary Fund.

initiative of the Treasurer, but no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty
paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as provided for in Section

his own motion, shall have ruled that such determination was erroneous or
illegal in which event, a refund shall be made as herein provided, upon
termination of such appeal. An application for a refund made as herein provided
shall be deemed a petition for reassessment within the meaning of Section

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for

   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,

from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

pursuant to       subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the

through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the

in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.

501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

505.18 FEEDING OF WILD ANIMALS.
   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   Intentional and unintentional wildlife feeding has increased with
urban encroachment into wildlife habitat. Such feeding can lead to conflicts
between wild animals and people (including their pets and livestock) and
dangerous situations for people and/or result in the wild animal being killed.
Unless people take responsibility to remove attractants to discourage unwanted
wildlife, negative encounters will occur and wild animals will be killed.
      (2)   This section provides a tool for law enforcement personnel to warn
residents that feeding wildlife is reckless and endangers others’ safety as
well as their own. We can co-exist with native wildlife if we recognize and
appreciate the important role these animals play in maintaining a healthy
ecosystem and ensure that our activities do not adversely alter that role.
Living with the natural environment, including wildlife, greatly increases our
quality of life but also requires that we take responsibility to keep wild
animals wild by not introducing and habituating them to human sources of food.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Attractant” means any substance which could reasonably be expected
to attract a wild animal or does attract a wild animal, including but not
limited to, garbage, food products, pet food, feed, grain or salt.

organization, trade, or professional association, firm, limited liability
company, joint venture, association, trust, estate or any other legal entity,

in this state, including but not limited to, bears, coyotes, foxes, mountain
lions, deer, opossums, raccoons, skunks, seabirds and bats.
      (4)   “Waterfowl” means any bird that frequents the water, or lives about
rivers, lakes, etc., on or near the sea; an aquatic fowl, including but not
limited to, ducks, geese, swans, heron, and egrets.
   (c)   Prohibitions.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to intentionally
feed wild animals within the City so as to create a nuisance condition as
described in subsection (c)(2) hereof or in any manner that is likely to
attract rodents or other scavenger animals to the City. Feeding wild animals by
placing food directly on the ground or in a container that is not at least four
feet above the ground shall be deemed a violation of this section.
      (2)   A nuisance condition shall be deemed to exist for purposes of
subsection (c)(1) hereof when, as a natural and predictable result of the
amount and type of food given a wild animal or animals, and/or the repetitive
nature of the feedings, make the wild animal or animals do any of the following
in the City:
         A.   Creates a habitat on occupied residential property;
         B.   Causes substantial damage to tangible personal property or real
property; or
         C.   On more than one occasion, leaves feces on residential property.
   (d)   Exceptions. The prohibitions of this act shall not apply to:
      (1)   Feeding of songbirds and other backyard birds shall be permitted
outdoors at such times and in such numbers that:
         A.   Such feeding does not create an unreasonable disturbance that
affects the rights of surrounding property owners and renders other persons
insecure in the use of their property; and
         B.   Does not create an accumulation of droppings on the property and
surrounding properties; and
         C.   Does not become an attractant for rodents or other wild animals;
and
         D.   Bird feeders are placed at least five (5') feet above the ground.
   (e)   Enforcement and Penalties. Any person violating any of the
prohibitions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor for
the first offense. For the second and subsequent violations of this section,
the violator shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In
addition, the court may order, at the violator’s expense, that the wild animal
be transferred to an appropriate zoological or similar facility. If this is not
practical, as an alternative, the court may order, again at the violator’s
expense, that the wild animal be humanely destroyed by a qualified
veterinarian.

house, building, shed or any part of any of the aforesaid, or any tree, pole,
smokestack, excavation, basement, cellar, sidewalk subspace, dock, wharf or
landing dock, which in its entirety, or in any part thereof, by reason of the
condition in which the same is permitted to be or remain, shall or may endanger
the health, life, limb or property of, or cause any hurt, harm, inconvenience,
discomfort, damage or injury to, any one or more persons in the City in any one
or more of the following particulars:
   (a)    By reason of being a nuisance to the general health of the community.
   (b)    By reason of being unsafe for occupancy, or use on, in, upon, about
or around the aforesaid premises.
   (c)    By reason of being a nuisance because of long continued vacancy or
lack of reasonable or adequate maintenance of the structure and/or premises
adjacent thereto, thereby depreciating the enjoyment and use of the property in
the immediate vicinity to such an extent that it is harmful to the community in
which such structure is situated.
   (d)    By reason of being a fire hazard.
   (e)    By reason of being a nuisance caused by storing upon a vacant lot any

      (Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.02 COMPLAINT; INSPECTION; ABATEMENT NOTICE.
   Whenever a complaint is made or filed with the Mayor, Police Chief, Fire
Chief or Safety- Service Director describing or setting out the fact that a
public nuisance exists, the officer with whom such complaint has been filed
shall promptly give notice of the complaint to the Fire Chief and the Director,
who shall then make a thorough inspection of the premises on which it is
alleged that such public nuisance exists. After examination and inspection, the
Fire Chief and Director shall make a written report of the inspection and
findings with respect to the existence of such nuisance. They shall set out in
their report the findings as they are related to immediate danger to public
health, safety and welfare, which report shall be filed with the Mayor and a
copy with Council. Should the Fire Chief and the Director concur in finding
that a public nuisance exists and that the nature of such public nuisance is
such that it requires some abatement, the Fire Chief and the Director shall
determine the person, firm or corporation who, from the records in the County
Auditor's office, appears to be title owner of the property or premises on
which such alleged nuisance exists. The Fire Chief and Director shall
immediately cause a written notice to be served either through registered mail
or by a police officer on such person, firm or corporation. Notice shall be
personally served and if personal service cannot be completed then written
notice shall be left at the usual place of residence or business of the owner
or at the address of the owner as shown on the County Auditor's record, or such
notice shall be mailed to the owner, occupant or tenant, in which case the Fire
Chief and Director shall cause a copy of such notice to be left with the
person, if any, who is occupying or in joint possession of the property on
which it is alleged that the public nuisance exists. If there is no person in
possession a copy shall be posted on the premises by the Clerk of Council and
legal notice shall likewise be published in the Struthers Journal or a
newspaper of general circulation in the City, setting out the principal
elements of such alleged nuisance. The notice shall likewise state the findings
made by the Director and Fire Chief with respect to the existence of such
public nuisance and shall further state that unless the owner or occupants of
such premises cause the abatement of the public nuisance within the time set
out in such notice, namely, not less than twenty-four hours nor more than two
weeks after the service or publication of notice, the alleged nuisance will be
abated by the City at the expense of the owner or occupants. Any actual
inspection or finding required to be carried out by any public official under
the provisions of this chapter may be carried out by any subordinate officer
assigned and properly directed to perform such service by his superior.
(Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.03 PROCEDURE WHEN ABATEMENT NOT REQUIRED.
   If, after inspection and examination of the premises or real estate on which
it is reported that a public nuisance exists, the Safety-Service Director and
Fire Chief conclude or form an opinion that a public nuisance does exist but
that the nature of such nuisance does not require summary abatement, then the
Director and Chief shall take photographs and make a complete report as
provided in Section
531.02 and file it with the Mayor and Council. After the filing of such report
the Director, Chief or Clerk of Council shall cause written notice to be served
upon the person, partnership, firm or corporation who is the registered owner
of the property as registered in the County Auditor's office. Notice shall be
served by a regular member of the Police Department or by the Director or Clerk
by:
   (a)    Personally serving such owner or by leaving a copy at his usual place
of residence or business.
   (b)    By leaving a copy at the address of such owner as shown by the County
Auditor's records.
   (c)    By mailing a copy to the owner's place of residence or business by

newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for two consecutive
weeks.
   (e)    By leaving a copy of such notice with the person in possession of the
premises on which it is alleged that such public nuisance exists. If there is
no person in possession, then a copy of the notice shall be posted on the
premises.
      (Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.04 INFORMATION CONTAINED IN NOTICE.
   The notice setting out the alleged nuisance shall state, in brief, the
findings of the Safety- Service Director and the Fire Chief with respect to the
existence of a public nuisance, and shall further state that unless the owner
of such property causes the abatement of the public nuisance within thirty days
after the service of notice, the City will abate or terminate the nuisance at
the expense of the owner. The owner may at any time after receipt or service of
the notice provided in this chapter make a request in writing or in person to
the Mayor, Director or Chief that he should be furnished with a written list of
the items which are alleged to constitute the public nuisance and such other
items which are in need of repair and/or replacement and/or removal.
(Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.05 REMEDY OF OWNER.
   The owner may make an immediate application in writing to the Safety-Service
Director for a building permit to undertake the repair or replacement of the
items alleged to constitute the public nuisance. The Director, after being
furnished by the owner or owners with complete plans and specifications
covering such repairs or replacements indicating abatement of the nuisance
conditions and conformance with the City Building Code and the Ohio State
Building Code, shall issue such permit. The Director is further authorized to
grant such owner more than thirty days time in which to effect repairs,
replacements or removal if a bona fide intention to abate the nuisance is
displayed and good cause is shown that no unreasonable delay is being created
by the owner or occupants.
(Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.06 ADDITIONAL REMEDIES; HEARING AND APPEAL.
   The owner of any premises or real estate on which the alleged nuisance
exists, when notice has been served as provided hereinbefore, may within ten
days after receipt of such notice, make a demand in writing to the Safety-
Service Director for a hearing on the question as to whether or not in fact a
public nuisance exists or whether more than thirty days should be granted to
the owner to abate the nuisance. If a request for a hearing is made upon the
Director, such hearing shall be held within ten days following receipt of the
written demand and at least two days’ notice of the date of hearing shall be
given to the owner. The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Board comprised
of the Director, the Fire Chief and the Mayor and in the event any of the
aforementioned officials is unable to attend or serve on such Board, the
remaining members shall have the right to select an impartial official to serve
for the purpose of conducting this hearing. The three members of the Board must
concur that a public nuisance exists before enforcement of the abatement is
carried out. A majority of the Board may amend or modify the notice and order,
or extend the time for compliance by the owner with any parts of the abatement
order by such date as the majority of the Board may determine. A copy of the
decision and order of the Board shall be promptly served upon the owner in the
manner provided in Section
531.03. The decision of the Board and order shall be final and conclusive
unless the owner files, within ten days after the decision is rendered, an
action in or an appeal from such order with the Municipal Court of the City or
the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio. Otherwise, such order shall
become final and conclusive at the termination of such action or appeal
proceeding as determined by the Court. (Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.07 INTERPRETATION AND SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter shall not be expected to be a limitation or
restriction upon the authority of any department, division, official or
employee of the City, but shall be deemed as an enlargement of any authority
existing by virtue of the laws of the State or any other ordinance heretofore
enacted by Council.
(Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.08 COMPLIANCE WITH ORDER REQUIRED.
   No person being able to do so, shall refuse or neglect to obey a proper
order issued by the Safety-Service Director, Fire Chief or the Hearing Board.
(Ord. 6010. Passed 12-7-66.)
531.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor for each offense. Each day of noncompliance with an order after the
time specified in Sections
531.02 and
531.03 shall be deemed a separate offense.

533.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal

order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

555.07 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file with
the Fair Housing Board within 360 days of the alleged violation a complaint in
writing, sworn to or affirmed, which shall state: the name and address of the
person aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint
is filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice; a concise statement of the facts,
including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged discriminatory housing
practice; and such other information as may be required by the Board. The
complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended. The Board may also corroborate
or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or
volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the filing
of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed necessary by
the chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the secretary shall determine that
there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall
attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and
persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties
may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and
nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made public by
any member of the Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in
writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission or the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (e)    If the secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his authorized
counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to the hearing
date as he deems necessary in support of his position. The hearing shall be
open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen calendar
days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement of
charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of the
Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named
persons and production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply
with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested
parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by a duly
authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The
parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Director of
Law in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Director of Law
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the secretary determines that
the person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following
service of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify
the matter to the Director of Law for enforcement.
   The Director of Law shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action
brought in the name of the Fair Housing Board before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (h)    If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.
(Ord. 77-7003. Passed 7-14-77.)
555.08 OTHER LEGAL ACTION.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any person from exercising
any right or seeking any remedy to which he might otherwise be entitled or from
filing any complaint with any other agency or court of law or equity.
(Ord. 77-7003. Passed 7-14-77.)
555.99 PENALTY.

violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and,
where appropriate, punitive damages of not more than one thousand dollars

909.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Street openings, sidewalk openings and other openings in public areas shall
be governed and regulated in accordance with this Part Nine - Streets,
Utilities and Public Services Code. (Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.02 APPLICATIONS FOR PERMITS; FEE.
   (a)    Applications. Permits for making openings in City streets shall be
issued only by the Director of Public Safety and only for some duly authorized
purpose. Applications for street opening permits shall be made on forms
provided by the Department of Safety-Service. The application shall give the
size and location of the proposed opening and shall state the kind of paving
where the cut is to be made. The permit shall be issued only after ample
security has been given the City to insure the proper restoration and
subsequent maintenance of the street pavement disturbed. Such security shall be
furnished in either of two ways as follows:
      (1)   A cash deposit may be made with each application sufficient to
cover the cost of restoration; or
      (2)    A surety bond may be filed with each application to cover the cost
of restoration. Such bond shall remain in effect for a one-year period; and
      (3)    A general deposit may be made, to be replenished from time to time
and to constitute a running account against which permits may be issued
provided that no permit shall be issued when the net unencumbered balance in
the account becomes less than the estimated cost of the requisite restoration.
   In the case of City contracts involving the cutting of street pavements,
permits may be issued without cash deposit, but in such cases sufficient money
to pay for the necessary street restoration shall be withheld from the contract
moneys owing to the contractor until such street restoration is completed by
the contractor to the satisfaction of the Safety-Service Director, or until
such contractor shall have paid to the City the requisite amount for the street
restoration.
   (b)    Fee. A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be paid for the
issuing of such permit. (Ord. 94-9273. Passed 2-15-94.)
909.03 OPENINGS BY CITY, COUNTY OR STATE.
   When any City department or division requires the installation of
underground conduits or structures, it may obtain the necessary street opening
permits without making any cash deposit. The department or division shall be
charged, however, for the necessary street restoration work, and the amount of
the charge shall be paid out of the appropriations for the respective
department or division. In special cases, the Safety-Service Director may, in
his discretion, direct the performance of the street restoration work to be
done by the Department of Public Safety and Service without charging the
department or division for whose purposes the work is done. No cash deposit
shall be required from the County or the State for street opening permits.
Where, in any such case, the work done inures greatly to the benefit of the
City, the street restoration may, with the approval of the Safety-Service
Director, be made at the cost of the City.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.04 OPENINGS BY PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS.
   Where a public utility corporation is authorized by a special agreement with
the City to do its own restoration work in connection with the opening of
streets for maintenance and construction work, the required deposit shall be
sufficient to cover inspection costs. If, however, in any case the restoration
is to be made by the City, the deposit shall be increased accordingly. Any such
public utility corporation shall be permitted to maintain with the City
Treasurer a general deposit account to be replenished from time to time,
against which permits may be issued. No permit shall be issued when the net
unencumbered balance is less than the amount necessary to cover the estimated
City costs for inspection and restoration.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.05 RESTORATION OF PAVEMENT.
   Where openings have been or are to be made in a street, the Safety-Service
Director shall provide for the restoration of the street pavement in one of the
following ways:
   (a)    The entire work of restoration, including both paving surface and
paving base, may be performed directly by the Department of Public Safety and
Service after the permittee has completed the back fill.
   (b)    The paving surface may be installed by the Department after the
permittee has made the back fill and installed the pavement base.
   (c)    The work may be done either completely as in (a) or as to paving
surface only, as in (b), by a City contractor thereunto duly authorized by a
contract with the City.
   (d)    The entire work of restoration may be done by the permittee.
      (Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.06 LIMITATIONS ON OPENINGS.
   No person, firm or corporation shall make any opening in, break, tear up,
excavate or remove the surface of any street, avenue, alley or other public
way, or any portion thereof, in the City, in, or upon any street, avenue, alley
or other public way, which shall be built, paved, resurfaced or repaved at any
time within a period of five years after the building, paving, resurfacing or
repaving of the street or alley; and the Director of Public Safety and Service
or Street Superintendent and all other officers and departments of the City are
hereby prohibited from granting any permits for any such openings, breaks,
tearing up, excavation or removal within this period; provided that the
Director of Safety and Service may, on account of any emergency affecting
public health or public welfare, and which could not have been foreseen,
suspend the operation of this five-year rule as to any application for a
permit, and in such cases, upon granting of the application, the work may be
performed within the five-year period but the mere failure or neglect of the
applicant, or other person, firm or corporation to lay or have laid, mains,
pipes, wires or connections or other means of transportation of utilities
before the five-year period, or the inconvenience, by reason of the failure or
neglect, to property along the particular street or way described in the
application shall not be considered to be an emergency; provided further, that
where water mains or water pipes were laid along or to any lot or piece of
property previous to the beginning of the five-year period, and, by reason of
unforseen development, the water mains or service pipes have become, in the
opinion of the Director of Public Safety and Service, of inadequate size, then
the Director of Public Safety and Service may suspend the five-year rule for
the purpose of and to the extent necessary for the laying of larger water mains
or larger service pipes in any street or other public way. The five-year period
shall be deemed to begin at the time of the completion and final acceptance by
the City of any construction, paving, resurfacing or repaving.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.07 EMERGENCY OPENING; ADDITIONAL DEPOSIT.
   Whenever an application is made within the five-year period by any person,
firm or corporation and the application may be granted by reason of any
emergency as defined in Section
909.06, then such permit shall not be granted unless and until the applicant
deposits with the City Treasurer, in addition to the sum or sums provided for
in Section
909.02, a sum equal to fifteen percent of the amount required to be deposited
by virtue of the provisions of Section
909.02, the additional deposit being designed to compensate the City for the
depreciation or additional maintenance cost due to the openings in such newly
paved streets or ways; the additional deposits to be also credited to the
Street Restoration Fund, and not, under any circumstances, subject to being
refunded.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.08 NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNERS.
   Each notice now required by the statutes of Ohio to be given to the owner of
each piece of property to be assessed, of the passage of the resolution by
Council, declaring the necessity for construction, paving or resurfacing any
street or alley, or other public way, shall contain, in addition to the other
requirements of the law, a notice to the property owner that any excavation or
opening within the limits of the street, public way or alley, for the purpose
of laying gas or water mains or of making water, gas, or sewer connections, or
for any other purpose whatsoever, must be made before the beginning of such
work of construction, paving or resurfacing.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.09 NOTICE TO DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICE.
   At or about the same time as the giving of the notices provided in Section
909.08, the Clerk of Council shall send to the Director of Public Safety and
Service a copy of the resolution of necessity, including a copy of the notice
sent to the property owners, to enable the Director to compel the making of
sewer and water connections as provided in Ohio R.C. 729.06.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.10 NOTICE TO PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANIES.
   At the time the notice is sent to or served upon the abutting property
holders, it shall also be the duty of the Clerk of Council to send, by mail, a
copy of the notice to each person, firm or corporation that at that time is
engaged in the business of operating a street railway or furnishing light,
heat, gas, electricity, power, telephone or telegraph service or other public
utilities requiring the occupancy of any part of the streets, public ways or
alleys of the City; but the failure of the Clerk to send, or of such property
owners or corporations or officers to receive such notices or the failure of
the Director of Public Safety and Service to take steps to compel water and
sewer connections shall not in any way affect the other regulations of this
chapter, or the penalties, to create an emergency within the meaning of
Sections
909.06 and
909.07.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.11 RULES AND SCHEDULES.
   A complete set of rules and regulations shall be prepared by the Safety-
Service Director and approved by Council, describing in detail the procedure to
be observed in obtaining permits, and precautions to be taken in acting under
the permits when issued. Specifications shall also be similarly prepared
describing the manner in which restoration work shall be done. The rules and
regulations shall contain a schedule of prices to be charged for various size
openings in various kinds of paving, due regard being given to the kind of
service to be rendered by the Department of Public Safety and Service in
connection with the restoration work. Council has the right to change the
rules, regulations and specifications and to revise the schedule of prices
whenever in its judgment the interest of the City requires such change or
revision.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.12 DUTIES OF DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICE.

made and permits to be granted under the provisions of this chapter;
   (b)    To adopt and enforce suitable rules and regulations for determining
the estimated cost of the restoration of any openings in any street, alley,
sidewalk or public way, and for the restoration by the Street Department of the
openings;
   (c)    To employ any clerks, inspectors and other employees as may be deemed
necessary by the Director to carry into effect the provisions of this chapter.
The salaries of the clerks, inspectors and other employees shall be paid by the
City Treasurer out of the Street Restoration Fund on presentation of the proper
voucher or payroll, signed according to law.
      (Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)

   In all cases in which the construction, repair or alteration of any building
or other structure will require an excavation within three feet of the curb
line of any street, permits must be obtained from the Department of Public
Safety and Service before the excavating is commenced. Such permits shall be
similar to those issued for street openings, and applications therefore must be
accompanied by deposits based on the estimated cost of restoring the street in
case of settlement, using the schedule of prices fixed for street openings. In
cases where the edge of the excavation is more than three feet from the curb
line, the Safety-Service Director shall, at the first indication of any
settlement in the street surface or curbing, require the builder to obtain a
street opening permit from the Department of Public Safety and Service and
shall have the right to suspend or cancel the building permit until the street
opening permit has been issued.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.15 SETTLING OF STREETS DUE TO BUILDING OPERATIONS.
   Whenever it appears that a settlement has taken place in the paving of any
street because of building operations, and that no permit deposit or other
provision has been made for the street restoration, the expense of the
necessary restoration shall be charged to the property owner as though a permit
had been issued, and where necessary, suit shall be brought by the Law Director
to collect the amount of the same, if not paid.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)
909.16 UNDEDICATED STREETS, CONSTRUCTION UNDER PUBLIC SUPERVISION.
   Whenever the owner of any undedicated street, which has been tentatively
approved by the Planning Commission for acceptance by the City, desires to
improve the same, at his own expense, under public inspection and supervision,
by paving, setting curbs and gutters, laying sidewalks, sewering or otherwise
improving the same, or desires to construct a sewer through private property to
connect with a public sewer, he shall deposit the estimated cost of inspection
and supervision and submit the plans and specifications under which the work is
to be executed, and shall secure from the Safety-Service Director a permit,
which shall set forth the conditions and modifications of such plans and
specifications under which such inspection and supervision will be given.

services have been paid.
(Ord. 4402. Passed 6-15-60.)

necessary, in order to avoid unduly penalizing any user who may be a victim of
circumstances under which he had no control. In the event it can be shown to
the satisfaction of the Safety-Service Director, or his designee, with respect
to any lots, parcels or premises containing a swimming pool, that the water
consumed for filling, or partially filling such swimming pool, is provided by a
source upon which the sewer charge is determined and is not connected to nor
enters into the sanitary sewer system when discharged, such user can make
application for a sewer charge adjustment, prior to filling, or partially
filling such pool, at the Office of the Safety-Service Director.
   The Safety-Service Director, or his designee, shall investigate and
determine, by appropriate mathematical means, the volume of water allowable and
necessary to fill such pool to its appropriate level.
   The Safety-Service Director, or his designee, shall certify the volume of
water to be allowed for reimbursement to the Auditor. The Auditor shall
reimburse the user based on the applicable user rate and the volume of water
certified as allowed for reimbursement by the Safety- Service Director, or his
designee, upon presentation by the user of a paid-in-full sewer user charge
receipt that reflects the volume of water used for pool consumption.
   Reimbursement shall be limited to once in any calendar year and in no case
shall be made where the user's application for reimbursement was not, or could
not be certified by the Safety- Service Director or his designee.
   Such rules and regulations shall be approved by Council. The Safety-Service
Director is further authorized to enter into a contract with the Ohio Water
Service Company to make collections of such sewer rental charges, which
contract shall set out necessary details to make collections of such charges
proper and efficient.

933.05 FEDERAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)    Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment
Standard for control of toxic pollutants as designated in Section 307(a) of the
Federal Act for a particular industrial subcategory, the Federal standard, if
more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that
subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this
chapter. The Director shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12.
   (b)    Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the
City's wastewater treatment works achieves consistent removal of pollutants
limited by Federal pretreatment standards, the City may apply to the State
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the Federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" means reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment works to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in ninety-five percent (95%) of the samples taken when
measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) and
amendments thereto of (Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403)
"General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution"
promulgated pursuant to the Act. The City may modify pollutant discharge limits
in the Federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR,
Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval
authority is obtained.
   (c)    State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharge
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal requirements
and limitations or those in this chapter.

      (3)    Pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Act, user charges
shall be computed only in accordance with the model below:
 
         Cu = Ct Vu
          Vt
where
Cu = a user's sewer charge per unit of time
Ct = total system operating costs per unit of time
Vt = total volume contribution per unit of time
Vu = a user's total water usage or wastewater discharge in 100 cubic
feet (cf) per unit of time
Ct/Vt = unit cost of sewer service in $/100 c.f.
   (b)    Metering and Billing Procedures.
      (1)    For lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises using water
exclusively supplied by the waterworks serving the City, such sewage service
charge or rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or
therein as measured by the waterworks water meters and shall be at the rate
established in Section
933.28 for each 100 cubic feet of water consumed/month.
      (2)    For lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises using water
supplied either in whole or in part from sources other than the waterworks
system serving the City, the Director may require the owner or other interested
party to install water meters or other meters satisfactory to the Director to
the extent necessary to measure all such supplies of water, and the quantity of
water consumed on such lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises shall be
deemed to be the aggregate amount disclosed by such meters; provided that, if
the Director finds it is not practical to measure by meter any water supplied
from sources other than the waterworks system of the City, he shall measure the
same in such manner and by such method as he may find practicable in the light
of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case; provided further,
that such methods are in accordance with accepted engineering practices. The
amount which would be payable at current City water rates, for the aggregate
amount of water consumed and measured as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof,
shall then constitute the base for application of the sewerage service charge
or rental provided in subsection (b)(1) hereof.
      (3)    In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Director
with respect to any lots, parcels of land, building or premises, that a portion
of the water, from any source, consumed on the premises does not and cannot
enter the system, then in each such case, the owner or other interested party
may, at his expense, install and maintain separate metering devices which shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that portion of the water so
consumed on the lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises which is
discharged into the system, and such portion shall then constitute the base for
application of the sewerage service charge or rental provided in subsection (b)
(1) hereof for these lots, parcels of land, buildings or premises.
      (4)    The sewerage service charge or rental established herein shall be
payable at the office of an authorized collecting agent of the City and shall
be billed at the same time, either quarterly or monthly, as may be applicable,
and for the same period as water charges are billed. The rate or charge for
such sewerage service shall be rendered with and placed upon the bill or
statement submitted for the use of the water service of the City, or at the
same time that water bills are rendered, in the event that subsection (b)(2)
hereof applies. Debt service charges shall be levied equally upon all users in
accordance with the rate established in Section
933.28 .
      (5)    No free service or discounts of any kind shall be rendered by the
system to the City or any department thereof, to any corporation, public or
private, to any school, public or private, to any institutions, charitable or
otherwise or to any other users. If any of the persons in this subsection (b)
(5) hereof so enumerated avail themselves of the service of the system for
general purposes or for any other purpose, the rates herein established, which
are declared to be as to such person, reasonable rates, shall be charged
against such person and shall be paid at the time and in the manner herein
otherwise provided for the payment of such rates.
       (6)    Sewerage service charges levied at the rates established shall
thereafter be billed in accordance with procedures established by the City
Auditor.
   (c)    Revisions and Rate Increases. The Director, with the assistance of
the Mayor, WWIP Manager, Auditor and Chairman of the Finance and Legislation
Committee of Council, shall annually review total system operating costs and
user charge rates and shall periodically recommend any necessary revisions in
user charges to the legislative authority of the City for approval to ensure
that sufficient revenue shall be available to defray total wastewater system
operating costs.

933.15 SEWER USE SURCHARGES.
   (a)    As provided in Section
933.14(a) surcharges shall be assessed for extra-strength wastewater for which
the concentration of BOD, suspended solids or other pollutants exceeds the
concentration of these pollutants in normal strength wastewater.
   Surcharges shall also be assessed for the City's cost of consistently
removing at the City's wastewater treatment facilities toxic pollutants as
defined in the categorical standards and amendments thereto.
   (b)    Wastewater pollutant concentrations shall be determined from the
City's pretreatment compliance monitoring program and any necessary special
surveillance, user's self- monitoring data and/or EPA compliance monitoring
data.
   (c)    As required by Federal law, surcharges shall be added to a user's
sewer use charges and shall remain in effect as long as normal strength
wastewater values are exceeded.
   (d)    Consistent with the Act, surcharges shall be computed in accordance
with the model below:
   
      Cs =    K(BcB+ ScS + PcP) Vu
      where
      Cs =    Surcharge for extra-strength waste
      K =    concentration to mass loading conversion factor equal to .0626
      Bc =    unit operating cost for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in $/lb.
      B =    concentration (mg/l) of BOD from a user above 250 mg/l (normal
strength wastewater)
      Sc =    unit operating cost for suspended solids (nonfilterable residue)
in $/lb.
      S =    concentration (mg/l) of suspended solids from a user above 300 mg/
l (normal strength wastewater)
      Pc =    unit operating cost of any pollutant in $/lb.
      P =    concentration (mg/l) of any pollutant from a user above normal
strength wastewater concentration.
      Vu =    a user's total water usage or wastewater discharge in 100 cubic
feet per unit of time.

933.30 GREASE TRAPS.
   Struthers City Council hereby establishes rules for grease traps in the
Struthers Waste Water/Mahoning County Service Area. They are as follows:
   (a)   Scope and Purpose. To aid in the prevention of sanitary sewer
blockages and obstructions from contributions and accumulation of fats, oils
and grease into the sanitary sewer system from industrial and commercial
establishments, particularly food preparation and serving facilities.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Fats, oils and greases: Organic polar compounds derived from animal
and/or plant sources that contain multiple carbon chain triglyceride molecules.
These substances are detectable and measurable using analytical test procedures
established in the United States Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 136, as may
be amended from time to time. All are sometimes referred to herein as “grease”
or “greases”.
      (2)   Grease traps: A device for separating and retaining waterborne
greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater exiting the trap and
entering the sanitary sewer collection and treatment system. Such traps are
typically compact under-the-sink units that are near food preparation areas.
      (3)   Grease interceptor: A structure or device designed for the purpose
of removing and preventing fats, oils, grease from the sanitary sewer
collection system. These devices are often below-ground units in outside areas
and are built as two or three chamber baffled tanks.
      (4)   Food service establishments: Those establishments primarily engaged
in activities of preparing, serving or otherwise making available for
consumption by the public such as restaurant, commercial kitchen, caterer,
hotel, school, hospital, prison, correctional facility, and care institution.
These establishments use one or more of the following preparation activities:
Cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all methods), grilling, sauteing,
rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods), boiling, blanching, roasting,
toasting or poaching. Also included are infrared heating, searing, barbecuing
and any other food preparation activity that produces a hot, non- drinkable
food product in or on a receptacle that requires washing.
      (5)   User: Any person, including those located outside the
jurisdictional limits of the City of Struthers who contributes to, causes or
permits the contribution or discharge of wastewater into the sewers within the
City’s service area, including persons who contribute such wastewater from
mobile sources, such as those who discharge hauled wastewater.

service establishments discharging wastewater to the City of Struthers
Wastewater Treatment Plant are subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Grease interceptor requirements: All permitted food service
establishments are required to install, operate and maintain an approved type
and adequately sized grease interceptor necessary to maintain compliance with
the objectives of this section. All grease interceptors must meet the
requirements of the City of Struthers and Mahoning County Plumbing Codes.
      (2)   All existing food establishments, determined by the Safety Service
Director/Wastewater Plant Manager, to have a reasonable potential to adversely
impact the City’s sewer system will be notified of their obligation to install
a grease interceptor within the specified period set forth in the notification
letter.
      (3)   Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements: Grease interceptors
required under this section shall be installed unless the Mahoning County Board
of Health and/or the Struthers Health Department determines the installation of
a grease interceptor would not be feasible. The food establishment bears the
burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not
feasible. The Mahoning County Board of Health may authorize the installation of
an indoor grease trap where the installation of a grease interceptor is not
feasible due to space constraints or other considerations.
      (4)   Interceptors shall be provided, operated and maintained whenever
liquid or wastes are received by the plumbing system, which may contain
flammable, explosive, noxious, toxic, gaseous or other materials that may be
hazardous to the building drainage system, the wastewater system, sewage
treatment plant processes and personnel.
      (5)   All interceptors shall be of such capacity and volume as to retain
the liquid for a sufficient length of time to permit the deleterious and
detrimental materials to separate from the other wastes before they are
discharged into the building drain or sewer. (If necessary, strainers shall be
installed to retain and collect solid materials one half inch or larger in any
dimension.)
      (6)   Interceptors shall be located so as to be readily accessible at all
times, with sufficient head room and clear area around them to permit easy
inspection and the removal of the accumulated materials from within the
interceptor at such intervals and at such times as may be necessary to assure
the continued efficient operation of the interceptor and as necessary to
prevent the entrance of the deleterious and detrimental materials into the
sewerage system. All materials removed shall be disposed of in a manner that
will not permit them to enter the sewerage system or wastewater treatment
plant.
      (7)   Grease interceptors for kitchen wastes shall be installed so that
they will receive all kitchen wastes except those from food waste grinders.
Grease interceptors shall be installed immediately outside the building where
there is easy access for cleaning, unless it is impractical, in which case they
may be installed adjacent to or outside the food preparation area.
      (8)   The grease interceptor shall be inspected every thirty (30) days
and cleaned to remove the grease wastes. The materials removed in cleaning
shall be removed from the premises for disposal and not deposited in the
plumbing or sewerage systems.
      (9)   All grease interceptors/traps for sewers/discharging to the
Struthers Sewer System must be registered and permitted by the Department of
Wastewater, using a permit and registration application available from the
Struthers Department of Wastewater.
   (d)   Wastewater Discharge Limitations.
      (1)   No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from subject
grease interceptor, grease trap or alternative pretreatment technology to
exceed 100 milligrams per liter as defined by EPA test method 1664 or

it agrees to pay for services consumed at the property.
   (c)   Definition of Billing Address. The “Billing Address” is the address at
which the customer who is liable for service furnished to a service address
receives billings from the City of Struthers. Billing addresses may, but need
not be, the address at which service is delivered.
   (d)   Definition of Service Address. The “Service Address” is any property
at which services are furnished to a Consumer or Customer.
   (e)   Liability for Charges for Services Collection of Delinquent Charges.
      (1)   Customer and Consumer are subject to all laws of the State of Ohio
and Codified Ordinances of the City now in effect or hereinafter enacted as
applied to the City. The City may utilize all statutory procedures and remedies
to collect delinquent services, charges and fees. It shall be the duty of
persons purchasing property to ascertain if there are any unpaid bills for
service to the property prior to application for service and to make such that
provision is made for payment of outstanding sewer service bills.
      (2)   Any person who purchases property assumes the liability for payment
of outstanding charges for services to the property.
   (f)   Customer May Have Consumer Pay for Sewer Services. In all accounts,
the owner of the property, as customer, shall be primarily liable for all
charges for services provided to the property. If any Customer elects to have
the Consumer pay the charges for services as they accrue, the Customer shall
not thereby be relieved from payment of any delinquencies that might occur.
Discharge of a Consumer’s obligation to pay charges for service in any
bankruptcy proceeding shall not extinguish the obligation of the Customer to
pay for charges for services to the property.
   (g)   Bills to be Delivered to Customers or Consumers. Failure to receive
bills for service shall not relieve any person or entity responsible for
payment from their obligation to pay such bills. Upon application, the Customer
shall advise the City whether to mail bills to Customer or Consumer. Property
owners may make a public records request by mail or telephone of the payments
and billing on any property, subject to City charges for public records
requests. To the extent possible, the City shall make arrangements to provide
duplicates of bills or summaries of billings for multiple properties to
customers who do not occupy particular service addresses. The person requesting
such bills shall reimburse the actual cost to the City of providing such
additional reports to the extent provided by the public records policy of the
City of Struthers and the Ohio Revised Code.
   (h)   Metered Bills Become Delinquent. Bills become delinquent when not paid
by the date indicated on the bill.
   (i)   Partial Payments. Partial payments may be accepted upon approval of
the Auditor of the City or her designee.
   (j)   Landlord May Not Request Tenant’s Sewer to be Discontinued. When
services have been established by a tenant, a Landlord may not request that
sewer service be discontinued. Ohio R.C. 5321.04(A)(6) titled “Obligations of
Landlord” states that a landlord who is a party to a rental agreement shall
“Supply running water, reasonable amounts of hot water, and reasonable heat at
all times”. This statute prevents a Landlord from discontinuing service for
such purposes as eviction, enforcing collection of rents, or as a result of
differences between Landlord and Tenant. The City will not be liable for
damages as a result of the enforcement of this regulation in any case. Any
decision to discontinue sewer service will be made solely by the City.
   (k)   Owner’s (Customer’s) Liability for Sewer Service Bills Not Paid By
Consumer. The City will make every possible effort to collect sewer service
bills and assessments as promptly as the nature and volume of its business
permits, but no Customer or Consumer shall be relieved from an obligation for
assessments that may be unpaid through failure of the City to make collections
as provided by its Rules.
   (l)   Civil Penalty for Tampering With Equipment. A civil penalty of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be assessed against any person or entity who
modifies, reconfigures, circumvents or otherwise tampers with any equipment of
the City or other public utilities of the City plus all costs of repairs of the
damaged equipment as well as the existing rates for consumed services.

   If Aqua Ohio, Inc. waives fees and charges for water usage, any sewage
system fees and charges attributable to the fees and charges for water usage
waived by Aqua Ohio, Inc. shall also be waived. (Ord. 18-053. Passed 9-12-18.)

   A monthly service fee shall be imposed upon all real developed property in
the City to fund the Storm Water Management Program. This service fee shall be
known as the Storm Water Management Fee (“Fee”). The City Council acting as the

Management Fee. The monthly rate shall be calculated to insure adequate
revenues to fund the costs of the Storm Water Management Program, including
operation, maintenance, and capital improvements and debt service.
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
935.07 CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINATION OF THE
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (a)   For purposes of assessing the Storm Water Management Fee, all
properties in the City are classified into one of the following use classes:
            Use Class
      (1)   Single family dwelling properties
      (2)   Multi-family dwelling properties
      (3)   Single unit commercial properties
      (4)   Multi-unit commercial properties
      (5)   Institutional properties
      (6)   Industrial properties (Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
   (b)   Single Family Residential Fee. The Council finds that the intensity of
development for most parcels of real property in the City classified as single
family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and
unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the
improvements (such as building, structure, and other impervious area) on each
such parcel. Therefore, all single family residential properties in the City
shall be charged a flat Storm Water Management Fee, equal to the base rate,
regardless of the size of the parcel or the improvements. Said flat base rate
shall be four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per month.
(Ord. 20-024. Passed 7-27-20.)
   (c)   Other developed property within the range of impervious area and
impervious surface area, for the same reasons stated in article (b), shall be
charged a flat fee as follows:
            
 
        Base Impervious Surface/Area
Multi-unit residential      3,500 sq. ft. to 7,000 sq. ft. = 2x the base rate per
month
Single-unit commercial   7,001 sq. ft. to 10,500 sq. ft.= 3x the base rate per
month.
Multi-unit commercial    10,501 sq. ft. to 14,000 sq. ft.= 4x the base rate per
month.
Institutional    14,001 sq. ft. to 17,500 sq. ft.= 5x the base rate per month.
Industrial    17,501 sq. ft. to 21,000 sq. ft.= 6x the base rate per month.
   Except for single family residential properties as provided in subsection
(d) hereof, where the amount of impervious surface/area for any use
classification of developed property shall differ from the base amount of
impervious surface/area above the Fee shall be calculated as follows:
   Number of Base Units, or parts thereof, multiplied by the Base Rate not to
exceed 25 times the base rate.
   Illustration: A developed property of 41,000 sq. ft. of impervious surface/
area.
   41,000 sq. ft. divided by 3500 (Base Unit) = 11.7 Base Units
   12 Base Units X $3.50 = $42.00/ month
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
935.08 ESTABLISHING THE BASE RATE.
   The Council acting as the Board shall, by Ordinance, establish the monthly
rate for the Storm Water Management Fee. The monthly rate shall be calculated
to insure adequate revenues to fund the costs of storm water management and to
provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements and debt
service for the storm water system in the City.
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
935.09 CHARGES FOR TAX-EXEMPT PROPERTIES; EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   City of Struthers Council finds that all real property in the City
contributes to runoff and either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the
storm water system. Therefore, except as otherwise provided in this Section,
all real property in the City, including property that is tax exempt from
property tax by the State of Ohio Department of Assessments and Taxation, shall
be subject to said Storm Water Management Fee.
   (b)   Property which is owned by the City shall be exempt from the Fee.
   (c)   Undeveloped Property shall be exempt from the Fee.
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
935.10 WHEN STORMWATER FEE PAYABLE; INTEREST AND PENALTIES; LIEN ON REAL
PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Fee is due upon thirty days of receipt.
   (b)   The Fee, including interest and penalties the same as those that apply
to delinquent city income taxes, when overdue is a lien on real property and
may be collected in the same manner as delinquent real property taxes, turned
over to a collection agency, or by a suit against the property owner.
   (c)   When the Fee is past due, the City Auditor shall notify the
responsible party by mail of the actions that will be taken pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Whenever payment of the Fee becomes 60 days in arrears the City
Auditor shall take the appropriate action as per subsection (b) hereof.
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
935.11 REQUESTS FOR CORRECTION OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE.
   (a)    A responsible party may petition a correction of the Fee by
submitting the request in writing to the Safety Service Director within thirty
days after the date the notice or the bill is mailed or issued to the
responsible party. Grounds for correction of the Fee include:
      (1)    Incorrect classification of the property for purposes of
determining the Fee.
      (2)    Errors in the identification of the responsible party of a
property subject to the Fee.
   (b)    The Safety Service Director shall make a determination within thirty
days after receipt of the responsible party’s completed written petition for
correction of the Fee. The Safety Service Director’s decision on a request for
correction of the Fee shall be final.
   (c)   The petitioner must comply with all rules and procedures adopted by
the City when submitting a request for correction of the Fee and must provide
all information necessary for the Safety Service Director to make a
determination on a request for correction of the Fee. If a property owner
alleges an error under Section
935.07 , the request for correction must include a certification by a
registered engineer or professional land surveyor of the impervious surface
area of the property. Failure to comply with the provisions of this subsection
shall be grounds for denial of the request.
(Ord. 07-050. Passed 6-13-07.)
CHAPTER 937
Erosion and Sediment Control
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 08-046, passed May 14, 2008, Council
has adopted the City of Struthers Erosion and Sediment Control Rules as part of
the implementation of the Storm Water Program. Said rules are marked Exhibit
“A” attached to Ordinance 08-046, and made a part thereof. Copies are on file
at City Hall.
CHAPTER 939
Storm Water Discharges Associated
with Construction Activity
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 08-047, passed May 14, 2008, Council
authorized for Storm Water discharges associated with construction activity
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System in accordance with
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   In compliance with the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. Section 1251) and the Ohio Water Pollution Control
Act (ORC 6111), discharges of Storm Water from sites where construction
activity is being conducted, as defined in Part 1.B of this Permit (Exhibit A)
are authorized by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to discharge from
the outfalls at the sites and to the receiving surface waters for the State
identified in their notice of intent application form on file with the Ohio EPA
in accordance with the conditions specified in Part I through Part VII of this
permit.
   It has been determined that a lowering of water quality of various waters of
the State associated with granting coverage under this permit is necessary to
accommodate important social and economic development in the State of Ohio. In
accordance with OAC 3745-1-05, this decision was reached only after examining a
series of technical alternatives, reviewing social and economic issues related
to the degradation, and considering all public and intergovernmental comments
received concerning the proposal.
   Said permit is marked Exhibit “A” attached to Ordinance 08- 47 and made a
part thereof. Copies are on file at City Hall.

not thereafter be reestablished and the future use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.

1303.01 FIRE DAMAGED STRUCTURES REMOVAL, REPAIR SECURING FUND.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86 (C) and (D), whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief in the aggregate two
thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and each
fraction of that amount of a claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or
companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate.
      Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the
costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after
the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in
excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the City
has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (b)    Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by
the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261. When transferring the funds as required
in subsection (a) hereof an insurance company shall provide the City with the
name and address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall
contact the insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received
by the City and notify them that the following procedures will be followed: The
fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when repairs, removal
or securing of the building or other structure have been completed and the
required proof has been received by the designated officer, if the City has not
incurred any costs for the repairs, removal or securing. However, the fund
shall be returned to the named insured or insureds no later than sixty days
after the designated officer receives the required proof. If the City has
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund, and if excess funds remain,
the City shall transfer, no later than sixty days after all such costs have
been paid the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to limit the ability of the City to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the City and the named insured or insureds from entering
into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or
insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
   (c)    The Fire Chief of the City is hereby designated as the Officer
authorized to carry out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a
certified copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the
State.
   (d)    There is hereby created a special fund for the purpose of the
following: to allow for separate accounting of all moneys received from
insurance companies in relation to demolishing or securing fire damaged
buildings in the City. The fund shall be known as the Fire Insurance Recovery
Fund. The Auditor is hereby authorized to spend any moneys associated with the
demolishing or securing of fire-damaged buildings from the fund.
1303.02 STRUCTURE REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY PERMIT.
   Council hereby prohibits the Safety-Service Director or any agent authorized
to issue a building permit from issuing a building permit for any structure
that requires a permit from either the Federal or State Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) until such permit has been obtained from the Federal or
State EPA.

   (a)   General. As used in this Code, "Total Cost" means any cost incurred by

structure that is insecure, unsafe, structurally defective, and/or unfit for
human occupancy. The Total Cost shall be paid by the City. When the City incurs

the property owner at his or her last known tax billing address according to
the tax records of Mahoning County. If the property owner fails to pay the
invoice within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, the City may
collect the Total Cost by any of the following methods:
      (1)   The Clerk of Council may certify the Total Cost, together with the
parcel number or another proper description of the land on which the building
or other structure was located, the date the costs were incurred, and the name
of the owner of record at the time the costs were incurred, to the Mahoning
County Auditor, who shall then place the costs as a charge upon the tax and
duplicate, at which time the Total Cost are a lien upon such lands from and
after the date the costs were incurred. The Total Cost shall be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City. The placement of the Total Cost on the
tax list and duplicate shall relate back to, and is effective in priority, as
of the date the costs were incurred, provided that the City certifies the Total
Cost within one year from the date the costs were incurred.
       (2)   The City may commence a civil action to recover the Total Cost
from the person who held title to the parcel at the time the costs were
incurred.
      (3)   The City may file a lien on the parcel of land upon which the
building or other structure was located for the Total Cost by filing a written
affidavit with the Mahoning County Recorder that states the parcel number, the
Total Cost, and the date on which the costs were incurred. The City may then
pursue a foreclosure action to enforce the lien a court of competent
jurisdiction or, pursuant to §§ 323.65 to 323.79 of the Ohio Revised Code, as
hereinafter amended, with the board of revision. The City may elect to acquire
the parcel by indicating such an election in the complaint for foreclosure or
in an amended complaint. Upon the entry of a decree of foreclosure, the
Mahoning County Sheriff shall advertise and offer the property for sale on at
least one occasion. The minimum bid with regard to the sale of the foreclosed
property shall equal the sum of the taxes,
penalties, interest, costs, and assessments due and payable on the property,
the Total Cost, and any associated court costs and interest as authorized by
law. An owner of the property may redeem the property by paying the minimum bid
within ten (10) days after the entry of the decree of foreclosure. If an owner
fails to so redeem the property, and if the parcel is not sold for want of a
minimum bid, the property shall be disposed of as follows:
         A.   If the City elects to acquire the property, the parcel shall be
transferred to the City as if the property were transferred by all owners in
title to the City in lieu of foreclosure as provided in Section 5722.10 of the
Ohio Revised Code, as hereinafter amended, in which case the property shall not
be subject to foreclosure or forfeiture under Section 323.25 or Chapter 5721.
or 5723. of the Ohio Revised Code and any lien on the property for costs
incurred for any unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, charges, or assessments
shall be extinguished; or
         B.   If the City does not elect to acquire the property, the parcel
shall be forfeited to the state or to a political subdivision or school
district as provided in Chapter 5723. of the Ohio Revised Code, as hereinafter
amended.
   (b)   Priority of Lien for Removal or Repair. If the Demolition Notice is
given by United States certified mail at least thirty (30) days prior to the
removal of the building or other structure to the property owners and the
holders of legal or equitable liens of record upon the real property on which
the building or other structure is located, if any, the lien provided for in
this section as a result of the removal or repair of the building or other
structure is effective on the date the City incurred the expenses of such
removal or repair. If for any reason the Demolition Notice is not given by
United States certified mail at least thirty (30) days prior to the removal of
the building or other structure to the property owners and the holders of legal
or equitable liens of record upon the real property on which the building or
other structure is located, if any, the lien provided for in this section as a
result of the removal or repair of the building or other structure is valid but
shall be subordinate to any liens of prior record. (Ord. 19-005. Passed 1-23-
19.)

1349.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective March 1, 2005, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1349.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1349.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, if any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
1349.04 COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.02)
   (b)   No architect, builder, engineer, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman or employee shall violate or assist in

Code, or fail to comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.03)
   (c)   No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration or
equipment of any building to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable until
the plans or drawings, specifications, and data have been approved as Ohio R.C.
3791.04 requires, or the industrialized unit inspected at the point of origin.
No plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented would, if constructed, repaired, erected, or
equipped comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rule made under those chapters. (ORC 3791.04)
1349.05 EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code shall control the
alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing

this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
1349.06 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Adjudication Orders Required Before Legal Proceedings. Before the
Municipality attempts to enforce Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section 
1349.07 . Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board. The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board. Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1349.07 , the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1349.07 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease
work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(OBC 114)
1349.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio. The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders
issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743, of the Ohio Revised Code
prevail in the event of a conflict.
(OBC 102)

blown down; or constructed of such materials or dimensions as to be dangerous
to the public by falling of structures in such a manner as to endanger the life
or limb of any person; or in such proximity to buildings as to increase the

the consent in writing, of the owners owning a majority of the frontage of the
property on both sides of the street in the block in which such billboard or
sign board is to be erected, constructed or located.
   Such written consent shall be filed with the Building Inspector before a
permit shall be issued for the erection, construction or location of such

1355.02 BUILDING REQUIREMENTS.
   The Safety-Service Director and the Building Inspector shall review all
building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements
to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding. If a proposed building site is in a location that has a flood hazard,
any proposed construction or substantial improvement (including prefabricated
and mobile homes) must:
   (a)    Be designed (or modified) and anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure;
   (b)    Use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant

1357.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Struthers, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Struthers has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Struthers as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by City of Struthers.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Mahoning County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Maps Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective November 18, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authorized by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Struthers as required by Section 
1357.04 (c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 6 Elm Street, Struthers, Ohio 44471.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statues. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a
state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Struthers, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management agency for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 09-
062. Passed 10-14-09.)

   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot width, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,

filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor”.
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or   
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (Shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps) and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus 1 (one) foot freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Struther’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Struthers Flood
Insurance Rate Map, November 19, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or
any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage; Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50
percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of construction”
of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred
“substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction”,
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 09-062. Passed 10-14-09.)

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Struthers flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1357.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.  
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1357.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA as provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Struthers, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Struthers have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Struthers Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Struthers boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Struthers suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Struthers has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard area where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increase
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary food hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1357.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements and
other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 09-062. Passed 10-14-09.)

methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; and
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1357.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation of why these alternatives
are not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Struthers and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
          A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulation,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage”. The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Struthers specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section 
1357.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

1357.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Struthers Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City
Code.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
City Hall at 6 Elm Street, Struthers, Ohio, 44471.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the propoerty; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increase flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations, of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 09-062. Passed 10-14-09.)

gasoline or other motor vehicle fuels and oil for delivery into automotive
vehicles and may include: the retail sale of lubricants, tires, batteries and
automotive accessories; the rendering of services and the making of adjustments
and replacements to motor vehicles; the washing, waxing and polishing of motor
vehicles as incidental to other services rendered; the washing of motor
vehicles with self-service coin-operated equipment without an independent
structure therefor; and the making of repairs to motor vehicles except repairs
of a major type which are defined to be spray painting, body, fender, clutch,
transmission, differential, axle, spring and frame repairs; major overhauling
of engines requiring the removal of engine cylinder head or crankcase pan;

(Ord. 6257. Passed 1-21-70.)
1505.02 NOTICE TO ABATE.
   If any service station becomes abandoned, such service station shall be
presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
property or general welfare of the community and shall be abated. "Abandoned"
means a failure to operate such service station for at least six consecutive
months in any eighteen month period.
   Whenever the Building Inspector finds any service station to be abandoned
within the meaning of this chapter, he shall give notice, in the same manner as
service of summons in civil cases, or by certified mail addressed to the owner
of record of the premises at his last known address or to the address to which
tax bills are sent or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such
abandoned condition within sixty days either by placing the station in
operation in accordance with this chapter, adapting and using the building for
another permitted business use, or by razing the service station structure,
removing the pumps and signs, abandoning underground storage tanks in
accordance with accepted safe practice as prescribed by the National Fire
Protection Association in Appendix C to N.F.P.A. No. 30, under the supervision
of the Fire Chief and filling depressions to the grade level of the lot;
provided, however, that if the station is in operation at the time notice is
given and remains in operation for ninety consecutive days thereafter, then
this chapter shall not become operative; and provided, further, that if there
should be declared a national emergency which would curtail the operation of
motor vehicles or if Council should determine that there exists a state of
general economic depression, the provisions of this chapter shall not apply.
   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the notice
to abate such abandonment, the Building Inspector shall take such action as may
be necessary to abate such nuisance.
   Inoperative service stations which do not come within the definition of
abandoned service station shall be maintained in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter and the owner shall cut all grass and remove all rubbish and
weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles upon such premises is
prohibited and the owner shall place in the window of such service station a
sign of at least ten square feet in area notifying the public of this fact.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if the Building Inspector
finds that such notice is not complied with by the public, he may order the
owner of the premises on which any station is inoperative for more than six
months to install fencing or barricade approved by the Building Inspector which
will be sufficient to block motor vehicle access to such property. (Ord. 6257.
Passed 1-21-70.)
1505.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever fails to abate or terminate or to comply with the provisions of this
chapter shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate offense and shall
subject such person, firm, corporation or partnership to a fine of not more
then one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisonment of not more than ten days.
