The City of Mt. Healthy shall have all the powers of local self-government and
the benefits of City home rule that may now or hereafter be lawfully possessed
or exercised by municipal corporations under the Constitution of the State of

Charter, or, to the extent not prescribed herein, in such manner as shall be
provided by ordinance or resolution of Council. Any such ordinance or rule
shall supersede and override state statutes.
SECTION 1.03   FORM OF GOVERNMENT
The form of government shall be known as the “Mayor-Council-Manager Plan.” The

§ 31.02 MEMBERS OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY.
   The legislative power of the city shall be vested in, and exercised by, the
legislative authority, composed of not fewer than seven members elected by
electors of the city at large.

   (A)   Members of the legislative authority at large shall have resided in
the city for at least one year immediately preceding their election. Each
member of the legislative authority shall be an elector of the city, shall not
hold any other public office, except that of notary public or member of the
state militia, and shall not be interested in any contract with the city, and
no such member may hold employment with the city. A member who ceases to
possess any of such qualifications, or removes from his ward, if elected from a
ward, or from the city, if elected from the city at large, shall forthwith
forfeit his office.
   (B)   The purpose of establishing a one-year residency requirement in this
section is to recognize that the state has a substantial and compelling
interest in encouraging qualified candidacies for election to the office of
member of the legislative authority of a city by ensuring that a candidate for
such office has every opportunity to become knowledgeable with and concerned
about the problems and needs of the area he seeks to represent. In enacting
this requirement, the general assembly finds that the one-year period is
reasonably related to this purpose, while leaving unimpaired a person’s right
to travel, to vote, and to be a candidate for public office.

(R.C. § 1905.21) (‘74 Code, § 32.04)
§ 32.022 MAYOR’S COURT MAGISTRATE.
   (A)   A Mayor of a municipality that has a Mayor’s Court may appoint a
person as Mayor’s Court Magistrate to hear and determine prosecutions and
criminal cases in the Mayor’s Court that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01. No person shall be appointed as
a Mayor’s Court Magistrate unless the person has been admitted to the practice
of law in this state and, for a total of at least three years preceding his or
her appointment or the commencement of his or her service as magistrate, has
been engaged in the practice of law in this state or served as a judge of a
court of record in any jurisdiction in the United States, or both.
      (1)   A person appointed as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under this
division is entitled to hear and determine prosecutions and criminal cases in
the Mayor’s Court that are within the jurisdiction of the Mayor’s Court, as set
forth in R.C. § 1905.01. If a Mayor is prohibited from hearing or determining a
prosecution or cause that charges a person with a violation of R.C. § 4511.19
or a municipal OVI ordinance as defined in R.C. § 4511.181 due to the operation
of R.C. § 1905.03(C), or is prohibited from hearing or determining any other
prosecution or cause due to the operation of R.C. § 1905.031(C), the
prohibition against the Mayor hearing or determining the prosecution or causes
does not affect and shall not be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or
authority of a person appointed as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under this
division to hear and determine the prosecution or cause in accordance with this
section. In hearing and determining such prosecutions and causes, the
magistrate has the same powers, duties, and authority as does a Mayor who
conducts a Mayor’s Court to hear and determine prosecutions and causes in
general, including, but not limited to, the power and authority to decide the
prosecution or cause, enter judgement, and impose sentence; the powers, duties,
and authority granted to Mayors of Mayor’s Courts by this chapter, in relation
to the hearing and determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor’s Courts;
and the powers, duties, and authority granted to Mayors of Mayor’s Courts by
any provisions of the Revised Code, in relation to the hearing and
determination of prosecutions and causes in Mayor’s Courts. A judgement entered
and a sentence imposed by a Mayor’s Court Magistrate do not have to be reviewed
or approved by the Mayor who appointed the Magistrate, and have the same force
and effect as if they had been entered or imposed by the Mayor.
      (2)   A person appointed as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under this
division is not entitled to hear or determine any prosecution or criminal cause
other than prosecutions and causes that are within the jurisdiction of the
Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.
      (3)   A municipality that a Mayor’s Court Magistrate serves shall pay the
compensation for the services of the Magistrate, which shall be either a fixed
annual salary set by the Legislative Authority or a fixed annual amount or fees
for services rendered set under a contract the Magistrate and the municipality
enter into.
   (B)   The appointment of a person as a Mayor’s Court Magistrate under
division (A) of this section does not preclude the Mayor that appointed the
Magistrate, subject to the limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.03 and the
limitation contained in R.C. § 1905.031, from also hearing and determining
prosecutions and criminal causes in the Mayor’s Court that are within the
jurisdiction of the Mayor’s Court, as set forth in R.C. § 1905.01.

or relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol,
a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, or in hearing a criminal cause
involving a violation of R.C. § 4511.19 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, determines that the person charged, within ten years of the
violation charged, has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation
listed in division (B)(1)(a), (B)(1)(b), (B)(1)(c), or (B)(1)(d) of this
section, the Mayor immediately shall transfer the case to the county court or
municipal court with jurisdiction over the violation charged, in accordance
with R.C. § 1905.032.
   (C)   (1)   In all municipalities having a population of more than 200 not
being the site of a municipal court and not being a place where a judge of a
court listed in division (A) of this section sits as required pursuant to R.C.
§ 1901.021 or by designation of the judges pursuant to R.C. § 1901.021, the

continuance in the proceedings to secure counsel;
   (C)   Inform the accused of the effect of pleas of guilty, not guilty, and
no contest, of his right to trial by jury, and the necessity of making written
demand therefor;
   (D)   If the charge be a felony, inform the accused of the nature and extent
of possible punishment on conviction and of the right to preliminary hearing.
Such information may be given to each accused individually or, if at any time

session, the judge or magistrate may, by general announcement or by
distribution of printed matter, advise all those accused concerning those
rights general in their nature, and informing as to individual matters at
arraignment.

32.060 herein) the accused shall be arraigned by the magistrate, clerk, or
prosecutor of the court reading the affidavit or complaint, or reading its
substance, omitting purely formal parts, to the accused unless the reading of
the affidavit or complaint is waived. The judge or magistrate shall then
inquire of the accused whether the accused understands the nature of the
charge. If the accused does not indicate understanding, the judge or magistrate
shall give explanation in terms of the statute or ordinance claimed violated.
If the accused is not represented by counsel and expresses a desire to consult
with an attorney at law, the judge or magistrate shall continue the case for a
reasonable time to allow the accused to send for or consult with counsel and
shall set bail for the later appearance if the offense is bailable. If the
accused is not able to make bail, bail is denied, or the offense is not
bailable, the court or magistrate shall require the officer having custody of
the accused immediately to take a message to any attorney at law within the
municipal corporation where the accused is detained, or immediately to make
available to accused use of a telephone for calling to arrange for legal
counsel or bail.
(R.C. § 2937.03) (‘74 Code, § 32.26)
§ 32.062 MOTION FOR DISMISSAL; DISCHARGE; AMENDMENT OF COMPLAINT.
   (A)   If accused does not desire counsel or, having engaged counsel, appears
at the end of granted continuance, he may then raise, by motion to dismiss the
affidavit or complaint, any exception thereto which could be asserted against
an indictment or information by motion to quash, plea in abatement, demurrer.
Such motion may be made orally and ruled upon by the court or magistrate at the
time of presentation, with minute of motion and ruling made in the journal (if
a court of record) or on the docket (if a court not of record) or such motion
may be presented in writing and set down for argument at later time. Where the
motion attacks a defect in the record by facts extrinsic thereto, proof may be
offered by testimony or affidavit.
(R.C. § 2937.04) (‘74 Code, § 32.27)
   (B)   If the motion pursuant to R.C. § 2937.04 (division (A) above) be
sustained, accused shall be discharged unless the court or magistrate finds
that the defect can be corrected without changing the nature of the charge, in
which case he may order the complaint amended or a proper affidavit filed
forthwith and require the accused to plead thereto. The discharge of accused
upon the sustaining of a motion to dismiss shall not be considered a bar to
further prosecution either of a felony or misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2937.05) (‘74 Code, § 32.28)
§ 32.063 PLEAS.
   (A)   Pleas; general.

         (b)   Not guilty;
         (c)   No contest;
         (d)   Once in jeopardy, which includes the defenses of former
conviction or former acquittal.
      (2)   Prior to accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest under
division (A), the court shall comply with R.C. § 2943.031 and 2943.032.
      (3)   Entry of any plea pursuant to this section shall constitute a
waiver of any objection which could be taken advantage of by motion pursuant to
R.C. § 2937.04 (§
32.062(A) herein).
(R.C. § 2937.06) (‘74 Code, § 32.29)
   (B)   Pleas of “guilty” and “no contest.”
      (1)   If the offense be a misdemeanor and the accused pleads guilty
thereto, the court or magistrate shall receive and enter such plea unless he
believes it made through fraud, collusion; or mistake in which case he shall
enter a plea of not guilty and set the matter for trial pursuant to R.C. Ch.
2938. Upon a plea of guilty being received the court or magistrate shall call
for explanation of circumstances of the offense from the affiant or complainant
or his representatives, and after hearing the same, together with any statement
of accused, shall proceed to pronounce sentence or continue the matter for the
purpose of imposing sentence or admitting the defendant to probation.
      (2)   If the plea be “no contest” or words of similar import in pleading
to a misdemeanor, it shall constitute a stipulation that the judge or
magistrate may make finding of guilty or not guilty from the explanation of
circumstances, and if guilt be found, impose or continue for sentence
accordingly. Such plea shall not be construed to import an admission of any
fact at issue in the criminal charge in any subsequent action or proceeding,
whether civil or criminal.
(R.C. § 2937.07) (‘74 Code, § 32.30)
   (C)   Action on pleas of “not guilty” or “once in jeopardy.”
      (1)   Upon the entry of such pleas to a charge of misdemeanor in a court
not of record, the magistrate shall forthwith set the matter for future trial
or, with the consent of both state and defendant may set trial forthwith, both
pursuant to R.C. Ch. 2938., provided that if the nature of the offense is such
that right to jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before him
unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury trial and
consents to be tried by the magistrate.
      (2)   If the defendant in such event does not waive right to jury trial,
then the magistrate shall require the accused to enter into recognizance to
appear before a court of record in the county, set by such magistrate, and the
magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with transcript
of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance if given, to
such designated court of record. Such transfer shall not require the filing of
indictment or information and trial shall proceed in the transferee court
pursuant to R.C. Ch. 2938.

of common pleas; provided that in juvenile courts, where the conduct of any
person under the age of 18 years is made the subject of inquiry and for which
special provision is made by R.C. Ch. 2151, such matters shall be tried,
adjusted, or disposed of pursuant to R.C. Ch. 2151.

   (A)   A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until he
is proved guilty of the offense charged, and in case of a reasonable doubt
whether his guilt is satisfactorily shown, he shall be acquitted. The
presumption of innocence places upon the state (or the municipality) the burden
of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
   (B)   In charging a jury, the trial court shall state the meaning of the
presumption of innocence and of reasonable doubt in each case.

by which he expects to sustain it.
   (B)   Counsel for the defendant may state his defense including the evidence

side out of its order and may permit rebuttal evidence to be offered by the
prosecution.
   (D)   When the evidence is concluded, unless the case is submitted without

   A person being tried for a misdemeanor, upon request in writing, subscribed
by him, may, with the consent of the magistrate, be tried in his absence, but

paid, or the offender is legally discharged. Such confinement shall accrue at a
basis of $30 per day or per fractional day toward satisfying such fine as

§ 32.096 CONDITIONAL SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   In determining whether to suspend sentence of imprisonment
imposed upon an offender for a misdemeanor and place the offender on probation
or whether to otherwise suspend a sentence of imprisonment imposed upon an
offender for a misdemeanor pursuant to R.C. § 2929.51 (A), the court shall
consider the risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need
for protecting the public from the risk, the nature and circumstances of the
offense, and the history, character, and condition of the offender.
      (2)   An offender who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor shall not be placed on probation and shall not otherwise have the
sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the offender suspended pursuant to R.C. §
2929.51(A) if any of the following applies:
         (a)   The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender, as defined in
R.C. § 2935.36.
         (b)   The misdemeanor offense involved was not a violation of R.C. §
2923.12 and was committed while the offender was armed with a firearm or
dangerous ordnance, as defined in R.C. § 2923.11.
         (c)   Under R.C. § 2903.07(C), the offender is not eligible for
probation.
   (B)   The following do not control the court’s discretion, but the court
shall consider them in favor of placing an offender who has been convicted of
or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor on probation in favor of otherwise
suspending the offender’s sentence of imprisonment pursuant to R.C. § 2929.51
(A):
      (1)   The offense neither caused nor threatened serious harm to persons
or property, or the offender did not contemplate that it would do so.
      (2)   The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.
      (3)   The victim of the offense induced or facilitated it.
      (4)   There are substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the
offense, though failing to establish a defense.
      (5)   The offender acted under strong provocation.
      (6)   The offender has no history of prior delinquency or criminal
activity, or has led a law- abiding life for a substantial period before
commission of the present offense.
      (7)   The offender is likely to respond affirmatively to probationary or
other court-imposed treatment.
      (8)   The character and attitudes of the offender indicate that the
offender is unlikely to commit another offense.
      (9)   The offender has made or will make restitution or reparation to the
victim of the offender’s offense for the injury, damage, or loss sustained.
      (10)   Imprisonment of the offender will entail undue hardship to the
offender or the offender’s dependents.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   When an offender who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor is placed on probation or the sentence of that type of
offender otherwise is suspended pursuant to R.C. § 2929.51 (A), the probation
or other suspension shall be at least on condition that, during the period of
probation or other suspension, the offender shall abide by the law, including,
but not limited to, complying with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2923 relating
to the possession, sale, furnishing, transfer, disposition, purchase,
acquisition, carrying, conveying, or use of, or other conduct involving, a
firearm or dangerous ordnance, as defined in R.C. § 2923.11, and shall not
leave the state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation
officer. In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and
ensuring the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional
requirements on the offender, including, but not limited to, requiring the
offender to make restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.21 for all or part of the
property damage that is caused by the offender’s offense and for all or part of
the value of the property that is the subject of any theft offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2913.01 (K), that the offender committed. Compliance with the
additional requirements shall also be a condition of the offender’s probation
or other suspension.
         (b)   When an offender who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
a felony is sentenced to a nonresidential sanction pursuant to R.C. § 2929.17,
the court shall impose as a condition of the sanction that, during the period
of the nonresidential sanction, the offender shall abide by the law, including
but not limited to, complying with the provisions of R.C. Chapter 2923
identified in division (C)(1)(a) of this section.
      (2)   During the period of a misdemeanor offender’s probation or other
suspension or during the period of a felon’s nonresidential sanction,
authorized probation officers who are engaged within the scope of their
supervisory duties or responsibilities may search, with or without a warrant,
the person of the offender, the place of residence of the offender, and a motor
vehicle, another item of tangible or intangible personal property, or other
real property in which the offender has a right, title, or interest or for
which the offender has the express or implied permission of a person with a
right, title, or interest to use, occupy, or possess if the probation officers
have reasonable grounds to believe that, the offender is not abiding by the law
or otherwise is not complying with the conditions of the offender’s probation
or other suspension or the conditions of the offender’s nonresidential
sanction. If a felon who is sentenced to a nonresidential sanction is under the
general control and supervision of the adult parole authority, as described in
R.C. § 2929.15 (A)(2)(a), adult parole authority field officers with
supervisory responsibilities over the felon shall have the same search
authority relative to the felon during the period of the sanction as is
described under this division for probation officers. The court that places the
offender on probation or suspends the misdemeanor offender’s sentence of
imprisonment pursuant to R.C.§ 2929.51 (D)(2) or (4) or that sentences the
felon to a nonresidential sanction pursuant to R.C. § 2929.17 shall provide the
offender with a written notice that informs the offender that authorized
probation officers or adult parole authority field officers with supervisory
responsibilities over the offender who are engaged within the scope of their
supervisory duties or responsibilities may conduct those types of searches
during the period of probation or other suspension or during the period of the
nonresidential sanction if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the
offender is not abiding by the law or otherwise is not complying with the
conditions of the offender’s probation or other suspension or the conditions of
the offender’s nonresidential sanction.
   (D)   The following do not control the court’s discretion, but the court
shall consider them against placing an offender who has been convicted of or
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor on probation and against otherwise suspending
an offender’s sentence of imprisonment pursuant to R.C. § 2929.51 (A);
      (1)   The offender recently violated the conditions of pardon, post-
release control pursuant to R.C. § 2967.28, or a probation or suspension
pursuant to R.C. § 2929.51 (A), previously granted the offender.
      (2)   There is a substantial risk that, while at liberty during the
period of probation or other suspension, the offender will commit another
offense.
      (3)   The offender is in need of correctional or rehabilitative treatment
that can be provided best by the offender’s commitment to a locally governed
and operated residential facility.
      (4)   Regardless of whether the offender knew the age of the victim, the
victim of the offense was 65 years of age or older or permanently and totally
disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.
   (E)   The criteria listed in divisions (B) and (D) of this section shall not
be construed to limit the matters that may be considered in determining whether
to suspend sentence of imprisonment and place an offender who has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor on probation or whether to
otherwise suspend the offender’s sentence of imprisonment pursuant to R.C. §
2929.51 (A).
   (F)   (1)   When an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor, the court may require the offender, as a condition of probation or
as a condition of otherwise suspending the offender’s sentence pursuant to R.C.
§ 2929.51(A), in addition to the conditions of probation or other suspension
imposed pursuant to division (C) of this section, to perform supervised
community service work under the authority of health districts, park districts,
counties, municipal corporations, townships, other political subdivisions of
the state, or agencies of the state or any of its political subdivisions, or
under the authority of charitable organizations that render services to the
community or its citizens, in accordance with this division. Supervised
community service work shall not be required as a condition of probation or
other suspension under this division unless the offender agrees to perform the
work offered as a condition of probation or other suspension by the court. The
court may require an offender who agrees to perform the work to pay to it a
reasonable fee to cover the costs of the offender’s participation in the work,
including, but not limited to, the costs of procuring a policy or policies of
insurance to cover the period during which the offender will perform the work.
A court may permit any offender convicted of a misdemeanor to satisfy the
payment of a fine imposed for the offense by performing supervised community
service work as described in this division if the offender requests an
opportunity to satisfy the payment by this means and if the court determines
the offender is financially unable to pay the fine. The supervised community
service work that may be imposed under this division shall be subject to the
following limitations:
         (a)   The court shall fix the period of the work and, if necessary,
shall distribute it over weekends or over other appropriate times that will
allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or to care for the
offender’s family. The period of the work as fixed by the court shall not
exceed an aggregate of 200 hours.
         (b)   An agency, political subdivision, or charitable organization
must agree to accept the offender for the work before the court requires the
offender to perform the work for the entity. A court shall not require an
offender to perform supervised community service work for an agency, political
subdivision, or charitable organization at a location that is an unreasonable
distance from the offender’s residence or domicile, unless the offender is
provided with transportation to the location where the work is to be performed.
         (c)   A court may enter into an agreement with a county department of
human services for the management, placement, and supervision of offenders
eligible for community service work in work activities, developmental
activities, and alternative work activities under R.C. §§ 5107.40 to 5107.69.
If a court and a county department of human services have entered into an
agreement of that nature, the clerk of that court is authorized to pay directly
to the department of human services all or a portion of the fees collected by
the court pursuant to this division in accordance with the terms of its
agreement.
         (d)   Community service work that a court requires under this division
shall be supervised by an official of the agency, political subdivision, or
charitable organization for which the work is performed or by a person
designated by the agency, political subdivision, or charitable organization.
The official or designated person shall be qualified for the supervision by
education, training, or experience, and periodically shall report, in writing,
to the court and to the offender’s probation officer concerning the conduct of
the offender in performing the work.
      (2)   When an offender is convicted of a felony, the court may impose
pursuant to R.C. §§ 2929.15 and 2929.17 a sanction that requires the offender
to perform supervised community service work in accordance with this division
and under the authority of any agency, political subdivision, or charitable
organization as described in division (F)(1) of this section. The court may
require an offender who is ordered to perform the work to pay to it a
reasonable fee to cover the costs of the offender’s participation in the work,
including, but not limited to, the costs of procuring a policy or policies of
liability insurance to cover the period during which the offender will perform
the work. A court may permit an offender convicted of a felony to satisfy the
payment of a fine imposed for the offense pursuant to R.C. § 2929.18 by
performing supervised community service work as described in this division if
the court determines that the offender is financially unable to pay the fine.
The supervised community service work that may be imposed under this division
shall be subject to the limitations specified in divisions (F)(1)(a) to (d) of
this section, except that the court is not required to obtain the agreement of
the offender to impose supervised community work as a sanction. Additionally,
the total of any period of supervised community service work imposed on an
offender under this division plus the period of all other sanctions imposed
pursuant to R.C. §§ 2929.15, 2929.16, 2929.17, and 2929.18 shall not exceed
five years.
   (G)   (1)   When an offender is convicted of a violation of R.C. § 4511.19,
a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of
alcohol in the blood, breath, or urine or of a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2903.07 or an equivalent violation of a municipal ordinance that is
substantially similar to R.C. § 2903.07 and that provides for that type of
finding by a jury or judge in a case in which the jury or judge found that the
offender was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the commission of
the offense, the court may require, as a condition of probation in addition to
the required conditions of probation and the discretionary conditions of
probation that may be imposed pursuant to division (C) of this section, any
suspension or revocation of a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege, and all other penalties provided by law or
by ordinance, that the offender operate only a motor vehicle equipped with an
ignition interlock device that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 4511.83.
      (2)   When a court requires an offender, as a condition of probation
pursuant to division (G)(1) of this section, to operate only a motor vehicle
equipped with an ignition interlock device that is certified pursuant to R.C. §
4511.83, the offender immediately shall surrender the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit to the court. Upon the receipt of the
offender’s license or permit, the court shall issue an order authorizing the
offender to operate a motor vehicle equipped with a certified ignition
interlock device, deliver the offender’s license or permit to the bureau of
motor vehicles, and include in the abstract of the case forwarded to the bureau
pursuant to R.C. § 4507.021 the conditions of probation imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1) of this section. The court shall give the offender a copy, of
its order, and that copy shall be used by the offender in lieu of a driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit until the bureau issues a restricted
license to the offender.
      (3)   Upon receipt of an offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit pursuant to division (G)(2) of this section, the bureau of
motor vehicles shall issue a restricted license to the offender. The restricted
license shall be identical to the surrendered license, except that it shall
have printed on its face a statement that the offender is prohibited from
operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock
device that is certified pursuant to R.C. § 4511.83. The bureau shall deliver
the offender’s surrendered license or permit to the court upon receipt of a
court order requiring it to do so, or reissue the offender’s license or permit
under R.C. § 4507.54 if the registrar destroyed the offender’s license or
permit under that section. The offender shall surrender the restricted license
to the court upon receipt of the offender’s surrendered license or permit.
      (4)   If an offender violates a requirement of the court imposed under
division (G)(1) of this section, the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege may be suspended as
provided in R.C. § 4507.16.
      (5)   As used in this division, IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE has the same
meaning as in R.C. § 4511.83.
(R.C. § 2951.02)
   (H)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when imprisonment is
imposed for a misdemeanor, the court may do any of the following:
      (1)   Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant
to R.C. § 2951.02;
      (2)   Suspend the sentence pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 upon any terms that
the court considers appropriate;
      (3)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at any other
time or times that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s
occupation or care for the offender’s family;
      (4)   Require the offender to serve a portion of the offender’s sentence,
which may be served in intermittent confinement, and suspend the balance of the
sentence pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 upon any terms that the court considers
appropriate, or suspend the balance of the sentence and place the offender on
probation pursuant to that section.
   (I)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a term of
imprisonment is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2919.25, a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2919.27 involving a protection order issued or
consent agreement approved pursuant to R.C. § 2919.26 or R.C. § 3113.31, or a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor violation of either of those sections, and when the court has
reason to believe, based on an evaluation performed pursuant to R.C. § 2919.271
or on the advice of a chemical dependency professional, that the offender is a
drug dependent person, is in danger of becoming a drug dependent person, is an
alcoholic, or is suffering from acute alcohol intoxication, as defined in R.C.
§ 2935.33, the court may require the offender to serve a portion of the
offender’s sentence and suspend the balance of the sentence and place the
offender on probation pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02, with one of the conditions of
probation being that the offender enter into an appropriate treatment program
or facility and comply with the treatment prescribed at the program or
facility. The court shall order a person to enter a particular program or
facility under this division only if the court has received evidence that the
program or facility has space available and that the treatment provided by the
program or facility is appropriate. For purposes of this division, an
appropriate treatment program or facility includes a program licensed by the
director of alcohol and drug addiction services pursuant to R.C. § 3793.11, a
program certified by the director of alcohol and drug addiction services
pursuant to R.C. § 3793.06, a public or private hospital, the veterans
administration or other agencies of the federal government, or private care or
treatment rendered by a physician or a psychologist licensed in the state, a
licensed independent social worker, a licensed professional clinical counselor,
or a certified chemical dependency counselor. For purposes of this division,
the fact that an offender is a repeat offender, as defined in R.C. § 2935.36,
shall not conclusively bar the offender from conditional probation under this
division if the previous offenses for which the offender was imprisoned
involved misdemeanor violations of R.C. § 2919.25, misdemeanor violations of
R.C. § 2919.27 involving a protection order issued or consent agreement
approved pursuant to R.C. § 2919.26 or R.C. § 3113.31, or equivalent
misdemeanor violations of substantially equivalent municipal ordinances or
would have been violations of either of those sections had they been in effect
at the time of the violations.
   (J)   At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when a fine is imposed
for a misdemeanor, the court may do either of the following:
      (1)   Suspend all or any portion of the fine, upon any conditions that
the court imposes in the interests of justice and the correction and
rehabilitation of the offender;
      (2)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the fine in installments,
or by any other method and in any time and on any terms that the court
considers just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment shall not
exceed two years.

section of the Ohio Revised Code, all fines collected from, and all moneys
arising from bonds forfeited by, persons arrested under R.C. § 2935.03(E)(3)
are deemed to be collected, and to arise, from arrests made within the

by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the
employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority. The
following are full defenses to that liability:

inspecting the bridge.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 3746.24, political
subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that
is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the
grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of,
buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental
function, including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses, but

not limited to, R.C. §§ 2743.02 and 5591.37. Civil liability shall not be
construed to exist under another section of this code or the Revised Code
merely because that section imposes a responsibility or mandatory duty, because
that section provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general
authorization in that section that a political subdivision may sue and be sued,
or because that section uses the term “shall” in a provision pertaining to a
political subdivision.
   (C)   An order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a
political subdivision the benefit of an alleged immunity from liability as
provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.

employee of a political subdivision to recover damages for injury, death, or
loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function, the following defenses
or immunities may be asserted to establish nonliability:
      (1)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the employee
involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial,
prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function.
      (2)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the conduct
of the employee involved, other than negligent conduct, that gave rise to the

of the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of liability was necessary
or essential to the exercise of powers of the political subdivision or
employee.
      (3)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the employee involved that gave rise to the claim of
liability was within the discretion of the employee with respect to policy
making, planning, or enforcement powers by virtue of the duties and
responsibilities of the office or position of the employee.
      (4)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the action or
failure to act by the political subdivision or employee involved that gave rise
to the claim of liability, resulted in injury or death to a person who had been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who, at the time of
the injury or death, was serving any portion of his or her sentence by
performing community service work for or in the political subdivision whether
pursuant to R.C. § 2951.02 or otherwise, or resulted in injury or death to a
child who was found to be a delinquent child and who, at the time of the injury
or death, was performing community service or community work for or in a
political subdivision in accordance with the order of a juvenile court entered
pursuant to R.C. § 2151.355, and if, at the time of that person’s or child’s
injury or death, the person or child was covered for purposes of R.C. Chapter
4123 in connection with the community service or community work for or in the
political subdivision.
      (5)   The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,
death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of judgment or
discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment,
supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources, unless the
judgment or discretion was exercised with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or
in a wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in division (A)
(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that division or R.C.

faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;
         (c)   Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a
section of the Revised Code. Civil liability shall not be construed to exist
under another section of the Revised Code merely because that section imposes a
responsibility or mandatory duty upon an employee, because that section
provides for a criminal penalty, because of a general authorization in that
section that an employee may sue and be sued, or because the section uses the
term “shall” in a provision pertaining to an employee.
      (7)   The political subdivision, and an employee who is the Chief Legal
Officer of a political subdivision, an assistant of any such person, or a judge
of a court of this state, is entitled to any defense or immunity available at
common law or established by the Revised Code.
   (B)   Any immunity or defense conferred upon, or referred to in connection
with, an employee by division (A)(6) or (7) of this section does not affect or
limit any liability of a political subdivision for an act or omission of the
employee as provided in §
36.02 above.

omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, whether
filed in an original action, cross-claim, counterclaim, third- party claim, or

§ 36.05 DAMAGES.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Revised Code or rules of a
court to the contrary, in an action against a political subdivision to recover
damages for injury, death or loss to person or property caused by an act or
omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary function, punitive or
exemplary damages shall not be awarded.
   (B)   (1)   If a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits for
injuries or loss allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or
any other source, the benefits shall be disclosed to the court, and the amount
of the benefits shall be deducted from any award against a political
subdivision recovered by the claimant. No insurer or other person is entitled
to bring an action under a subrogation provision in an insurance or other
contract against a political subdivision with respect to those benefits. The
amount of the benefits shall be deducted from an award against a political
subdivision under division (B)(1) of this section regardless of whether the
claimant may be under an obligation to pay back the benefits upon recovery, in
whole or in part, for the claim. A claimant whose benefits have been deducted
from an award under division (B)(1) of this section is not considered fully
compensated and shall not be required to reimburse a subrogated claim for
benefits deducted from an award pursuant to division (B)(1) of this section.
      (2)   Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section shall be construed to do
either of the following:

represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded the damages. However,
except in wrongful death actions brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2125, damages
that arise from the same cause of action, transaction or occurrence, or series
of transactions or occurrences and that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages shall not exceed $250,000 in favor of any one
person. The limitation on damages that do not represent the actual loss of the
person who is awarded the damages provided in this section does not apply to
court costs that are awarded to a plaintiff, or to interest on a judgment
rendered in favor of a plaintiff, in an action against a political subdivision.
      (2)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS

            6.   Any other expenditures of the person injured or of the person
whose property was injured or destroyed or of another person on behalf of the
person injured or of the person whose property was injured or destroyed that
the court determines represent an actual loss experienced because of the
personal or property injury or property loss.
         (b)   THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS AWARDED THE DAMAGES does
not include any fees paid or owed to an attorney for any services rendered in
relation to a personal or property injury or property loss, and does not
include any damages awarded for pain and suffering, for the loss of society,

subdivision or any of its employees in connection with a governmental or
proprietary function. Those judgments shall be paid from funds of the political
subdivisions that have been appropriated for that purpose, but, if sufficient
funds are not currently appropriated for the payment of judgments, the fiscal
officer of a political subdivision shall certify the amount of any unpaid
judgments to the taxing authority of the political subdivision for inclusion in
the next succeeding budget and annual appropriation measure and payment in the
next succeeding fiscal year as provided by R.C. § 5705.08, unless any judgment
of that nature is to be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to R.C.
§ 133.14 or pursuant to annual installments authorized by divisions (B) or (C)
of this section.
   (B)   (1)   (a)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO

         (b)   As used in this section, THE ACTUAL LOSS OF THE PERSON WHO IS
AWARDED THE DAMAGES does not include any of the following:
            1.   Wages, salaries, or other compensation lost by the person
injured as a result of the injury that are future expected earnings of that
person;
            2.   Expenditures to be incurred in the future, as determined by
the court, by the person injured or by another person on behalf of the person
injured for medical care or treatment, for rehabilitation services, or for

      (2)   (a)   Except as specifically provided to the contrary in this
section, a court that renders a judgment against a political subdivision as
described in division (A) of this section and that is not in favor of the state
may authorize the political subdivision, upon the motion of the political
subdivision, to pay the judgment or a specified portion of the judgment in
annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years, subject to the
payment of interest at the rate specified in R.C. § 1343.03(A). A court shall
not authorize the payment in installments under this division of any portion of
a judgment or entire judgment that represents the actual loss of the person who
is awarded the damages.
         (b)   Additionally, a court shall not authorize the payment in
installments under this division of any portion of a judgment or entire
judgment that does not represent the actual loss of the person who is awarded
the damages unless the court, after balancing the interests of the political
subdivision and of the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered,
determines that installment payments would be appropriate under the
circumstances and would not be unjust to the person in whose favor the judgment
was rendered. If a court makes that determination, it shall fix the amount of
the installment payments in a manner that achieves for the person in whose
favor the judgment was rendered the same economic result over the period as
that person would have received if the judgment or portion of the judgment
subject to the installment payments had been paid in a lump sum payment.
   (C)   At the option of a political subdivision, a judgment as described in
division (A) of this section and that is rendered in favor of the state may be
paid in equal annual installments over a period not to exceed ten years,
without the payment of interest.

§ 36.07 DEFENDING AND INDEMNIFYING EMPLOYEES.
   (A)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (A)(2) of this section,
a political subdivision
shall provide for the defense of an employee, in any state or federal court, in

with respect to any claim for injury, death, or loss to person or property
caused by an act or omission in connection with a governmental or proprietary
function.
      (2)   No action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any person,

§ 36.08 LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (A)   (1)   A political subdivision may use public funds to secure insurance
with respect to its and its employees’ potential liability in damages in civil
actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property allegedly caused by
an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of its employees in
connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The insurance may be at
the limits, for the circumstances, and subject to the terms and conditions,
that are determined by the political subdivision in its discretion. The
insurance may be for the period of time that is set forth in specifications for
competitive bids or, when competitive bidding is not required, for the period
of time that is mutually agreed upon by the political subdivision and insurance
company. The period of time does not have to be, but can be, limited to the
fiscal cycle under which the political subdivision is funded and operated.
      (2)   (a)   Regardless of whether a political subdivision procures a
policy of liability insurance pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section or
otherwise, the political subdivision may establish and maintain a self-
insurance program relative to its and its employees’ potential liability in
damages in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to persons or property
allegedly caused by an act or omission of the political subdivision or any of
its employees in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. The
political subdivision may reserve such funds as it deems appropriate in a
special fund that may be established pursuant to an ordinance or resolution of
the political subdivision and not subject to R.C. § 5705.12. The political
subdivision may allocate the costs of insurance of a self-insurance program, or
both, among the funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury on the basis of
relative exposure and loss experience. The political subdivision may require
any deductibles under an insurance or self- insurance program, or both, to be
paid from funds or accounts in the subdivision’s treasury from which a loss was
directly attributable. If it so chooses, the political subdivision may contract
with any person, other political subdivision, or regional council of
governments for purposes of the administration of such program.
         (b)   Political subdivisions that have established self-insurance
programs relative to their and their employees’ potential liability as
described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section may mutually agree that their
self-insurance programs will be jointly administered in a specific manner.
   (B)   The purchase of liability insurance, or the establishment and
maintenance of a self-insurance program, by a political subdivision does not
constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or
its employees, except that the political subdivision may specifically waive any
immunity or defense to which it or its employees may be entitled if a provision
to that effect is specifically included in the policy of insurance or in a
written plan of operation of the self-insurance program, or if any, the
legislative enactment of the political subdivision authorizing the purchase of
the insurance or the establishment and maintenance of the self-insurance
program. Such a specific waiver shall be only to the extent of the insurance or
self-insurance program coverage.
   (C)   The authorizations for political subdivisions to secure insurance and
to establish and maintain self- insurance programs in this section are in
addition to any other authority to secure insurance or to establish and
maintain self-insurance programs that is granted pursuant to the Revised Code
or the Ohio Constitution, and they are not in derogation of any other
authorization.
(R.C. § 2744.08) (‘74 Code, § 36.07)
   (D)   If a political subdivision, pursuant to division (A)(2)(a) of this
section or a joint self-insurance pool pursuant to R.C. § 2744.081, has
allocated costs to, or required the payment of deductibles from, funds or
accounts in the subdivision’s treasury, the subdivisions’s fiscal officer,
pursuant to ordinance or resolution of the Legislative Authority, shall
transfer amounts equal to those costs or deductibles from the funds or accounts
of the subdivision’s General Fund if both of the following occur:
      (1)   The subdivision requests payment from the employee responsible for
the funds or accounts for those costs or deductibles;
      (2)   The employee receiving the request fails to remit payment within 45
days after the date of receipt of the request.
   (E)   The provisions of R.C. §§ 5705.14, 5705.15, and 5705.16 do not apply
to transfers made pursuant to division (D) of this section.

taxable by the municipal corporation under R.C. § 718.011.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
      (4)   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
divisions (B)(1), (2), and (3) hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as
are applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained
by the number of percentages used in deriving said total.
   (C)   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned entirely in
or outside the municipality.
   (D)   Provided, however, that in the event a just and equitable result
cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula provided
for herein, the Finance Director, upon application of the taxpayer, shall have
the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a
fair and proper apportionment.
   (E)   As used in this section, SALES MADE IN A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION means:

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property delivered within such
municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within
such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal corporation

employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.

activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to tax only

municipality and, except as otherwise provided in R.C. § 718.01, the
municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by residents of the
municipality to the extent allowed by the United States Constitution.

apportioned to the municipality, may be applied against the portion of the
profit of succeeding tax years apportioned to the municipality until exhausted,
but in no event for more than the three taxable years immediately following the
year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating loss shall be
carried back against net profits of any prior year.
   (B)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be apportioned to
the municipality in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning net

in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
   (D)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity, by
any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry-
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
   (E)   The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is not
deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward. However, if a
taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity
(except any portion of a loss reportable for municipal income tax purposes to
another municipality) may be used to offset the profits of another for purposes
of arriving at overall net profits.

RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX
§ 39.035 DATES AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Mandatory filing. On or before April 15 of each year, every resident
subject to the provisions of this chapter shall, except as hereinafter
provided, make and file with the Finance Director a municipal tax return on a
form prescribed by and acceptable to the Finance Director, whether or not a tax
is due. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or period. The
Finance Director is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return
of an employer or employers, showing the amount of municipal tax deducted by
said employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, or other
compensation, and other taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by
him or them to the Finance Director, may be accepted as the return required of
a nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this chapter, is
such qualifying wages, commissions, or other compensation, and other taxable
income.
   (B)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the municipal return, regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
city return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (C)   The return shall be filed with the Finance Director on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Finance Director; or on a
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the municipality’s prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with this chapter governing the filing of returns.
(‘74 Code, § 93.20) (Ord. 384-A, passed 4-1-71; Am. Ord. 01-1348, passed 1-16-
01; Am. Ord. 05-1469, passed 12-21-05)
§ 39.036 RETURNS AND CONTENTS THEREOF.
   (A)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession,
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income, earned during the preceding year and subject to the tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the
Finance Director may require, including a statement that the figures used in
the return are the figures used for federal income tax, adjusted to set forth
only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request with the municipal tax division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
municipal income tax return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. The extended due date
of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day of the month following
the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been
extended.
      (2)   The Finance Director may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         (a)   Fails to timely file the request;
         (b)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         (c)   Owes the municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         (d)   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by §
39.006. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of this chapter have been met. Any extension by
the Finance Director shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.

§ 39.037 GENERIC FORMS.
   The city shall accept a generic form of any return, report, or document
required to be filed if the generic form, once completed and filed, contains
all of the information required to be submitted with the city’s prescribed
returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return preparer filing
the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or ordinances of the
municipality governing the filing of returns, reports or documents.

§ 39.038 PAYMENT WITH RETURNS.
   (A)   The taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing thereof
pay to the Finance Director the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; however,
where tax has been withheld at the source, pursuant to the provisions of §
39.055; or where any portion of said tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer,
pursuant to the provisions of §
39.070; or where an income tax, creditable against the city tax pursuant to §
39.040 has been paid to another municipality, credit for the amount so paid
shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due, and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return. All tax
returns and payments of taxes due shall be received by the Tax Department no
later than the date due.
   (B)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment or part thereof shall be
refunded provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall be
collected or refunded. No refunds shall be made of amounts less than $10 except
in the case of an individual or business taxpayer who is filing a final return
as a result of moving out of the city or terminating business activities within
the city.
   (C)   Any taxpayer who issues a check or other negotiable instrument in
payment of an obligation under this chapter, which is later dishonored by the
payor-taxpayer’s financial institution for any reason, may be required to pay a
processing fee of $25 in addition to the interest and penalties provided for
late payment of taxes hereunder. This processing fee is not the city’s
exclusive remedy and does not preclude the city from pursuing prosecution of
the taxpayer under the appropriate, then-current provisions of state statutes.

overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in §§
39.040 and
39.041. Amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Finance Director .
   (B)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer’s city tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended city return, showing income subject to the tax based on
such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax
shown thereon, or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (C)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten days after
notification by the Finance Director, or his authorized representative, to file
the items required by this section.

§ 39.040 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY; CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS
THEREOF.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality and who
receives salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation or net profits
from sales made, work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the
municipality, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax
on such income, taxable under this chapter, to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter in the amount of the
tax so paid by him or in his behalf to such other municipality, not to exceed
1.6%.
(‘ 74 Code, § 93.70)
   (B)   Notwithstanding the provisions contained in §
39.040, or any other provisions inconsistent herewith, a claim for a refund or
credit under this section shall be made in such a manner as the Finance
Director may by regulation provide. No such claim for refund or credit shall be
allowed unless made on or before the date of filing the taxpayer’s final
return, unless such taxpayer’s employer files with the Finance Director a list
showing the tax withheld from such taxpayer’s wages, salaries, or commissions
for other municipalities.

§ 39.041 TIME LIMITATION ON SUITS, REFUNDS.
   (A)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. No additional assessment shall be made after three years from the
time of payment of any tax due hereunder; provided there shall be no period of
limitation on an additional assessment in case of a return that omits gross
income in excess of 25% of that required to be reported, or in the case of
filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in the
case of a failure to file a return. In those cases in which the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute
of limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Finance Director shall be extended one year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability. (‘74 Code, § 83.75)
   (B)   Claims for refund of municipal income taxes must be brought within

COLLECTION AT SOURCE
§ 39.055 WITHHOLDING BY EMPLOYER.
   (A)   Each employer within, or doing business within, the municipality, who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other
compensation basis, shall deduct, when such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation is paid, allocated, or set aside, the tax at the rate provided in
§
39.020 on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such employee and
shall, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following such withholding,
make a return and payment.
   (B)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (C)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (D)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (E)   So long as taxes withheld by an employer for the municipality during
the measurement period, payments may be made quarterly on or before the
fifteenth day of the month following the end of each quarter, subject to the
approval of the Finance Director. The Finance Director may revoke the approval
of quarterly filing and payments whenever the Finance Director has reason to
believe that the conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were
judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the
municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in
such case, the employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.

§ 39.056 EMPLOYER CONSIDERED AS TRUSTEE.
   Each employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same, until
payment is made by such employer to the municipality, as a trustee for the
benefit of the municipality, and any such tax collected by such employer from
his employees shall, until the same is paid to the municipality, be deemed a
trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each employer shall be liable for the
payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such
tax, in fact, has been withheld.

§ 39.057 CORPORATE OFFICERS PERSONAL LIABILITY.
   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay
all such tax to the municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of §
39.006. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s,
manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.

withholdings remitted. Such return shall include information concerning each
employee from whom the municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address,
zip code and Social Security number of each such employee, the total amount of

also report such payments to the municipality when the services were performed
in the municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall

§ 39A.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSE OF TAX.
   (A)   To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,
maintenance, new equipment, extension and enlargement of municipal services and
facilities and capital improvements, the City of Mt. Healthy (the “City”)
hereby levies an annual municipal income tax on income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   (1)   The annual tax is levied at a rate of 2%. The tax is levied at a
uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving income in the
city. The tax is levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
39A.03 and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)   Effective January 1, 2015, tax at a rate of 1/2% was approved by
residents of the city voting in a general election to provide additional funds
for the Police Department operations. The revenue received for this portion of
the income tax will be accounted for in a separate fund on the city's books and
expenses of the Police Department will be allocated to these funds.
   (C)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by Ordinance No.
15-1759 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.
The tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with,
the provisions and limitations of R.C. Chapter 718.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of
the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
Ohio Revised Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term
used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not

§ 39A.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   The income tax levied by the City at a rate of 2% is levied on the Municipal
Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or earning and/or receiving
income in the city.
   (A)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the city, the income tax levied herein shall be on
all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (§
39A.02(C)(16)).
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to “Municipal
Taxable Income” as defined in §
39A.02(C)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in §
39A.02(C)(12).

            1.    NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation
plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
            2.    QUALIFYING LOSS means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.    QUALIFYING TAX RATE means:
               a.   The applicable tax rate for the taxable year for the which
the taxpayer paid income tax to the city with respect to any portion of the
total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
               b.   If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the qualifying tax rate is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the city each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            4.    REFUNDABLE CREDIT means the amount of the city income tax
that was paid on the non- distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   If, in addition to the city, a taxpayer has paid tax to other

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the city
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
            1.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
            2.   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Domicile.
      (1)   (a)   1.   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the city
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the city

preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the city
for all or part of the taxable year.

domiciled in the city for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:

            2.   The location at which the individual is registered to vote;

regarding the individual's residency;
            7.   The primary location at which the individual is employed;
            8.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
            9.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the
city. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one “contact period”
with the city if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of the city and while away overnight from that abode spends at
least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
city.
         (c)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

      (1)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the city, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the city during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
            2.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the city to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
39A.04(C);
            3.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the city
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
         (b)   1.   If the apportionment factors described in division (D)(1)
(a) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the city, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
city may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
               a.    Separate accounting;
               b.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
               c.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
               d.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
            2.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
39A.12(A).
            3.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (D)(1)(b)1. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §
39A.12(A).
            4.   Nothing in division (D)(1)(b) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(a)2. of this section, WAGES,

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
            3.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (D)(1)(c)1. or 2. of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
         (d)   For the purposes of division (D)(1)(a)3. of this section,
receipts from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to
a municipal corporation as follows:
            1.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property

rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the city's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the city or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the city. The city shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
         (f)   1.    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the city shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the city. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under §
39A.03 or division (B)(1)(d) or (f) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in §
39A.01(B)(1), of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall
deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the
employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays
the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the city the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the city in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the city in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (A)(2)(a)1. of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (A)(2)(a)1. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
            3.    Intentionally left blank.
         (b)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is
required to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal
taxes withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the city. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the city as the return
required of a nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the city income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
         (e)   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the city the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the city income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the city until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been

         (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the city income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
         (k)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

fixed location or worksite location, “principal place of work” means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent
the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(b)1.a. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (B)(1)(b)2. of
this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for “municipal
corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that division.

         (b)   1.   Subject to divisions (B)(1)(c), (e), (f) and (g) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the city income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the city if the employee performed such services in the city on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
               a.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
city.
               b.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the city. For the purposes of this division, PRESUMED
WORKSITE LOCATION means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
city at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been,  expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in
a calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
                  1.    The nature of the services are such that it will
require more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
                  2.    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
               c.   The employee is a resident of the city and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in §
39A.04.
               d.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
            2.   For the purposes of division (B)(1)(b)1. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
city only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the city than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
               a.    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
               b.    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
               c.    Traveling from any location to another location in order

               e.    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes
the employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's

         (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
         (d)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(d)2. of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
            2.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the city
under division (B)(1)(d)1. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
city for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the city.
         (e)   If an employer's fixed location is the city and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in § 39A.02, the employer shall
withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages for a
taxable year and remit that tax only to the city, regardless of the number of
days which the employee worked outside the corporate boundaries of the city.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
         (f)   Divisions (B)(1)(b)1. and (B)(1)(d) of this section shall not
apply to the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an
agreement regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the
requirements of § 39A.04.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   (1)   An annual city income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer and any taxpayer that is not an individual for each
taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax
is due thereon.
         (a)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under § 39A.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the city.
         (b)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the city income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the city, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the city, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

      (5)   The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
      (6)   (a)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form W-
2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form
1065, Form 1120, Form 1120-REIT, Form 1120F, or Form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
         (d)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the city to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §
5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the City of Mt. Healthy. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is $10 or less.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return of
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City of Mt. Healthy. No remittance
is required if the net amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the city's income tax
return. The extended due date of the city's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
            1.   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the city's income tax return.
            2.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's city income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the city
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
         (c)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the city's income tax
return. The extended due date of the city's income tax return shall be the same
as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
         (d)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the city, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
         (e)   To the extent that any provision in this division (A)(7)
conflicts with any provision in divisions (C)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (C)(1), (2), (3), or (4) prevail.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the city shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the city for a taxable
year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the city an
annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) of this section.
      (9)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under §
39A.04(B)(1)(a) or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the city by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in §
39A.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the city, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the city and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the city to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by the city, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the city
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the city's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (B)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (C)   Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the city for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the city during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (C)(2)(a)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (C)(1) and (2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation
in accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under this
division (C)(3)(b)1. shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used
in this division, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(C)(3)(b)1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period.
Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the
extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(1)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (C)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (C)(2)(b) and (c) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (D)   Consolidated municipal income tax return.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

Internal Revenue Code.

(1)(a) of this section.
         (d)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
         (e)   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELEPHONE SERVICE has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the city's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five- year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (D)(2)(b) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (D)(2)(a) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (D)(2)(a) or (b) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the city income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the city. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated the
city income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated city income
tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated the city income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States department of

      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (D)(5)(b), (c), and
(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §

taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that division and
by substituting “an affiliated group of corporations” for “a C corporation's”
wherever “a C corporation's” appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated city income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
39A.02(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated the city income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (D)(1) through (8) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the city. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (D)(1) through (8) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the city. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (D)(1) through (8) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to the city;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the city income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated the city income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (D)(1) through (8) of this
section, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income attributable to”
for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated the city income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the city in accordance with this chapter
on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member
for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the city before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the city may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the city who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a non-
refundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other
municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such other municipality or the
rate of 1.6%
   (B)   The city shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the city who works in a joint economic development zone created under R.C. §
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under R.C. § 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on
income to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, “the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation” subject to

dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

§ 39A.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   ESTIMATED TAXES means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the city's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   TAX LIABILITY means the total taxes due to the city for the taxable
year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and after
applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from another
taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the city from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the city in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
39A.05(G) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the city, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
39A.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
39A.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the city under §
39A.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the city but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

§ 39A.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
$0.50 shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part of a
dollar that is less than $0.50 shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round
amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on
the document.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as in
§
39A.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is $10 or more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
39A.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, and the earliest
Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
39A.18(A)(4).
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the city, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the city as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the city is subject to recovery by the city. If the
city's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the city shall allow
a non-refundable credit against the tax or withholding the city claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the city's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the non- refundable credit shall be calculated using the
city's tax rate. However, if the city's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the non- refundable credit
is to be paid to the city, along with any penalty and interest that accrued
during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-forward.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the city changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
city. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
39A.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no refund need be
paid by the city. A request filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
39A.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the city's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended the city return showing income subject to the
city income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the city income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than $10.

§ 39A.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
39A.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
          (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
39A.09.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the city does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by § 39A.09, with interest on that amount as provided by §
39A.09(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover the city income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.13 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      LAST KNOWN ADDRESS means the address the Tax Administrator has at the
time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the Tax
Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a change
of address service offered by the Postal Service or an authorized delivery
service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS means an address to which the postal service or an
authorized  delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver an
assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery is
because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the Postal Service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other city official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         “This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date.”
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the city
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the city that arises pursuant to the city's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the city as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the city from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-1759, passed 11-3-15)
§ 39A.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the city ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.

the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the city or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter

the request was directed pursuant to §
39A.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
39A.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §

         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
39A.99 for a violation of § 39A.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed
by the Tax Administrator by law.

received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

deny an application if it determines that the applicant is not eligible or if
the city is not financially able to assist the business.

years. Any request for renewal shall be made in writing to the City Manager at
least 90 days before the expiration period. Renewal shall be based on the
prerequisites in division (C), and if all conditions have been met, the City
Manager shall renew the linked deposit. All recipients of a linked deposit
shall comply with all city Building and Zoning Codes and the requirements of
the specific lender’s loan. Failure to do so may result in the withdrawal of
city funds from the linked deposit.

   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u- turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one- way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u- turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (E)   A steady red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

is controlled by traffic control signals shall do all of the following if the
signal facing the driver exhibits no colored lights or colored lighted arrows,
exhibits a combination of such lights or arrows that fails to clearly indicate
the assignment of right- of-way, or, if the vehicle is a bicycle or an electric
bicycle, the signals are otherwise malfunctioning due to the failure of a
vehicle detector to detect the presence of the bicycle or electric bicycle:
      (1)   Stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, stop before
entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, if none, stop
before entering the intersection;
      (2)   Yield the right- of-way to all vehicles in the intersection or

“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

commercial driver’s license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver’s
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b)2. or (A)(4)(b)3.
of this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was
expired for more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)
(7).

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by

and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of

regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.011, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if

      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
      “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
      (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
      If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of § 73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.

license or permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the
time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) is effective immediately from the
time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

   (B)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
   (C)   (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
      (3)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
   (D)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under division (A)(1) of this section upon application and payment of the
applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (A)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (E)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the vehicle
or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection
by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit.
No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
   (F)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
   (G)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
   (H)   (1)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to gross load limits.

section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
      (3)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

§ 74.44 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.
(R.C. § 4513.33) Penalty, see §
70.99

   (B)   Whoever violates the weight provisions of this section shall be fined
$80 for the first 2,000 pounds, or fraction thereof, of overload; for overloads
in excess of 2,000 pounds, but not in excess of 5,000 pounds, such person shall
be fined $100, and in addition thereto $1 per 100 pounds of overload; for
overloads in excess of 5,000 pounds but not in excess of 10,000 pounds, such
person shall be fined $130, and in addition thereto $2 per 100 pounds of
overload, or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or both. For all overloads in
excess of 10,000 pounds, such person shall be fined $160, and in addition
thereto $3 per 100 pounds of overload, or imprisoned not more than 30 days, or
both. Whoever violates the weight provisions of vehicle and load relating to
gross load limits shall be fined not less than $100. No penalty prescribed in
this division (B)(2) shall be imposed on any vehicle combination if the
overload on any one axle does not exceed 1,000 pounds, and if the immediately
preceding or following axle, excepting the front axle of the vehicle
combination, is underloaded by the same or greater amount. For purposes of this
division (B)(2), two axles on one vehicle less than eight feet apart shall be
considered as one axle.

   (C)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, § 90.28(D) and
divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and § 90.36 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and
the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and

this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a

specifies that § 90.28(D) and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the
dog were a dangerous dog and that § 90.36 applies with respect to the dog as if
it were a dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall order the

         (b)   The expiration date and identification number of the driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by the card
holder.
      (2)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall use
the information that is derived from a transaction scan or that is permitted to
be recorded and maintained under division (D)(1) of this section, except for
purposes of R.C. § 4301.611, or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (3)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall use
a transaction scan device for a purpose other than a purpose listed in
divisions (1) or (2) of the definition for “transaction scan” in this section.
      (4)   No permit holder or agent or employee of a permit holder shall sell
or otherwise disseminate the information derived from a transaction scan to any
third party, including but not limited to selling or otherwise disseminating

a seller or agent or employee of a seller may release that information pursuant
to a court order or as specifically authorized by R.C. § 4301.611, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, or another section of this code or
the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)   Nothing in this section or R.C. § 4301.611, or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance, relieves a permit holder or an agent or employee of a
permit holder of any responsibility to comply with any other applicable local,
state or federal laws or rules governing the sale of beer, intoxicating liquor,
or low-alcohol beverages.
   (F)   Whoever violates division (B)(2) or (D) of this section is guilty of
an illegal liquor transaction scan, and the court may impose upon the offender
a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation. The Clerk of the Court
shall pay each collected civil penalty to the County Treasurer for deposit into

(R.C. § 4301.61)
§ 94.29 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
   (A)   A permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder may not be
found guilty of a charge of a violation of this chapter or any rule of the
Liquor Control Commission in which the age of the purchaser of any beer,
intoxicating liquor, or low-alcohol beverage is an element of the alleged
violation, if the permit holder, agent, or employee raises and proves as an
affirmative defense that all of the following occurred:
      (1)   A card holder attempting to purchase any beer, intoxicating liquor,
or low-alcohol beverage presented a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
an identification card.
      (2)   A transaction scan of the driver’s or commercial driver’s license
or identification card that the card holder presented indicated that the
license or card was valid.
      (3)   The beer, intoxicating liquor, or low- alcohol beverage was sold to
the card holder in reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan.
   (B)   In determining whether a permit holder or an agent or employee of a
permit holder has proven the affirmative defense provided by division (A) of
this section, the Liquor Control Commission or the trier of fact in a court of
record shall consider any written policy that the permit holder has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of R.C. §§ 4301.22(A)(1)
or (2), 4301.63 to 4301.636, 4301.69, and 4301.691, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinances. For purposes of division (A)(3) of this section,
the Commission or trier of fact shall consider that reasonable reliance upon
the identification presented and the completed transaction scan may require a
permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder to exercise reasonable
diligence to determine, and that the use of a transaction scan device does not
excuse a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder from
exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
      (1)   Whether a person to whom the permit holder or agent or employee of
a permit holder sells any beer or intoxicating liquor is 21 years of age or
older or sells low-alcohol beverage is 18 years of age or older;
      (2)   Whether the description and picture appearing on the driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by a card holder
is that of the card holder.
   (C)   The affirmative defense provided by division (A) of this section is in
addition to the defense provided by R.C. § 4301.639, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   In any hearing before the Liquor Control Commission and in any
criminal action in which the affirmative defense provided by division (A) of
this section is raised, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar
who issued an identification card under R.C. §§ 4507.50 to 4507.52 shall be
permitted to submit certified copies of the records of that issuance in lieu of
the testimony of the personnel of or contractors with the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles in the hearing or action.
(R.C. § 4301.611)
§ 94.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty
has been provided is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

§ 95.05 COLLECTION OF COST OF ABATING DANGEROUS PROPERTY CONDITION; INJUNCTION;
REHABILITATION.
   (A)   Collection of costs of abating dangerous property conditions.
      (1)   As used in this division (A):
         ABATEMENT ACTIVITY. Means each instance of any of the following:
            1.    Removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures;
            2.   Making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions;
            3.    Abatement of any nuisance by the municipality or its agent
pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section.
         TOTAL COST. Means any costs incurred due to the use of employees,
materials, or equipment of the municipality or its agent pursuant to division
(A)(5) of this section, any costs arising out of contracts for labor,
materials, or equipment, and costs of service of notice or publication required
under this section.
      (2)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this
section may collect the total cost of abatement activities by any of the
methods prescribed in division (A)(2)(a), (A)(2)(b), or (A)(2)(c) of this
section.
         (a)   For each abatement activity in which costs are incurred, the
Clerk of the Legislative Authority of the municipality or its agent pursuant to
division (A)(5) of this section may certify the total costs of each abatement
activity, together with the parcel number or another proper description of the
lands on which the abatement activity occurred, the date the costs were
incurred for each abatement activity, and the name of the owner of record at
the time the costs were incurred for each abatement activity, to the County
Auditor who shall place the costs as a charge upon the tax list and duplicate.
The costs are a lien upon such lands from and after the date the costs were
incurred. The costs shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the
municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section, as
directed by the Clerk of the Legislative Authority in the certification of the
total costs or in an affidavit from the agent delivered to the County Auditor
or County Treasurer. The placement of the costs on the tax list and duplicate
relates back to, and is effective in priority, as of the date the costs were
incurred, provided that the municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)
(5) of this section certifies the total costs within one year from the date the
costs were incurred. If a lien placed on a parcel of land pursuant to this
division is extinguished as provided in division (A)(8) of this section, the
municipality may pursue the remedy available under division (A)(2)(b) of this
section to recoup the costs incurred with respect to that parcel from any
person that held title to the parcel at the time the costs were incurred.
         (b)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section may commence a civil action to recover the total costs from the
person that held title to the parcel at the time the costs were incurred.
         (c)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section may file a lien on a parcel of land for the total costs incurred
under this section with respect to the parcel by filing a written affidavit
with the County Recorder of the county in which the parcel is located that
states the parcel number, the total costs incurred with respect to the parcel,
and the date such costs were incurred. The municipality or its agent may pursue
a foreclosure action to enforce the lien in a court of competent jurisdiction
or, pursuant to R.C. §§ 323.65 to 323.79, with the Board of Revision. The
municipality or its agent may elect to acquire the parcel by indicating such an
election in the complaint for foreclosure or in an amended complaint. Upon the
entry of a decree of foreclosure, the County Sheriff shall advertise and offer
the property for sale on at least one occasion. The minimum bid with regard to
the sale of the foreclosed property shall equal the sum of the taxes,
penalties, interest, costs, and assessments due and payable on the property,
the total costs incurred by the municipality or its agent with respect to the
property, and any associated court costs and interest as authorized by law. An
owner of the property may redeem the property by paying the minimum bid within
ten days after the entry of the decree of foreclosure. If an owner fails to so
redeem the property, and if the parcel is not sold for want of a minimum bid,
the property shall be disposed of as follows:
            1.   If the municipality or its agent elects to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be transferred to the municipality or its agent as
if the property were transferred by all owners in title to the municipality or
its agent in lieu of foreclosure as provided in R.C. § 5722.10;
            2.   If the municipality or its agent does not elect to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be forfeited to the state or to a political
subdivision or school district as provided in R.C. Chapter 5723.
            3.   When the municipality or its agent acquires property as
provided in this division (A)(2)(c), the property shall not be subject to
foreclosure or forfeiture under R.C. § 323.25 or R.C. Chapter 5721 or 5723, and
any lien on the property for costs incurred under this division (A) or for any
unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, charges, or assessments shall be
extinguished.
      (3)   This division (A) applies to any action taken by the municipality
or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section pursuant to R.C. §
715.26 or pursuant to Section 3 of Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.
      (4)   (a)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section shall not certify to the County Auditor for placement upon the tax
list and duplicate and the County Auditor shall not place upon the tax list and
duplicate as a charge against the land the costs of any abatement activity
undertaken under division (A)(2) of this section if any of the following apply:
            1.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been
transferred or sold to an electing subdivision as defined in R.C. § 5722.01,
regardless of whether the electing subdivision is still the owner of the land,
and the abatement activity occurred on a date prior to the transfer or
confirmation of sale to the electing subdivision.
            2.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been sold to
a purchaser at sheriff’s sale or auditor’s sale, the abatement activity
occurred on a date prior to the confirmation of sale, and the purchaser is not
the owner of record of the land immediately prior to the judgment of
foreclosure nor any of the following:
               a.   A member of that owner’s immediate family;
               b.   A person with a power of attorney appointed by that owner
who subsequently transfers the land to the owner;
               c.   A sole proprietorship owned by that owner or a member of
that owner’s immediate family;
               d.   A partnership, trust, business trust, corporation, or
association of which the owner or a member of the owner’s immediate family owns
or controls directly or indirectly more than 50%.
            3.   The abatement activity is taken on land that has been
forfeited to this state for delinquent taxes, unless the owner of record
redeems the land.
         (b)   Upon valid written notice to the County Auditor by any owner
possessing an ownership interest of record of the land or by an electing
subdivision previously in the chain of title of the land that the costs of an
abatement activity undertaken under division (A)(2) of this section was
certified for placement or placed upon the tax list and duplicate as a charge
against the land in violation of this division, the County Auditor shall
promptly remove such charge from the tax duplicate. This written notice to the
County Auditor shall include all of the following:
            1.   The parcel number of the land;
            2.   The common address of the land;
            3.   The date of the recording of the transfer of the land to the
owner or electing subdivision;
            4.   The charge allegedly placed in violation of this division.
      (5)   The municipality may enter into an agreement with a County Land
Reutilization Corporation organized under R.C. Chapter 1724 wherein the County
Land Reutilization Corporation agrees to act as the agent of the municipality
in connection with removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures, making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions, or
abating any nuisance, including high weeds, overgrown brush, and trash and
debris from vacant lots. The total costs of such actions may be collected by
the corporation pursuant to division (A)(2) of this section, and shall be paid
to the corporation if it paid or incurred such costs and has not been
reimbursed by the owner of record at the time of the action or any other party
with a recorded interest in the land.
      (6)   In the case of the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation
that is the agent of the municipality, a notation shall be placed on the tax
list and duplicate showing the amount of the lien ascribed specifically to the
agent’s total costs. The agent has standing to pursue a separate cause of
action for money damages to satisfy the lien or pursue a foreclosure action in
a court of competent jurisdiction or with the Board of Revision to enforce the
lien without regard to occupancy. For purposes of a foreclosure proceeding by
the County Treasurer for delinquent taxes, this division does not affect the
lien priority as between a County Land Reutilization Corporation and the County
Treasurer, but the corporation’s lien is superior to the lien of any other
lienholder of the property. As to a direct action by a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien for the taxes, assessment, charges, costs,
penalties, and interest on the tax list and duplicate is in all cases superior
to the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation, whose lien for total
costs shall be next in priority as against all other interests, except as
provided in division (A)(7) of this section.
      (7)   A County Land Reutilization Corporation acting as an agent of the
municipality under an agreement under this division (A) may, with the County
Treasurer’s consent, petition the court or Board of Revision with jurisdiction
over an action undertaken under division (A)(6) of this section pleading that
the lien of the corporation, as agent, for the total costs shall be superior to
the lien for the taxes, assessments, charges, costs, penalties, and interest.
If the court or Board of Revision determines that the lien is for total costs
paid or incurred by the corporation as such an agent, and that subordinating
the lien for such taxes and other impositions to the lien of the corporation
promotes the expeditious abatement of public nuisances, the court or board may
order the lien for the taxes and other impositions to be subordinate to the
corporation’s lien. The court or board may not subordinate the lien for taxes
and other such impositions to any other liens.
      (8)   (a)   When a parcel of land upon which a lien has been placed under
division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(c) of this section is transferred to a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien on the parcel shall be extinguished if the
lien is for costs or charges that were incurred before the date of the transfer
to the corporation and if the corporation did not incur the costs or charges,
regardless of whether the lien was attached or the costs or charges were
certified before the date of transfer. In such a case, the County Land
Reutilization Corporation and its successors in title shall take title to the
property free and clear of any such lien and shall be immune from liability in
any action to collect such costs or charges.
         (b)   If a County Land Reutilization Corporation takes title to
property before any costs or charges have been certified or any lien has been
placed with respect to the property under division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(c) of
this section, the corporation shall be deemed a bona fide purchaser for value
without knowledge of such costs or lien, regardless of whether the corporation
had actual or constructive knowledge of the costs or lien, and any such lien
shall be void and unenforceable against the corporation and its successors in
title.
      (9)   The municipality or County Land Reutilization Corporation may file
an affidavit with the County Recorder under R.C. § 5301.252 stating the nature
and extent of any proceedings undertaken under this division (A). Such an
affidavit may include a legal description of a parcel or, in lieu thereof, the
common address of the parcel and the permanent parcel number to which such
address applies.
(R.C. § 715.261)
   (B)   Injunction may be granted for failure to comply. No person shall
erect, alter, repair or maintain any residential building, office, mercantile
building, workshop or factory, including a public or private garage, or other
structure, within the municipality unless all ordinances or resolutions enacted
pursuant to R.C. §§ 715.26 through 715.30 are fully complied with. In the event
any building or structure is being erected, constructed, altered, repaired or
maintained in violation of such ordinances or resolutions, or there is imminent
threat of violation, the municipality or the owner of any contiguous or
neighboring property who would be especially damaged by such violation, in
addition to any other remedies provided by law, may institute a suit for
injunction to prevent or terminate such violation. (R.C. § 715.30)
   (C)   Appropriation of property to rehabilitate; demolition or sale.
      (1)   In order to rehabilitate a building or structure that the
municipality has determined to be a blighted property as defined in R.C. §
1.08, the municipality may appropriate, in the manner provided by R.C. §§
163.01 through 163.22, any such building or structure and the real property of
which it is a part. The municipality shall rehabilitate the building or
structure or cause it to be rehabilitated within two years after the
appropriation so that the building or structure is no longer a public nuisance,
insecure,
unsafe, structurally defective, unhealthful or unsanitary, or a threat to the
public health, safety, or welfare, in violation of a building code or ordinance
adopted under R.C. § 731.231. Any building or structure appropriated pursuant
to this division which is not rehabilitated within two years shall be
demolished.
      (2)   If, during the rehabilitation process, the municipality retains
title to the building or structure and the real property of which it is a part,
then within 180 days after the rehabilitation is complete, the municipality
shall appraise the rehabilitated building or structure and the real property of

§ 98.01 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle

property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been

oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (C)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (A)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         (a)   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle
was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for vehicle
removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         (b)   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(D)(1)(b) of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (A)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         (a)   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         (b)   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (A)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (H)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in

of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the

division (H) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that
complies with all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow- away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

established as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (H)(1) of
this section, without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the
private property may cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The

as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   (a)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing

request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
         (c)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves
the vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the
vehicle shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the
motor vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action
under R.C. § 4513.611.
         (d)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced
by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (H)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal

§ 98.02 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY; NOTICE; DISPOSITION.
   (A)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,

upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         (a)   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         (b)   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (C) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (B)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (A) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (C)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (D)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (E)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (F)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
§ 98.03 DISPOSITION OF VEHICLE ORDERED INTO STORAGE.

division (A)(2), (3) and (5) of this section which has remained unclaimed by
the owner or lienholder for a period of ten days or longer following
notification as provided in §
98.02 may be disposed of as provided in this section.
(R.C. § 4513.63)
§ 98.05 ABANDONMENT OF JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE PROHIBITED.
   (A)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle
as defined in §
98.04 on private property for more than 72 hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, or on a public
street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or highway for 48 hours
or longer without notification to the chief of a law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such
place.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the fact that a motor vehicle has
been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in §§
98.01,
98.02 and
98.04 and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61 and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the

prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on streets, highways, public
property, or private property within the municipality.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the municipality from the disposal of the vehicle.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
§ 98.06 JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE; ORDER TO COVER OR REMOVE; NOTICE; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   For purposes of this section, JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of §
98.04(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5) that is left uncovered in the open on private
property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the
right to possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk
yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of R.C. §§
4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a political
subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor
vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
      (2)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, and
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk

motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

city other than that to be occupied by the activity and other areas contiguous
thereto;

at assembly points of the proposed activity will unduly interfere with proper

move from its point of origin to its point of termination, expeditiously and

private monetary gain or commercial advertisement; or
         (k)   The parade will fail to comply in any respect with the
provisions of this chapter or any other applicable law.

      (1)   The City Manager or Chief of Police may issue a special event
permit after evaluating the application, such other information as may
otherwise be obtained, and the considerations in division (A) of this section.

the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates with the city, the
proposed rates will continue in effect.
      (3)   Such public hearing may be held in conjunction with other ICRC
communities under the direction of the ICRC.
   (D)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the City Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the City
Council shall, within 60 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic
cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   90 days if the City Council needs more time to ensure that a
rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         (b)   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark.
      (2)   If the City Council has not made a decision within the 90 or 150
day period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the City Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector's name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the City Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the
benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.
Based on the City Council or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic cable rates
shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992 and
the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic
cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The City Council will
review a cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve initial basic
cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the
benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates less 10%, will
prescribe the cable operator's new rates.
   (I)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the city or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the City Council shall adopt
its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the
following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the City Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the City Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If the City Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
City Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with division (G) or (H)
above, as applicable. In addition, the City Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a
newspaper of general circulation.
   (J)   Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.
('74 Code, § 94.02) (Ord. 94-1084, passed 1-4-94)
§ 111.03 REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (A)   Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the
cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the City Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
price cap, the City Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city.
      (2)   If the City Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the City Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether
the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the
material before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing,
the City Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   90 days if the City Council or the ICRC needs more time to
ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
as determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   150 days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the City Council has not made a decision within the 90 to 150
day period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
   (D)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the City Council or the ICRC shall hold
at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.
   (E)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector's name
and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the City Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the City Council later issued a decision disapproving any
portion of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the City Council
shall review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City Council's findings, the
basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the City Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the City Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the
cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   (I)   Decision. The City Council's decision concerning the requested rate
increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision.
   (J)   Refunds.
      (1)   The City Council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments
with interest if:
         (a)   The City Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in division (C) above; and
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The City Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the City Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
   (K)   Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.

shall the portion of the definition of the term PERSON that is set forth in
division (1)(a)2. of this definition be applied or construed in any section
contained in Title XIII of this code that sets forth a criminal offense in any
of the following manners:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (2)(a) of this
definition, in a manner so that the offense prohibits or is construed as
prohibiting any pregnant woman or her physician from performing an abortion
with the consent of the pregnant woman, with the consent of the pregnant woman
implied by law in a medical emergency, or with the approval of one otherwise
authorized by law to consent to medical treatment on behalf of the pregnant
woman. An abortion that violates the conditions described in the immediately

of the type otherwise adequate to permit medical treatment to the pregnant
woman, even if it does not comply with R.C. § 2919.12.

applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:

sections listed in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal

the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Chapter 3734
§ 130.12 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person’s use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution’s burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149.
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio river extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio river with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio river and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio river under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELECOMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

located in any of those counties, the juvenile court may specify a services
provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If the Board of County Commissioners recognizes a citizens’
reward program under R.C. § 9.92, the Board shall notify the Police Department

county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same

2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under § 130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for
prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is
necessary to deter the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. §§ 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving
the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self- defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.21 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 to 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond
was written;
         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
(R.C. § 2927.27) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21))
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in § 130.18 or 133.99 of this code or R.C. §
2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this section and unless another term
is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may
 
2023 S-17
   General Provisions   23
impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 a reimbursement
sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term is to be
served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§ 307.93, 341.14,
341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and R.C. §
2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a specification of the type described in
R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more of those violations, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 120 days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court
2023 S-17
24   Mt. Healthy - General Offenses
retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail term. Upon motion of either
party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in the court’s sole discretion
and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute one or more community control
sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this section for any jail days that are
not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§ 130.18 and 133.99 of this Code or
R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the
duration of the community control sanctions imposed and shall notify the
offender that if any of the conditions of the community control sanctions are
violated the court may do any of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the
2023 S-17
   General Provisions   25
jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting to the court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If the offender
resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has been
established to serve the municipal court or county court in that jurisdiction,
the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the county court to
receive the offender into the general control and supervision of that
department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing court a
violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The sentencing
court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for the duration
of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community
 
2023 S-17
26   Mt. Healthy - General Offenses
control sanction. Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction
does not relieve the offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G)
of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the
offender’s occupation or care for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in

municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender
2017 S-14
28   Mt. Healthy - General Offenses
demonstrates a change in circumstances from the date the court imposes the
sentence or that the modification would otherwise be in the interests of
justice. If the court grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable
contribution to the court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that
contribution into the general fund of the county, municipality, or other local
entity that provides funding to the court. If more than one entity provides
funding to the court, the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable
contribution equal to the percentage of funding the entity provides to the
court in that entity’s general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this
division (G) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as
required by this division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the
financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include,
but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
2023 S-17
   General Provisions   29
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:

            1.    Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the

immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.   
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial
2023 S-17
30   Mt. Healthy - General Offenses
sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing and may impose a
term of community service under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of
imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court does not determine
that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term of community service
under division (F)(1) of this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a
financial sanction under this division (G) and in addition to imposing court
costs. The court may order community service for a minor misdemeanor pursuant
to division (F)(4) of this section in lieu of or in addition to imposing a
financial sanction under this section and in addition to imposing court costs.
If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court costs, the court may
order community service in lieu of the financial sanction or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender

pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.A. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.B.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential

division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment

described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be

under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.

collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:

installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that
the court considers just, except that the maximum time permitted for payment
shall not exceed five years. If the court is a county court or a municipal
court operated by a county, the acceptance of payments by any financial
transaction device shall be governed by the policy adopted by the board of
county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. § 301.28. If the court is a
municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk may pay any fee associated
with processing an electronic transfer out of public money or may charge the
fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender’s payment history available to the victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.

         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.

2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §§ 2913.31 or 2913.43
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61
(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried

of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. §§ 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C.
§§ 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same

value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))

resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where the
minor resides and the adult owner or resident of that property has given
permission for the minor to be there;
      (5)   In case of reasonable necessity for the minor remaining in a public
place but only after the minor's parent has communicated to the Chief of Police
or the person designated by the Chief of Police to receive such notifications
the facts establishing the reasonable necessity relating to a specified public
place at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin
and destination. If the reasonable necessity arises out of a special event, it
shall be sufficient if the sponsor of the special event, rather than the parent
of each attending minor, makes such communication to the Chief of Police. A
copy of the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by
the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it
was received and of the names and addresses of the parent and minor or of the

   It shall be unlawful for a parent of a minor knowingly to permit or by
inefficient control to allow the minor to remain in any city public place under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this subchapter. The term “knowingly” includes knowledge that a parent
should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in
that parent's legal custody. This requirement is intended to hold a neglectful
or careless parent up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, therefore, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.

him or her from attending school at that particular time, or unless the minor
is accompanied by a parent, or a responsible adult selected by the parent to
supervise the minor.
   (B)   Each parent of a minor between the ages of six and 16, inclusive,
shall have a duty to prohibit the minor from behaving contrary to division (A)
of this section.
   (C)   It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section that
the minor, at the time he or she was found at a place other than in school, was
not required by law to be in attendance at school.
('74 Code, § 132.39) (Ord. 95-1146, passed 5-16-95)
§ 132.30 MINORS SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL.
   (A)   If a minor between the ages of six and 16, inclusive, is suspended or
expelled from school, then each parent of the minor shall have the following
duties for the duration of the suspension or expulsion:
      (1)   The duty to personally supervise the minor, or to arrange for a
responsible adult to supervise the minor, at the times that the minor would
have been required to be in attendance at school had he or she not been
suspended or expelled; and
      (2)   The duty to prohibit the minor from being at any public place at
the times that the minor would have been required to be in attendance at school
had he or she not been suspended or expelled.
   (B)   No minor between the ages of six and 16, inclusive, that has been
suspended or expelled from school shall fail to comply with supervision
provided or arranged by a parent pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section.

   It shall be unlawful for any operator of any business establishment to
knowingly permit a minor to remain at the establishment under circumstances not
constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of this subchapter.
The term “knowingly” includes knowledge that an operator should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the patrons of the establishment. The standard for
“knowingly” shall be applied through an objective test: whether a reasonable
person in the operator's position should have known that the patron was a minor
in violation of the subchapter.
('74 Code, § 132.41) (Ord. 95-1146, passed 5-16-95)

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

Identification and Investigation or a laboratory operated by another law
enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority of an

providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed by the
person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the basis of
the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as
to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it contains any
amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of unit
dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or the
existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2925.041 or a violation of this chapter,
R.C. Chapter 2925 or R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the possession of
chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation, or substance
included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report from the Bureau
or from any laboratory that is operated or established as described in this
division that is signed by the person performing the analysis, stating that the
substances that are the basis of the alleged offense have been weighed and
analyzed and stating the findings as to the content, weight, and identity of
each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and
weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the
evidence was handled in accordance with established and accepted procedures

   (B)   The prosecuting attorney shall serve a copy of the report on the
attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (C)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney's receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.
   (F)   In addition to the rights provided under division (E) of this section,
any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or R.C. Chapters 2925
or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any multiple
thereof, or who is accused of a violation of R.C. § 2925.11 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor violation, that
involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice, or, if the
accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the court,
present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis of the
alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further written
request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the
measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at
conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number of
unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

convicted of or pleads guilty to a drug abuse offense may order the offender to
pay to the state, municipal, or county law enforcement agencies that handled
the investigation and prosecution all of the costs that the state, municipal
corporation, or county reasonably incurred in having tests performed under this
section or R.C. § 2925.51 or in any other manner on any substance that was the
basis of, or involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance
contained any amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests
indicate that the substance tested contained any controlled substance. No court
shall order an offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed
on a substance if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance
tested contained any controlled substance. The court shall hold a hearing to
determine the amount of costs to be imposed under this section. The court may
hold the hearing as part of the sentencing hearing for the offender.

accordance with the provisions of this Building Code, he shall refuse to issue
a permit until such application, drawings, specifications, details, and

of materials is essential for conformity to this Building Code, specific
information shall be given to establish such quality; and in no case shall this
Building Code be cited or the term “legal”, or its equivalent, be used as a
substitute for specific information. The Chief Building Official may waive the
requirement for filing drawings when the work involved is of a minor nature.
(‘74 Code, § 150.20)
   (B)   Requirements.  The drawings to be filed for buildings, structures, and

during the process of the execution of the work or prior thereto, it is desired
to deviate in any manner affecting the construction of other essential or vital
feature of the work from the terms of the application, drawings,
specifications, or statement, notice of such intention, to alter or deviate,
shall be given in writing to the Chief Building Official and his written
consent shall be obtained before such alteration or deviation may be made. If
such change or deviation affects the bearing or structural parts of such work
or its class of occupancy, new plans and specifications therefor shall be
submitted for approval. Notices of alterations and approvals thereof shall be
filed with the original application for permit.
   (D)   Plot plan and/or location plan.
      (1)   The plot plan shall consist of a plan of the lot site upon which it
is intended to build, erect, alter or add to such building or structure, which
plan shall be a property survey bearing the seal of an individual authorized by
law to make such surveys in the state and shall show the location and
dimensions of such lot.
      (2)   The location plan shall show the location of all easements and
rights-of-way on such lot and/or all facilities installed thereon; the widths
of the streets, alleys, or courtways upon which the lot or site abuts; the
sidewalk and curb lines thereof; fire hydrant, the amount of space on such
street or alley that will be used when such space is desired for the storage of
building materials and rubbish; the location of any building or structure on
the lot; the plan of the first story in heavy lines and all projections in
their extremes in broken lines; the dimensions of the body of the building, its
extreme projections and the distance thereof from the adjoining street or lot
lines and the distance between the building or structure and any other building
or structure on the same lot or site. The plot plan may be combined with the
location plan, and such plans shall be drawn to a uniform scale, and the scale
and compass points shall be legibly marked on the plan. Where the plot plan
indicates a conflict with an easement, right-of-way, or facility of a public
utility or public authority, the Chief Building Official shall notify the
utility or authority concerned and allow seven days interval before issuing a
permit to allow the utility or authority to contest the applicant’s right to
build as proposed.
      (3)   If existing streets, alleys, sidewalks, public right-of-ways, and/
or public properties are required for use as storage areas, and/or construction
areas, for work approved under a permit issued, it shall be necessary for the
applicant to request, in writing, for the use of the public areas, as
stipulated above, and to include, but not limit his request to his intent,
extent and time span for said use. If approved by the Chief Building Official,
or his authorized representative, it shall be understood herein that said
applicant shall be liable for any and all makes or manner of activities, within
the public area, he has requested to use, as per the time of use stipulated.
      (4)   For the purpose of this section the record plan for a subdivision
or plat may be used as the required plot plan, provided that it bears the
required seal and provided further that the outlines of the building or
structure are shown on the appropriate lot with dimensions to show its exact
location with respect to the lot lines.
   (E)   Grading information. This Building Code shall require grading
information determining existing and proposed grades of the floors of buildings
and outside earth placement in relation to public streets, sewers, storm
drainage lines, and adjoining properties.
   (F)   Specifications of materials to be used. Each set of drawings submitted

Chief Building Official determines that the proposed project is of a simple
nature and such information shall not be required.
(‘74 Code, § 150.22)
§ 150.039 EMERGENCIES.
   In case of emergency where there is actual and immediate risk of failure or
collapse of a building or structure or the existence of defective equipment or
service facilities such as to endanger life or health or such other condition
as to require immediate action to make repairs necessary to prevent the
occurrence of such failure or collapse or the occurrence of such danger and
time available is not sufficient to allow the securing of a permit from the
Chief Building Official as required by this Building Code, the person, firm or
corporation required to perform such repairs may proceed to do so after having
first notified the Chief Building Official of such fact without obtaining a
permit as required by this Building Code. In case the Chief Building Official
is unavailable, notice shall be given to the Backup Chief Building Official.
(‘74 Code, § 150.24)
§ 150.040 FAILURE TO OBTAIN PERMIT BEFORE STARTING WORK.
   Any person who shall commence any installation or work for which a permit is
required by this Building Code, without first having obtained a permit therefor
shall, if legally authorized and subsequently allowed to obtain a permit, pay
double the permit fees prescribed, however this requirement shall not apply to
emergency work or installations as provided by §
150.039 when it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Chief Building
Official that such work or installation was urgently necessary and that it
would have been impractical to have waited the normal time consumed in
application for and issuance of the permit. Nevertheless, even in such
emergencies the required permit shall be obtained without unreasonable delay
after installation starts, and in no case more than three days in which the
office of the Chief Building Official is open for business, or the extra fee as
herein provided shall be charged for the permit. Before issuing such permit,
the Chief Building Official shall take necessary steps to determine whether
work performed prior to the date of permit and inspection conform to this
Building Code. Such steps may include but shall not be limited to directing the
tearing out of sections of surface work for access to subsurface sections,
digging for access to foundations, piping and other subterranean work and the
like. The applicant for the permit shall perform all such work as may be
directed at his own expense.
(‘74 Code, § 150.25)
§ 150.041 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   (A)   The Chief Building Official shall examine or cause to be examined all
applications for permits, and amendments thereto, within a reasonable time
after filing. If the application or the drawings do not conform to the
requirements of all pertinent laws, he shall reject such application stating
the reasons therefor. If he is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the
requirements of this Building Code and all laws and ordinances applicable
thereto, he shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.
(‘74 Code, § 150.26)
   (B)   The Chief Building Official shall attach his signature to every
permit, or he may authorize a subordinant to affix such signature thereto.
(‘74 Code, § 150.29)
§ 150.042 TIME LIMITATION OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Permit time limit. Each permit shall have stated on its face the
period of time for which it is valid. Notwithstanding such statement, an
application for a permit for any proposed work shall be deemed to have been
abandoned six months after date of filing, unless such application has been
diligently prosecuted or a permit shall have been issued; except that for
reasonable cause, the Chief Building Official may grant not more than two

   Nothing in this Building Code shall require changes in the drawings,
construction, or designated use of a building for which a lawful permit has
been issued or otherwise lawfully authorized before the effective date of this
Building Code, provided that work under such permit or authorization is under
active prosecution upon such date, or is actively prosecuted within 90 days
after such date, and that all work thereunder is completed, as so authorized,
within one year after the date thereof or within an authorized extension of
time; provided however, that if the work has been diligently prosecuted, an
extension of time shall be granted for the completion of such work which shall
permit its completion in accordance with the original permit.
(‘74 Code, § 150.28)
§ 150.044 APPROVED PAPERS TO BECOME RECORDS OF THE CHIEF BUILDING OFFICIAL.
   All approved drawings, specifications, and other papers filed with the
application for permit shall be so stamped or endorsed by the Chief Building
Official and one set shall be returned to the applicant for a permit, and the
certified copies of the same shall be kept on the building or work until the
same has been completed. True copies of all or as many of the said drawings,
specifications, and statements as may be required in the opinion of the Chief

§ 150.045 APPROVAL IN PART.
   The Chief Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of
foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the entire
drawings and specifications for the whole building have been submitted,

he is required to delay initiation of said work until completion and approval
of the drawings and specifications together with such other data as may be
necessary to demonstrate that the work will comply with all the pertinent
requirements of this Building Code. The holder of such permit for the

with the work but shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, or
set aside any of the provisions of this Building Code, zoning laws or other
applicable laws except as specifically allowed by lawfully granted modification
or deviation.

amending the application to that effect, except where the change is caused by
reason of an official street opening, street widening or other public
improvement.
   (F)   Lot lines. It shall be illegal to sell, lease or provide an easement
over any land at any time if by virtue of such sale, lease or easement any
clearance, yard or court space prescribed by this Building Code or the zoning
or other applicable laws for fire clearance or for other legal purposes is
reduced to such extent as to constitute a violation of this Building Code or
such other laws, and such sale, lease or easement shall be deemed null and void
until adequate provisions are made to bring the property into conformance with
this Building Code or the applicable law.
(‘74 Code, § 150.35)
§ 150.047 POSTING OF PERMIT.
   A true copy of the building permit or such other instrument serving the

issuance of the permit or approval was based.
      (3)   Whenever any false statement or misrepresentation has been made
upon the application, drawings, or specifications on which the issuance of the
permit or approval was based. The adjudication order shall be issued under the

   (B)   The revocation notice of the permit in every instance shall be in
writing and shall be served upon the holder of the permit, the owner, his
agent, or the person having charge of the work. Any revocation notice shall
also be posted upon the building or structure in question by the Chief Building
Official. After the notice is received or posted, it shall be unlawful for any
person to proceed with any operation for which such permit was issued. No part
of the fees for such permit shall be returned. Revocation of a permit shall be
subject to appeal to the Board of Appeals as defined in §

repair, removal, demolition, or change of use of any building, structure, or
site, the Chief Building Official may examine or cause to be examined any or
all such buildings, structures and sites in connection with which an
application has been filed for such a permit. He shall conduct or cause to be
conducted such inspections from time to time during, and upon completion of,
the work for which he issues such permits as he may deem necessary to determine
that the work is in accordance with the requirements of this Building Code and
the approved drawings and specifications; and he shall maintain a record of all
such examinations and inspections and of all violations of this Building Code.
(‘74 Code, § 150.36)
§ 150.061 NOTICE THAT WORK READY FOR INSPECTION; REQUIRED INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   Notification by permit holder. It shall be the responsibility of the
holder of a permit to notify the Chief Building Official when work is ready for
the various inspections required by the terms of the permit or the approved
rules. Such notice shall be given within a reasonable time within which such
inspection is desired but in no event shall be less than 24 hours. Notice given
on a Friday or on a day prior to a legal holiday shall not constitute notice
for inspection on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. Before giving such notice, the
holder of the permit shall first test the work and satisfy himself that it
conforms to the approved plans and specifications and the requirements of this
Building Code.
   (B)   Required inspections.  
      (1)   After the excavation has been completed and before any footings

   Upon receipt of notice that work is ready for inspection the Chief Building
Official shall inspect, or cause such work to be inspected, as soon as
reasonably practicable; however, failure of the Chief Building Official to make
a prompt inspection shall not be deemed justification for covering work without
inspection when such work is required under the terms of the permit to be
inspected before being covered.
(‘74 Code, § 150.38)
§ 150.063 COVERING WORK.
   It shall be a violation of this Building Code to cover prior to inspection
any work required to be inspected under the provisions of a permit, the
approved rules, or this Building Code, irrespective of any penalties for such
violation. The Chief Building Official may require the holder of the permit to
uncover any such work for inspection and the cost of uncovering such work and
of replacing the cover after the work has been found satisfactory shall be
borne by the holder of the permit.
(‘74 Code, § 150.39)
§ 150.064 INSPECTION BY OTHERS.
   The Chief Building Official, at his discretion, may accept, in lieu of
inspection by himself or his inspectors, a certificate or report of inspection
for any part or parts of the work made by any architect, engineer, board or
bureau recognized by him as an authority in such part or parts of the work,
providing such certificate or report shall show that the said part or parts of
the work conform to the requirements of this Building Code and all other laws
and ordinances relating to the same subject matter.
(‘74 Code, § 150.40)
§ 150.065 PLANT INSPECTION.

point of the manufacture or fabrication, all materials and assemblies which
this Building Code, or rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, requires
to be inspected at such points. Plant inspection will not be requested:
   (A)   Where materials, assemblies, service equipment, and accessories are
accessible for inspection at the job site.
   (B)   Where licensed professional engineers, architects (registered in
Ohio), or others as approved, inspect and furnish a report of inspection to the
Chief Building Official that the material, assembly, service equipment, and
accessories are in compliance with this Building Code.
   (C)    Where materials, assemblies, service equipment and accessories are
designed and manufactured under the supervision of the licensed professional
engineer or architect (registered in Ohio) and are in conformance with this
Building Code, the licensed professional engineer or architect shall furnish in
writing a certification that the assembly in question has been inspected and
meets all the requirements of this Building Code if so requested by the Chief
Building Official.
(‘74 Code, § 150.41)
§ 150.066 INSPECTION OF PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS.
   (A)   The Board of Health of the Hamilton County Health District will make
inspections of the installation, construction, alterations or additions to, or

work shall be used until inspected and approved.
(‘74 Code, § 150.42)
   (B)   The Inspection Bureau, Inc., will make inspections of the
installation, construction, alterations to and additions to, or the repair of

product indicating that the factory inspection has been made shall be accepted
in lieu of any written report required above.
(‘74 Code, § 150.44)
§ 150.068 FINAL INSPECTION AND OCCUPANCY.
   It shall be the duty of the Chief Building Official to make, or cause to be
made, a final inspection and examination of all buildings or structures
included under the various classifications of this Building Code, hereafter
erected, constructed, altered, repaired or added to, before any such building
or structure is occupied, and if such a building has been found to have been
constructed in conformity to the provisions of this Building Code, to issue a
written certificate thereof to the owner as set forth below.
   (A)   Certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be obtained
by the owner or his agent before which time it shall be unlawful to occupy a
building. The owner or agent will be subject to penalties provided in this
Building Code if he allows the building to be occupied before final inspection
has been made and a certificate of occupancy has been issued. Temporary
occupancy may be authorized as provided hereunder.
   (B)   Compliance with other codes. A certificate of occupancy shall be
issued only when the owner or builder has complied with all provisions of this
Building Code, and any other regulations controlling all or any portion of work
requiring approval for safe and legal occupancy.
   (C)   Work in public right-of-way. Where work in the public right-of-way is
necessary to bring the improvements located therein up to the standards of the
city as established by the office of City Engineer, such work shall be
completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. This work shall
include sidewalks, curb and gutter, storm sewers and appurtenances, and street
paving. All work in the public right-of-way shall be done in conformance with
the specifications and standards established by the City Engineer and on file
in the office of City Engineer. The work required to be done in the public
right-of-way may be deferred for good reason such as when general street
improvements are acceptable to the City Engineer to assure the completion of
such work at a later date are provided.
   (D)   Cost of engineering services. Where engineering services are furnished
in connection with any improvement other than inspection and approval, the cost
of such services shall be paid to the city. Such cost shall be the City
Engineer’s estimate as based on published fees by the Ohio Society of
Professional Engineers.
   (E)   Temporary certificate of occupancy. The Chief Building Official may
issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a specific time when a building
or structure has been substantially completed so that its occupancy would not
be hazardous or detrimental to the general welfare, and when full compliance
with all applicable codes and permits has not been achieved, and when there are
valid reasons for allowing such occupancy on a temporary basis. Delay of
outside concrete work because of cold weather is an example of a valid reason.
Where a temporary certificate of occupancy is requested by an owner or his
agent, the Chief Building Official shall require that the owner, and other
interested party such as a tenant, sign a statement guaranteeing full
completion of all Building Code regulated items before expiration of the
specified time and an agreement to the cut-off of any or all utility services
without recourse from the date of expiration of the temporary certificate of
occupancy until all work is satisfactorily completed.
(‘74 Code, § 150.45)
   (F)   Change of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be required for
each building or structure whenever its use is changed from one occupancy class
to another, or for a part of a building or structure, where its use is changed.
Inspections shall be made in every case. The Chief Building Official shall
direct all interested agencies to make inspections within their several
jurisdictions and attest to full compliance before a certificate of occupancy
is issued. The owner shall be obligated to make application for all certificate
of occupancy inspections and pay all charges for same. The owner shall make his
premises comply to this Building Code before allowing this change of occupancy.

150.103.

constitute a fire hazard, or are or shall become in any way dangerous to human
life or the public welfare, or which, by reason of illegal or improper use,
occupancy, or maintenance, are or shall become unsafe, shall be taken down and
removed or shall be made safe and secure as the Chief Building Official shall
deem necessary, and as provided in this Building Code or any other applicable

order that particular repairs or improvements be made in order to render the
building or structure safe, secure, and sanitary, or that the building or
structure, or unsafe portion thereof, be demolished, within a specified period
not less than 30 days. The time specified may be extended by the Chief Building
Official for good cause shown. The unsafe building order shall state that if
there is not full compliance with the order within the time specified, or as
extended, the city will repair, alter, or demolish the building or structure,
as called for in the order, or institute legal proceedings to enforce
compliance with the order, unless the owner appeals the order as provided in §
150.084.

   (B)   If neither the owner, agent, or person in control of such unsafe
building or structure can be found within the county after reasonable diligent
search, the unsafe building order shall be sent to one of them by registered or

posted in a conspicuous place on such building or structure; and such procedure
shall be deemed the equivalent of personal notice or service.

   The Chief Building Official shall furnish a copy of all unsafe building
orders to the public utilities serving that building or structure which may be
affected by the condition responsible for said order, and shall mark thereon a
request that service being furnished the building or structure by said utility
be discontinued when in his opinion the continuance of said service will
constitute a hazard to the public. On receipt of said copy of notice and the
request thereof, any person, firm, association, and the like supplying such
service shall promptly discontinue its supply at the meter in the designated
portion of the building or structure. It shall be unlawful for such person,
firm, association, and the like thereafter to continue such service or to
restore that same until furnished with a copy of the certificate of approval
from the Chief Building Official certifying that an inspection has been made,
that the hazardous conditions have been corrected, and that the affected
service installation has been brought into substantial compliance with the
requirements of this Building Code.

§ 150.084 DISREGARD OF UNSAFE BUILDING ORDER; APPEALS.
   (A)   The owner of any building or structure with regard to which an unsafe
building order has been issued under this Building Code shall have the right to
appeal such order to the Board of Appeals. Such appeal shall be filed with the
Chief Building Official, in writing, within 20 days after service of the unsafe
building order. No appeal shall be heard unless it alleges that such order is
unnecessary, improper, or unreasonable, and states specific reasons in support
of the allegations. An appeal shall stay any action by the Chief Building
Official or the city to enforce the order. There shall be no stay of any
emergency action taken pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   On the owner’s or his agent’s failure or neglect to comply with, or on
his use of the unsafe building or structure in violation of, the unsafe
building order issued under §
150.082, the Chief Building Official may make any or all of the repairs or
improvements, or demolish the building or structure, or unsafe portion thereof,
as specified in the unsafe building order. The Chief Building Official may
advise the Director of Law to institute such proceedings as may be appropriate
to compel compliance.

§ 150.085 EMERGENCY MEASURES; VACATING.
   (A)   When, in the opinion of the Chief Building Official, there is actual
and immediate risk of failure or collapse of a building or structure or any
part thereof, or the existence of defective equipment or service facilities
such as to endanger life or health, or when any structure or part of a
structure has fallen or failed, and the use or occupancy of the structure,
equipment, service facility, or equipment or part thereof would, in his
opinion, endanger life or health, he is authorized and empowered to order and
require the occupants and inmates to vacate the same, or to cease, desist, and
refrain from the use or operation of the building, structure, equipment,
service facility, or part thereof which is deemed dangerous. If such order is
made, he shall cause to be posted a notice reading:
   “This (building) (and) (equipment) is unsafe and its use or occupancy or
operation is prohibited by law.”
   It shall be unlawful for any person thereafter to enter, use, or operate
such structure, equipment, service facility, or part thereof, except to repair
or demolish.
   (B)   The Chief Building Official shall also cause such work to be done as
may be necessary to render such structure, equipment, service facility, or part
temporarily safe with regard to passersby and adjacent properties, as well as
occupants, pending vacation and repair or demolition, whether or not he has
previously issued any order of vacation thereof. In lieu of attempting to make
such structure or part temporarily safe for passersby and adjacent properties,
he may, when necessary for the public safety, temporarily close such adjacent
properties and any affected sidewalks, streets, and other public ways and
areas, and prohibit the use thereof. In causing any such work to be performed,
he shall employ or engage such labor and use or purchase materials as may be
necessary to accomplish the same as expeditiously as possible.

§ 150.087 NO LIABILITY ON PUBLIC UTILITIES OR PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
   No liability shall be imposed on any public service company or public
authority for failure to render service, or for disconnecting service to any
person or place where such failure or disconnection is based on the nonissuance

order hereunder by the Chief Building Official to disconnect such service,
including, but not limited to, the following:
   (A)   Failure or refusal to render service to any person or place which does
not present a certificate of occupancy as required by this Building Code, or a

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution, grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, City Council ordains this chapter.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes the methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

§ 152.08 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that the land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

§ 152.22 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Chief Building Official is hereby appointed to administer and implement
this chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in
accordance with its provisions.
(‘74 Code, § 153.22) (Ord. 93-1055, passed 2-23-93)
§ 152.23 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF BUILDING OFFICIAL.
   (A)   Permit review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 USC 1 et seq.
and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1251 et seq.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may be delineated in other sources of flood
information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of §
152.37 is met.
   (B)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with §
152.04 are designated as Zone A on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Within these areas, the Building Official shall obtain, review and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other sources, including data obtained under §
152.36(F), in order to administer §
152.36(A) and (B); and §
152.37.
   (C)   Information to be obtained and maintained.  Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and whether or not such structures contain a basement.
      (2)   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed structures:
         (a)   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         (b)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
152.20.
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Alteration of watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in §
152.20 that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that the necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
   (E)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretation, where needed,
as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood
hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped
boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of
the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in §
152.24.
(‘74 Code, § 153.23) (Ord. 93-1055, passed 2-23-93)
§ 152.24 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Planning Commission as established by the city shall hear and
decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Building Official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Planning Commission shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The cost of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of subdivision (4) of this
division and the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further
the purposes of this chapter.
      (6)   The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items (a) through (k) in division (A)(4)
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
division (A), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.

§ 152.37 FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Areas with floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in §
152.04 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as
floodways. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in §
152.23. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subdivision (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §
152.36.
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Building Official to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (B)   Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazards where
FEMA has provided base flood elevation data as set forth in §
152.04, but FEMA has not delineated a floodway, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   If subdivision (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter.

or another code or ordinance, the responsibility of more than one code official

involved to coordinate their inspections and administrative orders as fully as
practicable so that the owners and occupants of the structure shall not be
subjected to visits by numerous inspectors or multiple or conflicting orders.

compliance with the provisions of this code, or evidence that a material or
method does not conform to the requirements of this code, or in order to
substantiate claims for alternative materials or methods, the Code Official
shall have the authority to require tests to be made as evidence of compliance
at no expense to the City of Mt. Healthy.

interior wall or ceiling finished exposing the structure, unless there is an
attic, crawl space or basement available which could provide access for
interconnection without the removal of interior finishes.

an exemption, during the period of the exemption the structure shall not be
considered to be an improvement on the land on which it is located for the

(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.002 PURPOSE.
   This Code shall have the purposes prescribed in R.C. Chapter 713 and is
enacted for the following additional purposes:
   (A)   To promote the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity
and general welfare;
   (B)   To conserve and protect property and owner investment;

   (D)   To guide the density of population;
   (E)   To manage and support efficient travel modes;
   (F)   To provide a method of administration and to prescribe penalties for

(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.004 EFFECT OF OTHER REGULATIONS.
   The regulations of this Code shall be in addition to any other regulations
in effect in the city. All building, subdividing, and uses within any district
shall satisfy all building, planning, platting, zoning, and any other related
regulations.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.005 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CODES, ORDINANCES OR AGREEMENTS.
   This Code does not repeal or annul any code, ordinance, regulation, permit,
easement, covenant, or private agreement previously adopted, issued, or entered

regulations of this Code are more restrictive or impose higher standards than

§ 155.007 RULES APPLYING TO THE TEXT.
   (A)   The words, terms and phrases used in this Code shall have the meanings
assigned to them in §§
155.211 through
155.2192, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning.
   (B)   Rules of construction. The following rules of construction apply to
this Code:
      (1)   The particular shall control the general and the use of a general
term shall not be taken to have the same meaning as another specific term. For
example, a "dry cleaning retail establishment" shall not be interpreted to be
the same as a "retail business supplying commodities on the premises," if each
term is listed as a separate and distinct use.
      (2)   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this Code and any caption or illustration, the text shall control.
      (3)   A building or structure includes any and all of its parts.
      (4)   The phrase "used for" includes "arranged for," "designed for,"
"intended for," "maintained for" and "occupied for."
      (5)   The word "shall" is always mandatory and not discretionary. The
word "may" is permissive.
      (6)   The word "person" includes any individual, corporation,
partnership, incorporated association, limited liability company or any other
similar entity.
      (7)   Unless the context clearly indicates the contrary, where a
regulation involves two or more items, conditions, provisions or events
connected by the conjunctions "and," "or" or "either . . . or," the conjunction
shall be interpreted as follows:
         (a)   "And" indicates that all of the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events apply.
         (b)   "Or" indicates that the connected items, conditions, provisions
or events may apply singly or in any combination.
         (c)   "Either . . . or" indicates that the connected items,
conditions, provisions or events apply singly but not in combination.
   (C)   Terms not defined in this Code shall have the meaning customarily
assigned to them.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.008 SEVERABILITY.
   If a provision of this Zoning Code is found to be invalid by any court of
competent jurisdiction, that invalidation shall not affect any other provision
of this Code unless the other provision is also found to be invalid.

§ 155.012 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (A)   The boundaries of the zoning districts are established as shown on the
map entitled, "City of Mt. Healthy Official Zoning District Map" which
accompanies and is made a part of this Code.
   (B)   The Official Zoning District Map shall be maintained and kept on file
by the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   The City Council may, at its discretion or upon formal application,
amend the zoning map, in accordance with the amendment procedures of Subchapter
155.19.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.013 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES INTERPRETED.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts, as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   When the exact boundaries of a district are uncertain, they shall be
determined by use of the scale on the zoning map.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow those centerlines.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines
shall be construed as following those lot lines.
   (D)   Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to
follow the shoreline. In the event of change in the shoreline, the boundary
shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as
approximately following the center line of streams, rivers or other bodies of
water shall be construed to follow the centerline. Any use of structures
extending into or over a water body shall be subject to the same zoning
restrictions as the adjoining land.
   (E)   When a right-of-way is vacated, the districts adjoining each side are
respectively extended to the center of the area so vacated.
   (F)   If the rules above are not sufficient to resolve the issue, the
Planning Commission shall make the determination by resolution.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.014 ANNEXED LAND.

155.19.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.015 LOTS DIVIDED BY ZONING LINE.
   Where a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the entire lot shall be
considered to be wholly within the more restrictive zoning district.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.016 USES NOT LISTED.
   (A)   A use that is not listed, either by right or by conditional approval,
in a zoning district shall not be permitted in that district and shall only be
permitted in a district where it is specifically listed as either a use by
right or by conditional approval.
   (B)   If a proposed use of land or building is not specified by this Code in
any district, the City Manager or designee shall determine if the use is
similar to a permitted or conditional land use authorized in the district in
which the land or building is located. If the use is found to be similar, it
may be established in accordance with the requirements and procedures
established in the Code for the similar use. The City Manager or designee shall
notify the Planning Commission of this action, who shall then determine if the
Code should be amended to specifically include the use.
   (C)   Alternatively, the City Manager or designee may refer the
determination to the Planning Commission in the first instance.
   (D)   The determination by the City Manager or designee, or the Planning
Commission, may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals; provided, the
appeal may only be taken by the affected property owner or the owner's agent.

155.03 BUSINESS DISTRICTS
§ 155.031 PURPOSE.
   (A)   "CBD," Central Business District. The CBD Zoning District serves as
the focal point for the social and commercial activities of the city. The
integration of business, institutional, public, quasi-public, cultural,
residential and other related uses is permitted and encouraged. Uses in this
district, for the most part, are intended to promote pedestrian movement and
social interaction and should be of a scale and character that is consistent
with the small town ambiance of the City of Mt. Healthy.
   (B)   "E," General Business District. The E District accommodates general
retail and/or auto-dependent businesses. Uses within this district typically
require high visibility, major arterial frontage, good access and ample
parking. While these uses are provided for, the E District is intended to be
limited to a confined area so as to prevent the creation of a commercial strip
and a proliferation of uses that would detract from the central business hub of
the community. E-1 Districts shall be regulated as E Districts for the purposes
of this Code.
   (C)   "OB," Office Business District. The OB District accommodates
commercial offices and other uses that may serve a greater concentration of
office uses than other commercial zoning districts in the city. Uses within
this district require high visibility, major arterial or collector frontage,
good access and ample parking. They may contain commercial offices designed to
function as a campus for technology, medical, call centers or other larger
scale corporate office configurations.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.032 SCHEDULE OF USES.
   Buildings or land shall not be used and buildings shall not be erected,
except for the following specified uses, unless otherwise provided for in this
Code. Land and/or buildings in the districts indicated at the top of Table
155.032 may be used for the purposes denoted by the following abbreviations:
   (A)   Permitted use (P). Land and/or buildings in this district may be used
by right.
   (B)   Accessory use (A). Uses that are permitted as part of the principal
use of the land and/or building within the specific zoning district.
   (C)   Conditional use (C). Land and/or buildings in this district may be
permitted only if conditional use approval is granted, upon a finding that the
general requirements of subchapter

155.04 INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
§ 155.041 PURPOSE.
   (A)   "F," Light Industrial District. The F District is intended to provide
dedicated locations within the community for office, research, knowledge-based
industry, services, light manufacturing and related uses that offer employment
opportunities and create economic vitality for the city and its residents.
   (B)   "G," Industrial District. The G District establishes a location for
industrial and heavy commercial uses that provide significant employment
opportunities within the city. Uses in this district tend to be more intensive
than those in the G District and due to the potential for large truck traffic,
late hours of operation and other potentially deleterious effects on the
surroundings and the community may require conditional use review.

155.06 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
§ 155.061 PURPOSE.
   The Planned Unit Develop ment (PUD) District is established as an optional
development tool to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development;
to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership and variety of design,
layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in
the use of land; to preserve significant natural, historical and architectural
features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide better housing,
employment and business opportunities particularly suited to residents; to
encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and to encourage
the use and improvement of existing sites when the uniform regulations
contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide adequate protection
and safeguards for the property and surrounding areas. It is the further intent
of the PUD regulations to promote a higher quality of development than can be
achieved from conventional zoning requirements in furtherance of the vision and
goals of the adopted Mt. Healthy Comprehensive Plan.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.062 QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.
   In order to qualify for PUD approval, the project must satisfy the
conditions of this section. It is the applicant's responsibility to
demonstrate, in writing, that each of the following criteria is or will be met
by the proposed PUD:
   (A)   Recognizable benefit. A PUD shall achieve recognizable and substantial
benefits that would not be possible under the existing zoning classification
(s). At least three of the following benefits shall be accrued to the community
as a result of the proposed PUD:
      (1)   Preservation of significant natural features,
      (2)   A complementary mix of land uses or housing types,
      (3)   Extensive open space and recreational amenities,
      (4)   Connectivity of open space with new or existing adjacent greenway
or trail corridors,
      (5)   Preservation of small-town appeal,
      (6)   Improvements to public streets or other public facilities that
mitigate traffic and/or other development impacts,
      (7)   Coordinated development of multiple small parcels,
      (8)   Or removal or renovation of blighted buildings, sites or
contamination clean-up.
   (B)   Size. Each PUD shall contain a minimum of five acres; provided sites
containing less than five acres may be considered for rezoning to PUD, if the
City Council determines that the site will advance the purposes of the PUD
District. When determining the appropriateness of areas less than the
applicable minimum required, the City Council shall determine that:
      (1)   Rezoning the area to PUD will not result in a significant adverse
effect upon nearby or adjacent city lands;
      (2)   The proposed uses will complement the character of the surrounding
area;
      (3)   The purpose and qualifying conditions of the PUD District can be
achieved within a smaller area; and
      (4)   The PUD is not being used as a means to circumvent conventional
zoning requirements.
   (C)   Utilities. The PUD shall be served by public water and sanitary sewer.
   (D)   Ownership. The PUD application shall be filed by the property owner,
lessee or other person with legal interest in the property and written consent
by the owner. The proposed development shall be under unified ownership or
control, so one person or entity has proprietary responsibility for the full
completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation
of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or
deed restrictions indicating that the development will be completed in its
entirety as proposed.
   (E)   Comprehensive Plan and vision. Proposed uses and design of the PUD
shall be substantially consistent with the city's adopted Comprehensive Plan
and the principles for land stewardship contained in the Healthy Hilltops Plan.
   (F)   Pedestrian accommodation. The PUD shall provide for integrated, safe
and abundant pedestrian and bicycle access and movement within the PUD and to
adjacent properties.
   (G)   Architecture. Building forms, relationships, scale and styles shall be
harmonious and visually integrated.
   (H)   Traffic. The PUD shall provide for safe and efficient vehicular
movement within, into and out of the PUD site. Traffic calming techniques,
parking lot landscaping, and other sustainable design solutions shall be
employed to improve traffic circulation, storm water management, pedestrian
safety and aesthetic appeal.
   (I)   Eligible districts. Land within any zoning district may qualify for
PUD zoning.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.063 PUD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Permitted uses. Any use permitted by right or conditional approval in
any zoning district may be permitted within a PUD, subject to the provisions of
§
155.062, Qualifying Conditions and the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Minimum lot size and zoning requirements. Lot area, width, setbacks,
height, lot coverage, minimum floor area, parking, landscaping, lighting and
other requirements for the district applicable to the proposed use, as provided
in Table
155.063, shall be applicable for all such uses within a PUD, unless modified in
accordance with division (D) of this section. In the case of a mix of uses, the
zoning requirements applicable to each use category shall apply to that use.

to a land use in the PUD may be altered from the requirements specified in
Table 155.063, including but not limited to, modification from the lot area and
width, building setbacks, height, lot coverage, signs and parking. The
applicant for a PUD shall identify, in writing, all intended deviations from
the zoning requirements. Modifications may be approved by the City Council
during the preliminary development plan review stage, after Planning Commission
recommendation. These adjustments may be permitted only if they will result in
a higher quality and more sustainable development consistent with the purposes
of PUD expressed in §
155.061. The modifications shall also satisfy at least four of the following
criteria:

   (F)   Open space. At least 15% of the area of a PUD site shall be preserved
as open space, in accordance with the following requirements. For purposes of
this requirement, "green roofs" shall be counted as open space.
      (1)   Areas not considered open space. The following land areas shall not
be counted as required open space for the purposes of this section:
         (a)   The area within any public street right-of-way or private street
easement;
         (b)   Any easement for overhead utility lines, unless adjacent to
qualified open space;
         (c)   Storm water detention ponds; provided rain gardens or ponds
designed as water features that may also provide for storm water storage may be
counted toward required open space;
         (d)   Fifty percent of any flood plain, wetland, water body or steep
slope (15% or greater) area and 50% of the area of any golf course;
         (e)   The area within a platted lot, unless the lot has been dedicated
to open space on the plat via conservation easement or other means of ensuring
that the lot is permanent open space; and
         (f)   Parking and loading areas.
      (2)   Specifications for required open space. Required open space areas

         (f)   Shall be of sufficient size and dimension and located,
configured, or designed in such a way as to achieve the applicable purposes of
this chapter and enhance the quality of the development. The open space shall
neither be perceived nor function simply as an extension of the rear yard of
those lots abutting it;
         (g)   To the extent practical, open space areas shall be linked with
adjacent open spaces, public parks, bicycle paths or pedestrian paths;
         (h)   Pedestrian access points to the required open space areas from
the interior of the PUD shall be provided and clearly identified by signs or a
visible improved path for safe and convenient access;
         (i)   Grading shall be minimal, with the intent to preserve existing
topography and landscaping where practical; and
         (j)   May contain ball fields, tennis courts, swimming pools and
related buildings, community buildings, golf courses, and similar recreational

§ 155.064 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Conditions. Reasonable conditions may be imposed upon the PUD approval
by the Planning Commission and/or City Council. The conditions imposed shall be
recorded in the minutes of the approval action, and shall remain unchanged
except upon amendment of the PUD in accordance with the procedures of §
155.067. Conditions may include, but are not limited to, those necessary to:
      (1)   Ensure public services and facilities will be capable of
accommodating increased loads;
      (2)   Protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and
energy;
      (3)   Ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land;
      (4)   Meet the intent and purpose of this Code;
      (5)   Be related to the standards established in the Code for the
proposed PUD;
      (6)   Ensure compliance with the final development plan and the
provisions of this Code.
   (B)   Performance guarantees. The City Council or Planning Commission may
require reasonable performance guarantees, in accordance with §
155.154 to ensure completion of specified improvements within the PUD.
   (C)   Interior streets. Public or private streets may be required to be
extended to exterior lot lines in order to allow connection to existing or
planned streets on adjacent parcels, so as to provide for secondary access,
continuity of the circulation system and to reduce traffic on collector
streets.
   (D)   Time limits. Each PUD shall be under construction within 12 months
after the date of approval of the final development plan. If this requirement
is not met, the City Council may, in its discretion, grant extensions not
exceeding 12 additional months for each such extension; provided that prior to
the expiration of the initial 12 month period and any subsequent extension, the
applicant submits reasonable evidence in writing to the effect that unforeseen
difficulties or special circumstances have been encountered, causing delay in
commencement of the PUD. If the PUD has not been commenced within the initial
12 month approval period, or within an authorized extension thereof, any

sustain a property or home owners association, if applicable.
   (C)   Preliminary PUD plan and rezonnng.
      (1)   Planning Commission review. Upon receipt of the PUD application and
related materials, the Planning Commission shall conduct a work session with
the applicant to review the development concept and determine the need for
additional information and referral to the Architectural Review Board prior to
conducting a public hearing.
      (2)   Additional information. If required by the Planning Commission, the
applicant shall submit additional information and/or studies to support the
request such as, but not limited to: impact assessment, traffic analysis, storm

recommendation to the City Council to approve, disapprove, or approve with
modifications the request for PUD zoning and the preliminary development plan.
      (5)   City Council action. Upon receipt of the Planning Commission
recommendation, the City Council shall review the preliminary development plan,
the record of the Planning Commission proceedings, the standards of §
155.066 and the recommendation of the Planning Commission and shall approve,
disapprove, or approve with modifications the preliminary development plan and
rezoning request.
      (6)   Zoning map. If the PUD zoning is approved, the Zoning Administrator
shall cause the zoning map to be changed to indicate the planned unit
development. If the preliminary development plan is approved with
modifications, the applicant shall file with the Zoning Administrator written
notice of consent to the modifications and a properly revised preliminary
development plan prior to the map being changed.
   (D)   Final development plan. Within 12 months of the City Council's
approval of the preliminary development plan and PUD rezoning, the applicant
shall submit a final development plan for the entire PUD or one or more phases
to the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with the requirements for final site
plan review as contained in §
155.135. If determined to be complete by the Zoning Administrator, copies of
the plan shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Phased projects. If the PUD is to be developed in phases, the final
development plan may be submitted for one or more phases of the overall PUD. A
tentative schedule for the completion of each phase and commencement of the
next phase shall also be submitted for Planning Commission approval.
      (2)   Extension of time limit. One extension of the time period for
submitting the final development plan may be granted by the City Council for up
to an additional 12 months, if a request is submitted by the applicant, in
writing, prior to the expiration of the original 12 month approval period. If
an application for final development plan approval has not been submitted prior
to the expiration of the original 12 months or an approved extension, the
preliminary development plan shall be null and void. In addition, the Planning
Commission or City Council may initiate a rezoning of the property to another
zoning district.
      (3)   Subdivision plat. For any PUD requiring subdivision plat approval,
the subdivision plat shall be submitted simultaneously with the final
development plan and reviewed concurrently as part of the PUD.
      (4)   Review and action. The Planning Commission shall review the final
development plan in relation to its conformance with the preliminary
development plan and any conditions or modifications attached to the PUD
rezoning by the City Council. If it is determined that the final plan does not
substantially conform with the preliminary development plan, the review process
shall be conducted as a preliminary development plan review, in accordance with
§ 155.065(B). If the final development plan is consistent with the approved
preliminary development plan, the Planning Commission shall review the final
plan in accordance with the standards for site plan review, and the PUD
standards of §
155.066. The Planning Commission shall prepare a record of its findings and
shall approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications the final development
plan.
   (E)   PUD agreement.
      (1)   Prior to issuance of any building permits or commencement of
construction on any portion of the PUD, the applicant shall enter into an
agreement with the city, in recordable form, setting forth the applicant's
obligations with respect to the PUD.
      (2)   The agreement shall describe all improvements to be constructed as
part of the PUD and shall incorporate, by reference, the final development plan
with all required modifications, other documents which comprise the approved
PUD, and all conditions attached to the approval by the city.
      (3)   A phasing plan shall also be submitted, if applicable, describing
the intended schedule for start and completion of each phase and the
improvements to be undertaken in each phase.
      (4)   The agreement shall also establish the remedies of the city in the
event of default by the applicant in carrying out the PUD, and shall be binding
on all successors in interest to the applicant.
      (5)   All documents shall be executed and recorded in Hamilton County.

meet all of the following general standards:
   (A)   The PUD will comply with the standards, conditions, and requirements
of this chapter.
   (B)   The PUD will promote the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (C)   The proposed project will be compatible with adjacent uses of land,
the natural environment, and the capacities of public services and facilities
affected by the proposed project.

safety, and welfare needs of the city.
   (E)   Granting the PUD rezoning will result in a recognizable and
substantial benefit to ultimate users of the project and to the community,

zoning districts.
   (F)   The PUD will not result in a significant increase in the need for
public services and facilities and will not place a significant burden upon
surrounding lands or the natural environment, unless the resulting adverse
effects are adequately provided for or mitigated by features of the PUD as
approved.
   (G)   The PUD will be consistent with the city's Comprehensive Plan and the
Healthy Hilltops Plan. Specifically, the following planning principles shall be
adhered to, as applicable:
      (1)   Redevelopment and infill locations should be favored over
greenfield development;
      (2)   Natural features and resources should be preserved or at least
conserved;
      (3)   Future development/redevelopment shall strengthen the physical
character of the city;
      (4)   Quality design is emphasized for all uses to create an attractive,

Code, fences, walls and foliage are permitted in required yards under the
following conditions:
      (1)   Only decorative fencing as regulated below shall be permitted in
the front yard. The height shall not exceed four feet in the front yard,
including both front yards of a corner or through lot, except within the clear
vision triangle (see §
155.092(B)) which shall be three feet.
         (a)   A decorative fence shall be limited in type to types commonly
referred to as split rail, wrought iron, or decorative metal, wood picket
fence, but shall exclude chain link wire fences or otherwise permitted
decorative fences less than 30% open to light and air.
      (2)   Fences, walls and foliage adjacent to any public sidewalk shall be
set back at least one foot from the inside of the sidewalk.
      (3)   Visibility into and out of any driveway or street shall remain
unobstructed.
      (4)   Within a side or rear yard in a residential district, no fence or
wall shall be permitted to exceed a height of six feet, measured from the

      (5)   In residential districts, if both sides of the fence are not
identical, the finished side shall face the adjoining property.

feet in height, provided for each foot exceeding six feet, there shall be a one
and one-half foot setback from side property lines.
         (a)   Except fences for permitted recreational and agricultural uses
where no height limitation shall apply.
      (7)   Barbed wire or electrically charged fences may be erected in
nonresidential districts, provided the electrically charged or barbed section
of the fence shall be no lower than seven feet above grade.
      (8)   Fences, walls or foliage erected or maintained above or within
utility easements shall be subject to removal, as necessary, to provide access
to such easements.
   (B)   Temporary buildings and structures.
      (1)   Construction buildings and structures, including trailers,
incidental to construction work on a lot, may be placed on that lot, subject to
the following:
         (a)   Construction buildings and structures may only be used for the

management and supervision offices, and for temporary on-site sanitation
facilities related to construction activity on the lot. An enclosed structure
for temporary sanitation facilities shall be required on all construction
sites.
         (b)   No construction building or structure shall be used as a
dwelling unit.
         (c)   A permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator prior
to installation of a construction building or structure.
         (d)   Construction buildings and structures shall be removed from the

the expiration of a building permit issued for construction on the lot.
      (2)   Sales offices or model homes may be placed on a lot subject to the
following:
         (a)   A permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Administrator prior
to installation or construction. The permit shall specify the location of the

building is still incidental and necessary.
         (b)   Only transactions related to the development in which the
temporary building is located shall be conducted within the building. General
offices for real estate, construction, development or other related businesses
associated with the project shall not be permitted.
   (C)   Dumpsters. All uses that maintain garbage dumpsters on site shall
provide a screened enclosure by means fence/wall, or a combination thereof
equal in height to the dumpster as regulated by §
155.091. All such garbage collection areas shall be located in the rear yard

nonconforming and are not entitled to any consideration under the provisions of
Subchapter
155.19.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.092 DIMENSIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Average front setback. The minimum front setback requirements for a
principal building in any residential district may be reduced in accordance
with the following:
      (1)   Where two or more lots entirely or partially within 200 feet of a
subject lot, on the same side of the street and the same block, are occupied by
principal buildings whose existing front setback is less than required by the
zoning district, the average of the established setbacks for those buildings
shall be the minimum required front setback for the subject lot.
      (2)   In no case, however, shall the front yard setback for a garage,
whether attached or detached, be less than 20 feet in order to provide adequate
vehicle parking space in front of the garage without blocking a sidewalk or
otherwise impeding pedestrian movement.
   (B)   Clear vision corner. Fences, walls, structures, shrubbery or other
potential obstructions to vision, except utility poles, lights and street
signs, shall not be permitted to exceed a height of three feet within a
triangular area formed by the intersection of the street right-of-way lines and
a line connecting two points located on those intersecting right-of-way lines
20 feet from the point of intersection with the right- of-way lines.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7290.png]
   (C)   Cul-de-sac lots. In the case of lots abutting the turn-around radius
of a cul-de-sac street, the minimum required lot width shall be measured at the
required front setback line; provided all such cul-de-sac lots shall have a
minimum width of 40 feet at the front lot line.
   (D)   Height exceptions. Height limits specified elsewhere in this Zoning
Code shall not apply to:
      (1)   Churches, schools, hospitals and public buildings including, but
not limited to: libraries, museums, art galleries, fire stations or public
buildings of a cultural, recreational or administrative nature.
      (2)   Barns, silos or other buildings or structures on farms; church
spires, belfries, cupolas and domes; monuments; transmission towers; windmills;
chimneys; smokestacks; flagpoles; and radio towers, masts and aerials. These
structures shall be limited to 100 feet in height in any case, unless otherwise
permitted in this Code.
      (3)   Structures needed as part of an industrial facility where the
manufacturing process requires a greater height; provided, however, that all
such structures shall be limited to 25% of the area of the lot and shall meet
all yard setback requirements for a principal building, but in no case less
than 25 feet.
   (E)   Minimum lot frontage. Any lot created after the effective date of this
Code shall have frontage on an improved public street or approved private
street or access easement, equal to the minimum required lot width in the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (F)   Required yards or lots. No lot or lots in common ownership and no
yard, court, parking area or other space shall be so divided, altered or
reduced as to make the area or space less than the minimum size required by
this Code. If already less than the minimum size required, the area or space
shall not be further divided or reduced.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.093 PARKING AND STORAGE.
   (A)   Outdoor storage. Outdoor storage of merchandise, equipment, supplies,
products or other materials shall only be permitted in those districts and

   (B)   Recreational vehicle parking. It shall be unlawful for any person to
park or cause to be parked any mobile home or recreational vehicle on any
street, alley, highway, or other public place in the city and to use the same
as a dwelling. This provision shall not prohibit the temporary occupancy for
periods up to 72 hours of a recreational vehicle; provided the recreational
vehicle contains sleeping accommodations, is parked on a paved lot per
Subchapter
155.11 in a residential district, located behind the frontage of the primary
building, and is for the use of the owner of that lot or guests of the owner.
Vehicles longer than 40 feet in length and taller than 14 feet are prohibited.
Vehicles regulated in this section that exceed 24 feet in length shall meet
following setback requirements:
      (1)   Recreational vehicles greater than 24 feet but less than or equal
to 35 feet in overall length and up to ten feet in height shall maintain a side
and rear yard setback of no less than five feet;
      (2)   Recreational vehicles greater than 24 feet but less than or equal
to 35 feet in overall length and greater than ten feet up to 14 feet in height
shall maintain a side and rear yard setback of no less than ten feet;
      (3)   Recreational vehicles greater than 35 feet but less than or equal
to 40 feet in overall length and up to ten feet in height shall maintain a side
and rear yard setback of no less than ten feet;
      (4)   Recreational vehicles greater than 35 feet but less than or equal
to 40 feet in overall length and greater than ten feet up to 14 feet in height
shall maintain a side and rear yard setback of no less than 20 feet.
   (C)   Storage and repair of vehicles.
      (1)   The repair, restoration and maintenance of vehicles in any
residential district, shall be conducted entirely within an enclosed building,
except for those activities that can be and are completed in less than 48
hours. All such repair shall take place on private property and may not be
conducted within the public right-of-way.
      (2)   It shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant or lessee of any
building or lands within the city to permit the open storage or parking of any
inoperable motor vehicle, machinery or equipment, or parts thereof, outside of
an enclosed garage or enclosed building, for a period of more than 48 hours. An
inoperable motor vehicle for purposes of this division shall include motor
vehicles which, by reason of dismantling, disrepair or other cause, are
incapable of being propelled under their own power, or are unsafe for operation
on the streets and highways of this state because of the inability to comply
with the State Motor Vehicles and Traffic Code, or do not have a current
license and registration, as required for operation by the State Motor Vehicles
and Traffic Code.
      (3)   It shall be unlawful for the owner, tenant or lessee of any lot or
building in a residential district to permit the open storage or parking
outside of a building of semi-truck tractors and/or semi-truck trailers,
bulldozers, earth carriers, cranes or any other similar equipment or machinery,
unless parked for purposes of construction being conducted on that lot.

   (A)   Accessory buildings and structures.
      (1)   Accessory buildings or garages shall be considered to be part of
the principal building and subject to all setback requirements of the principal
building, if structurally and architecturally integrated into the building or
if attached by an enclosed breezeway or similar enclosed structure not greater
than three feet in length. Detached accessory buildings shall be located at
least three feet from any principal building.
      (2)   Accessory buildings and structures shall not be erected in any
front yard.
      (3)   Accessory buildings and structures may be erected in a rear yard if
set back at least ten feet from the rear and five feet from the side property

than 30% of the required rear yard.
      (4)   An accessory building or structure designed for and containing a
vehicle entrance to be accessed from an existing publicly dedicated and
commonly used alley may be located on the rear lot line, if parking space plans
have been approved by the Zoning Administrator.

155.10 CONDITIONAL USE REQUIREMENTS
§ 155.101 PURPOSE.
   Conditional uses are uses of land specifically permitted within a zoning
district only with the approval of City Council at the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, following a review of the use and its potential impact on
its surroundings. These uses are generally consistent with the purpose of the
zoning district in which they are permitted but, due to unique operational
characteristics, may not be desirable or compatible in all locations within the
district. Factors such as traffic, hours of operation, noise, odor or similar
potential nuisance effects require that the conditional use be evaluated
relative to its appropriateness on a case-by-case basis. This chapter
establishes the review procedure for conditional uses and the general standards
that must be met for all conditional uses. In addition, more specific
requirements are established for certain individual uses, as necessary, to
mitigate their potential negative impacts.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.102 PROCEDURES.
   Applications for conditional uses shall be considered by the Planning
Commission in accordance with the following procedures:
   (A)   Application. An application for conditional use approval shall be made
to the Planning Commission in writing, on a form for that purpose, and shall be
filed with the Zoning Administrator at least 20 days before the next regularly
scheduled meeting at which it is to be heard. The application must be
accompanied by a fee, as established by the City Council, a site plan in
accordance with the requirements of Subchapter
155.13 and such other material as the Commission determines necessary.
   (B)   Public notice. When an application has been filed in proper form with
the required data, the Clerk of Council shall cause notice of the time, place
and purpose of the hearing to be posted on the city's official digital media
platform and be given, in writing by first class mail, to the applicant(s), to
owners of property contiguous to and directly across the street from the
property that is the subject of the conditional use application. The notice
shall be given at least seven days in advance of the hearing, noting the
request and the property location. The name and address of any property owner
on the most recent property record of the Hamilton County Auditor shall be the
address used for public notification. If the address is unclear or uncertain,
the property owner may be notified by legal notice published one time via the
city's official digital media platform at least seven days in advance of any
hearing, listing the address of the property to receive notification.
   (C)   Sign. At least ten days prior to the scheduled public hearing, a
temporary sign six square feet in area shall be posted on the property subject
to a conditional use request by the applicant. The sign shall be removed within
three days following the public hearing at which the request was heard. The
sign shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The specific request being made,
      (2)   Date of the public hearing,
      (3)   Location of the public hearing, and
      (4)   Location where additional information may be obtained regarding the
request.

person or by agent. If the applicant or authorized representative is not
present, no action shall be taken by the Planning Commission on that
application.
   (E)   Record of proceedings. The Planning Commission shall keep minutes of
its proceedings showing the action of the Commission and the vote of each
member or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact. The Commission
shall act by resolution.
   (F)   Required vote. The concurring vote of three Planning Commission
members shall be necessary to approve a conditional use application.
   (G)   Review criteria. The Planning Commission shall review the application
in relation to the general standards of this chapter for conditional uses, as
provided in §
155.103, and any specific standards required for the use proposed, as
identified in this chapter. The Planning Commission may refer a conditional use
in the CBD Zoning District to the Architectural Review Board.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.103 GENERAL STANDARDS.

writing to the Zoning Administrator prior to the expiration of the initial
approval.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)

155.11 OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 155.111 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to prescribe regulations for off-street
parking of motor vehicles in residential and non-residential zoning districts;
to ensure by the provision of these regulations that adequate parking and
access is provided in a safe and convenient manner; and to afford reasonable
protection to adjacent land uses from light, noise, air pollution and other
effects of parking areas.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.112 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Applicability of parking requirements. For all buildings and uses
established after the effective date of this Code, with the exception of
division (D) of this section, new off-street parking shall not be required
unless otherwise determined by the Planning Commission. If new parking, drive-
thru stacking, or loading areas are created, they shall be provided by the
standards of this chapter. The Planning Commission may choose to enact off-
street parking requirements under these standards:
      (1)   Whenever use of a building or lot is changed to another
classification of use, off-street parking facilities shall be provided, as
required by this chapter.
      (2)   If the intensity of use of any building or lot is increased,
through the addition of floor area, increase in seating capacity, number of
employees or other means, additional off-street parking shall be provided, as
required by this chapter.
      (3)   Off-street parking facilities in existence on the effective date of
this Code shall not be reduced below the requirements of this chapter, nor
shall nonconforming parking facilities that exist as of the effective date of
this Code be further reduced or made more nonconforming.
      (4)   An area designated as required off-street parking shall not be
changed to another use, unless equal facilities are provided elsewhere in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Location. Off-street parking facilities required for all uses other
than single- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the lot or within 300
feet of the building(s) or use they are intended to serve, as measured along
lines of public access from the nearest point of the parking facility to the
building(s) or use served. Off-street parking facilities required for single-
and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as
the building they are intended to serve, and shall consist of a parking strip,
parking apron, and/or garage. All residential driveways shall meet city
engineering standards. In the B-1, Central Business District, parking
facilities shall be located within 600 feet of the building or use to be
served.
   (C)   Shared/common parking.
      (1)   Two or more buildings or uses may share a common parking facility,
provided the number of parking spaces available equals the required number of
spaces for all the uses computed separately. Cumulative parking requirements
for mixed-use developments or shared facilities may be reduced by the Planning
Commission where it can be determined that one or more of the factors listed in
division (D) of this section apply.
      (2)   Parking facilities for a church or place of worship may be used to
meet not more than 50% of the off-street parking for theaters, stadiums and
other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings and industrial
establishments lying within 600 feet of a church or place of worship, as
measured along lines of public access; provided, the church or place of worship
makes the spaces available and there is no conflict between times when the uses
are in need of the parking facilities.
   (D)   Handicap parking. Handicapped parking spaces shall be provided
according to Table 155.112.
Table 155.112: Handicap Parking Requirements
Parking Spaces Provided Handicapped Spaces Required
Table 155.112: Handicap Parking Requirements

501+                    2% of total spaces provided + 1 handicap space for each
                        100 spaces over 1,000
 
Handicapped parking spaces shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide and 20 feet long,
and shall be clearly designated by signs.
NOTE: Division (D) of this section shall affect only those uses not regulated
by the Ohio Basic Building Code.
   (E)   Modification of parking requirements. The Planning Commission may
reduce the parking space requirements of this chapter for any use, based upon a
finding that other forms of travel are available and likely to be used and, in
particular, the site design will incorporate both bicycle parking facilities
and pedestrian connections. In addition, one or more of the following
conditions shall also be met:
      (1)   Shared parking by multiple uses where there will be a high
proportion of multipurpose visits or where uses have peak parking demands
during differing times of the day or days of the week and meeting the following
requirements:
         (a)   Pedestrian connections shall be maintained between the uses.
         (b)   For separate lots, shared parking areas shall be adjacent to
each other, with pedestrian and vehicular connections maintained between the
lots.
         (c)   Unless the multiple uses all are within a unified business
center, office park or industrial park all under the same ownership, shared
parking agreements shall be filed with the Clerk of Council after approval by
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Convenient municipal off-street parking or on-street spaces are
located adjacent to the subject property.
      (3)   Expectation of walk-in trade is reasonable due to sidewalk
connections to adjacent residential neighborhoods or employment centers. To
allow for a parking space reduction, the site design shall incorporate
pedestrian connections to the site and on-site pedestrian circulation,
providing safe and convenient access to the building entrance.
      (4)   Where the applicant has provided a parking study, conducted by a
qualified traffic engineer, demonstrating that another standard would be more
appropriate based on actual number of employees, expected level of customer
traffic, or actual counts at a similar establishment.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may require a parking study to document
that any one or more of the criteria (1) through (4) above would be met.
   (F)   Deferred parking.
      (1)   Where a reduction in the number of parking spaces is not warranted,
but an applicant demonstrates that the parking requirements for a proposed use
would be excessive, the Planning Commission may defer some of the required
parking. A site plan shall designate portions of the site for future
construction of the required parking spaces, meeting the design and dimensional
requirements of this chapter. Any area so designated shall be maintained in a
landscaped appearance and not occupy required buffers, greenbelts or parking
lot setbacks, or be used for any other purpose. Landscaping, such as parking
lot trees, that would otherwise be required for the deferred spaces shall be
installed within the deferred parking area.
      (2)   The deferred parking shall meet the requirements of this chapter,
if constructed. Construction of the additional parking spaces within the
deferred parking area may be initiated by the owner or required by the city,
based on parking needs or observation, and shall require approval of an amended
site plan.
   (G)   Temporary parking. It is recognized that there may be special events
or situations that occur infrequently which would result in a temporary
reduction in the availability of required parking spaces or create a need for
temporary off-site parking. Such events could include outdoor vehicle sales,
festivals, fairs, church/school car washes or garage sales. In those instances,
the Zoning Administrator may authorize the temporary use of the required
parking area or temporary off-site parking upon a demonstration by the
applicant that:
      (1)   The loss of the required parking spaces may be off-set by requiring
employees or customers to park elsewhere or that due to the time of year or
nature of the on-site business, the required spaces are not needed;
      (2)   Permission has been granted by neighboring property owners or
operators to use their parking facilities;
      (3)   The duration of the special event is so short or of such a nature
as to not create any parking problems for the normal operation of the existing
on-site use;
      (4)   Temporary off-site parking is located and designed to ensure safe
and efficient circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles (a site plan may be
required to demonstrate this);
      (5)   The proposed special event satisfies all other applicable city
regulations.
   (H)   Maximum allowed parking. In order to minimize excessive areas of
pavement that detract from aesthetics, contribute to high rates of storm water
runoff and generate reflective heat, the minimum parking space requirements of
this section shall not be exceeded by more than 10%, unless approved by the
Planning Commission as part of site plan review. In approving additional
parking space, the Planning Commission shall determine that the parking is
necessary, based on documented evidence, to accommodate the use on a typical
day.
   (I)   Downtown parking. The minimum off-street parking spaces required for
any nonresidential use in the CBD District shall be exempt from the
requirements of
Table 155.112. These requirements may be further reduced by the Planning
Commission in conformance with the provisions of division (D) of this section.
   (J)   Bicycle parking. Accommodation for bicycle parking is encouraged in
all districts, but especially in the Central Business District (CBD) zone.
   (K)   Required off-street parking spaces. The minimum number of required
off-street parking spaces shall be provided and maintained on the premises or
as otherwise allowed by this chapter, on the basis of the applicable
requirements of
Table 155.112a. As a condition of approval, the City Council may require that a
performance guarantee be posted, in accordance with the provisions of §
155.154.
      (1)   When units or measurements determining the number of required
parking spaces result in a fraction over one-half, a full parking space shall
be required.
      (2)   In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirement
for off-street parking facilities for a specified use which is most similar, as
determined by the Zoning Administrator, shall apply.
      (3)   Each 24 inches of bench, pew, or similar seating facilities shall
be counted as one seat, except if specifications and plans filed in conjunction
with a building permit application specify a maximum seating capacity, that
number may be used as the basis for required parking spaces.
      (4)   Where parking requirements are based upon maximum seating or
occupancy capacity, the capacity shall be as determined by the building code
and fire code.
      (5)   Unless otherwise indicated, floor area shall be usable floor area
(UFA).

   (A)   Location and setbacks. Off-street parking lots shall meet the setback
requirements applicable to parking, as specified in the zoning district or
requirements which may be specified for individual uses.
   (B)   Parking construction and development. The construction of any parking
lot shall require approval of a site plan, in accordance with Subchapter
155.13. Construction shall be completed and approved by the Zoning
Administrator before a certificate of occupancy is issued and the parking lot
is used.
      (1)   Pavement. All parking lots and vehicle and equipment storage areas
shall be paved with an asphalt or concrete binder, and shall be graded and
drained so as to dispose of surface water which might accumulate. The Planning
Commission may approve alternative paving materials, such as permeable/grass
pavers, for all or a portion of the parking areas, based upon credible evidence
of the durability and appearance of the proposed materials. For storage areas,
the Planning Commission may approve a substitute for hard-surfaced pavement
upon a determination that there are no adverse effects on adjoining properties.
      (2)   Drainage. Surface water from parking areas shall be managed in
accordance with the city engineering standards. The City Manager shall, in
consultation with the City Engineer, determine the appropriate detention
treatment. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with the
City Engineer's review.
      (3)   Dimensions. Parking space and aisle dimensions shall meet the
applicable requirements specified in
Table 155.113.
         (a)   Angled parking between these ranges shall be to the nearest
degree.
         (b)   Space length may be reduced by up to two feet if an unobstructed
overhang, such as a landscaped area or sidewalk, is provided. A sidewalk shall
have a minimum width of seven feet where abutting a parking area. There shall
be a minimum distance of seven feet between the parking lot curb and building.
Where curbing does not exist, bumper blocks shall be provided to protect
pedestrian space adjacent to the building.
         (c)   All parking lots shall be striped and maintained showing
individual parking bays, in accordance with the following dimensions.
      (4)   Stacking spaces. Waiting/stacking spaces for drive-through uses
(such as banks, restaurants, car washes, pharmacies, dry cleaners and oil
change establishments) shall be at least 24 feet long and ten feet wide.

that forms the boundary between a residential and non-residential district.
Except in the CBD Zoning District (downtown), access to nonresidential parking
lots shall meet the following standards:
         (a)   Ingress and egress driveways shall be located no closer than 50
feet to the intersecting right-of-way of two streets and no closer than three
feet to any adjoining property line.
         (b)   Driveways shall not exceed 30 feet in width, as measured at the

         (e)   Driveways shall be perpendicular or no more than 30° from
perpendicular to the curb.
         (f)   Driveways shall not be located closer than 25 feet to any
property line, unless approved as a shared driveway for two or more properties.
         (g)   All driveways shall be constructed in accordance with the city
engineering standards.
      (6)   Curbing. A six inch concrete curb, or alternative as determined by
the Planning Commission, shall be provided around all sides of any parking lot
of five or more spaces to protect landscaped areas, sidewalks, buildings, or
adjacent property from vehicles that might otherwise extend beyond the edge of
the parking lot. Curb openings are allowed for storm water drainage, as
recommended by the City Engineer. Plantings shall be set back two feet from
curbs to allow for bumper overhang.
      (7)   Landscaping. Off-street parking areas shall be landscaped and/or
buffered, in accordance with the requirements of Subchapter
155.14.
      (8)   Lighting. Light fixtures used to illuminate off-street parking
areas shall be arranged to deflect the light away from adjoining properties and
adjacent streets. Lighting fixtures in parking areas adjacent to any
residentially zoned or used property shall not exceed 20 feet in height.

be provided for wheelchair access.
         (b)   Maintenance. All parking areas shall be maintained free of trash
and debris. Surface, curbing, light fixtures and signage shall be maintained in
good condition.
         (c)   Limitations on use of parking lots.
            1.   Off-street parking areas are intended only for temporary
vehicle parking for public safety. Except when land is used as storage space in
connection with the business of a repair or service garage, use of parking
areas or open land is not permitted for the storage or parking of wrecked or
junked cars, or for creating a junk yard or nuisance.
            2.   Loading spaces, as required in §
155.114, and parking spaces, required in §
155.112, shall be considered separate and distinct requirements and shall be
provided as individual components on the site. In no case shall one component
be construed as meeting the requirements of the other.
            3.   Parking lots and loading areas shall not be used for the long-
term storage of trucks or trailers, except where such outdoor storage is
specifically permitted in the industrial district. Overnight parking or storage
of commercial vehicles shall be prohibited, except for uses and locations
approved for vehicle storage. This shall not be construed to prohibit the
parking overnight of commercial fleet vehicles or the short-term parking of
trailers in loading bays or staging areas in business or industrial districts.
            4.   It shall be unlawful to use a parking lot or open area to
store or park any vehicle for the purpose of displaying vehicles for sale,
except in an approved vehicle sales dealership.

155.12 SIGNAGE
§ 155.121   PURPOSE.
   The regulations of this subchapter are intended to protect and further the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Mt. Healthy; to
maintain and improve the appearance of the community; to conserve community
character; to prevent traffic hazards; to provide safe conditions for
pedestrians; and to promote economic development by regulating the
construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, size, location and number of
signs. It is further determined that to allow signs of excessive number and
size in the city would unduly distract pedestrians and motorists, create
traffic hazards and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the
public. The regulations of this subchapter are intended to provide reasonable
identification for businesses and other uses within the community; but are not
intended to serve as a means of advertising.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.122 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The following regulations are applicable to all signs in all zoning
districts.
   (A)   Sign structure and placement.
      (1)   Signs shall be constructed to withstand all wind and vibration
forces which can normally be expected to occur.
      (2)   Signs shall not be placed in, upon or over any public right-of-way,
alley, or other place, except as may be otherwise permitted by the Mt. Healthy
City Manager or Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).
      (3)   A light pole, utility pole, tree, fence or other supporting member
shall not be used for the placement of any sign, except as may be specifically
permitted by this chapter.
      (4)   A sign shall not be erected in any location where it may, by reason
of its position, shape, color, lighting or other characteristics, interfere
with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal, or device, or constitute a nuisance per se.
      (5)   No sign shall be placed in a manner as to obstruct any fire escape,
any required exit, door or window or any ventilation system or other
operational necessities of a building.
      (6)   A sign attached to a building shall not be placed in any location
that would cause significant architectural features of a building to be
covered, hidden or obscured.
      (7)   A wall sign shall not extend past the edge of the wall to which it
is affixed and no wall sign shall extend above the roof line of a building.
      (8)   A sign and its supporting mechanism shall not extend beyond any lot
lines of the property on which it is located.
      (9)   All signs shall be stationary and shall pertain only to the
business or activity conducted on the premises, except for permitted community
special event signs.
      (10)   One changeable message display may be permitted on either a
permitted freestanding ground sign or wall sign on a parcel, within the maximum
size limits permitted for the sign; provided the message is static and is not
changed more than once in any 12 hour period.
      (11)   Any vehicle which, in the opinion of the Zoning Administrator, has
the intended function of serving as a sign shall conform to the provisions of §
155.124(I).
   (B)   Measurement of sign area. No sign shall exceed the maximum sign area
allowed for the district in which it is located. The sign area is to be
expressed in square feet, computed to the nearest tenth of a square foot, and
shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   Area. The area of a sign shall be measured as the area within a
single, continuous perimeter composed of any straight line geometric figure
which encloses the extreme limits of writing, representation, emblem, logo or
any other figure of similar character, together with any frame or other
material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed,
excluding only the structure necessary to support the sign.
      (2)   Double-faced sign. The area of a ground or projecting sign that has
two or more faces shall be measured by including the area of all sign faces,
except if two faces are placed back-to-back and are no more than two feet apart
at any point, the area of one face shall be counted toward the maximum size
requirement. If the two back-to-back faces are of unequal size, the larger of
the two sign faces shall be counted as the one face.
      (3)   Wall sign. For a sign consisting of individual letters and/or a
logo affixed directly onto a building, the area of the sign shall be computed
by measuring the area of the envelope required to enclose the lettering and
logo.
      (4 )   Height. The height of a sign shall be measured as the vertical
distance from the highest point of the sign to the finished grade of the ground
immediately beneath the sign, excluding any artificially constructed earthen
berms.

IMAGES/0-0-0-7278.png]
 
      (5)   Multi-tenant buildings. For buildings with multiple tenants, the
sign area for wall, projecting, canopy or awning signs shall be determined by
taking that portion of the front wall of the building applicable to each tenant
and computing the sign requirements for that portion of the total wall.
   (C)   Illumination and movement.
      (1)   Unless otherwise provided, signs shall not be illuminated
internally. The source of the light for externally illuminated signs shall be
enclosed and directed to prevent light from shining directly onto traffic or
neighboring property and shall be directed in a downward manner to prevent
light pollution into the night sky.
      (2)   A sign shall not contain any moving or animated parts including
lighting, nor have the appearance of having moving or animated parts, except
for time and temperature signs, standard sized barber pole signs, scoreboards
and gasoline price signs as otherwise permitted.
      (3)   Neon signs shall only be permitted within the E District, but not
within 50 feet of a residential district unless the sign is not visible from
adjacent property within the residential district.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)

not be restored or rebuilt if reconstruction will constitute more than 50% of
the value of the sign on the date of the loss.
   (E)   Any sign which for a period of 60 days or more no longer identifies a
bona fide business conducted or product sold on the premises shall be removed
by the owner of the building, structure, or property upon which the sign is
located within 30 days of receipt of written notice from the Zoning
Administrator.
   (F)   A sign accessory to a nonconforming use on the premises may be
erected, in accordance with the sign regulations for the district in which the
property is located.

applicable to the subject request.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.136 REVIEW STANDARDS.
   A site plan shall be approved only upon a finding of compliance with the
following standards:
   (A)   The site plan must comply with all standards of this chapter and all
applicable requirements of this Code and all other applicable laws and
regulations.
   (B)   The site must be designed in a manner that is harmonious, to the
greatest extent possible, with the character of the surrounding area.
   (C)   The site must be designed so as to minimize hazards to adjacent
property, and to reduce the negative effects of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes
and glare to the maximum extent possible.
   (D)   Unless a more specific design standard is required by the city through
a different code, all uses and structures subject to site plan review shall
comply with the following design standards:
      (1)   Traffic circulation. The number, location, size of access and entry
points, and internal vehicular and pedestrian circulation routes shall be
designed to promote safe and efficient access to and from the site, and
circulation within the site. In reviewing traffic features, the number,
spacing, and alignment of existing and proposed access points shall be
considered relative to their impact on traffic movement on abutting streets and
adjacent properties.
      (2)   Storm water. Storm water detention and drainage systems shall be
designed so that the removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or public storm water drainage systems. Unless
impractical, storm water shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved
areas by underground surface drainage system. Low impact design solutions,
however, such as rain gardens and green roofs are encouraged.
      (3)   Landscaping. The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state,
insofar as practicable, by minimizing unnecessary tree and soil removal, and
any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general appearance of
neighboring developed areas. Provision or preservation of landscaping, buffers
or greenbelts may be required to ensure that the proposed uses will be
adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding property. Top soil
shall be left intact or stored on site, using best management practices, for
site restoration upon completion of the project.
      (4)   Screening. Where non-residential uses abut residential uses,
appropriate screening shall be provided, in accordance with Subchapter
155.14, so as to shield residential properties from noise, headlights, lighting
and glare.
      (5)   Lighting. Lighting shall be designed to minimize glare on adjacent
properties and public streets. As a condition of site plan approval, reduction
of lighting during non-business hours may be required.
      (6)   Utility service. All utility service shall be underground, unless
impractical.
      (7)   Exterior uses. Exposed storage areas, machinery, heating and
cooling units, service areas, loading areas, utility buildings and structures,
and similar accessory areas shall be located to have a minimum negative effect
on adjacent properties, and shall be visually and acoustically screened, if
reasonably necessary, to ensure compatibility with surrounding properties.
      (8)   Emergency access. All buildings and structures including any Fire
Department connections shall be readily accessible to emergency vehicles.
      (9)   Water and sewer. Water and sewer installations shall comply with
all city specifications and requirements.
      (10)   Signs. Permitted signs shall be allowed, in accordance with
Subchapter
155.12, and shall be located to avoid creating distractions, visual clutter and
obstructions for traffic entering or exiting a site.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.137 CONDITIONS.
   Conditions which are designed to ensure compliance with the intent of this
Code and other regulations of the City of Mt. Healthy may be imposed on site
plan approval.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.138 CHANGES TO AN APPROVED SITE PLAN.
   Changes to an approved site plan shall be permitted only under the following
circumstances:
   (A)   The holder of an approved site plan shall notify the Zoning
Administrator of any proposed change to an approved site plan.
   (B)   Changes to a Level "A" site plan may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (C)   Minor changes to a Level "B" site plan may be approved by the Zoning
Administrator upon determining that the proposed revision(s) will not alter the
basic design or any specified conditions imposed as part of the original
approval. Minor changes shall include the following:
      (1)   Reduction in building size or increase in building size up to 5% of
total approved floor area.
      (2)   Movement of buildings or other structures by no more than ten feet.
      (3)   Replacement of plant material specified in the landscape plan with
comparable materials of an equal or greater size.
      (4)   Changes in building materials to a comparable or higher quality.
      (5)   Changes in floor plans which do not alter the character of the use.
      (6)   Changes required or requested by the city or county, state, or
federal regulatory agency in order to conform to other laws or regulations.
   (D)   A proposed change to a Level "B" site plan, not determined by the
Zoning Administrator to be a minor change, shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission as a site plan amendment and shall be reviewed in the same manner as
the original application.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.139 EXPIRATION.
   Site plan approval shall expire 12 months after the date of approval, unless
substantial construction has been commenced and is continuing. The Zoning
Administrator, in the case of a Level "A" site plan, or the Planning
Commission, in the case of a Level "B" site plan, may grant one extension of up
to 12 additional months; provided the applicant requests, in writing, an
extension prior to the date of expiration of the site plan. The extension shall
be approved if the applicant presents reasonable evidence to the effect that
the development has encountered unforeseen difficulties beyond the control of
the applicant, and the project will proceed within the extension period. If the
above provisions are not fulfilled or the extension has expired prior to
construction, the site plan approval shall become null and void.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
155.14 LANDSCAPING
§ 155.141 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this subchapter to require landscaping to minimize the
adverse effects of certain outdoor activities upon their surroundings and to
improve the appearance of parking areas and street frontages within the
community. It is further intended to preserve and enhance the aesthetic
qualities, character, privacy, and land values of property within the City of
Mt. Healthy.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.142 GREENBELTS AND PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING.
   (A)   Greenbelts required. Greenbelts and landscaping shall be required in
the following situations, except for parking areas within the CBD, Central
Business District.
      (1)   Along the street frontage, between the right-of-way line and the
parking lot of any parking lot containing four or more spaces;
      (2)   Within any required parking setback area; and
      (3)   Within the interior of any parking lot containing ten spaces or
more.
   (B) Greenbelt standards for front setbacks. Greenbelts shall meet the
requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   At a minimum, a required greenbelt shall contain one canopy tree,
plus two additional canopy or understory trees for each 50 feet of road
frontage.
      (2)   Trees within a required greenbelt may be clustered to create more
visual impact and appeal, rather than uniformly spaced along the street.
      (3)   The minimum width of a required greenbelt shall correspond to the
parking setback requirements prescribed for the district, but shall not be less
than ten feet.
      (4)   Landscaping shall be located so it does not obstruct the vision of
drivers entering or leaving a site.
      (5)   Storm water detention/retention areas shall be permitted within
required greenbelts; provided, they shall not hamper the screening intent of
the greenbelt or jeopardize the survival of plants.
   (C)   Parking lot landscaping. Where landscaping is required within parking
lots, it shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   One tree for every ten parking spaces shall be planted within the
parking lot. Trees shall be canopy species. While drought tolerant native
species are preferred, other species may be planted within parking areas if
approved by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, as applicable.
      (2)   Parking lots shall contain landscape islands. Each island shall be
a minimum of ten feet wide, although islands may be combined to ensure a better
environment for tree and plant growth. Each island shall be planted with a
minimum of two trees to provide shade and to break up the visual monotony of
large paved parking lots. Trees shall be planted at least three feet from the
edge of the island to avoid contact with vehicles.
      (3)   Landscaping shall be arranged so as not to obscure traffic signs or
fire hydrants, or obstruct drivers' sight distance within the parking area and
at driveway entrances.
      (4)   All landscape areas shall be protected by raised curbs, parking
blocks or other similar methods to prevent damage. Notwithstanding this
requirement, alternative low impact design solutions shall be encouraged.
      (5)   Landscaping required for front yards which abut parking areas may
apply toward up to 50% of the required parking lot landscaping.
(Res. 21-1165, passed 7-20-21)
§ 155.143 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All required landscaping and greenbelts shall comply with the following
requirements, in addition to all other applicable requirements of this chapter:
   (A)   Minimum plant material standards.
      (1)   All plant materials shall be hardy, free of disease and insects,
and indigenous to Hamilton County.
      (2)   Artificial plant material shall not be used within any required
landscaped area. This shall not preclude the use of stone, shredded bark, wood
chips, lava rock or similar accent materials within planting beds.
      (3)   All plant material shall be installed in a manner that does not
alter drainage patterns on site or adjacent properties, or obstruct vision for
safety of ingress or egress.
      (4)   No substitution of plant species or sizes shall be allowed unless
approved by the Zoning Administrator in writing.
      (5)   All plant material shall be planted in a manner that will not cause
damage to utility lines (above and below ground) and public roadways.
      (6)   Existing plant material which complies with the standards and
intent of this chapter may be credited toward meeting the landscape
requirements.
      (7)   The overall landscape plan shall not contain more than 33% of any
one plant species.
      (8)   Plant material shall not be placed closer than four feet to any
fence or property line.
      (9)   Where trees are placed in two or more rows, planting shall be
staggered in rows.
   (B)   Minimum standards for berms.
      (1)   If berms are constructed, they shall be constructed to maintain a
side slope not to exceed a one foot rise to a three foot run ratio. When
topography or other site conditions prevent construction of berms at this
ratio, retaining walls or terracing may be permitted. If a berm is constructed
with a retaining wall or by terracing, the earthen slope shall face the
exterior of the site.
      (2)   Bermed areas not containing planting beds shall be covered with
grass or other living ground cover maintained in a healthy condition.
      (3)   Berms shall be constructed so drainage patterns on site or toward
adjacent properties will not be altered and vision will not be obstructed for
safety of ingress and egress.
      (4)   If berms are used for any part of a screen or greenbelt, all
required plant material shall be placed on the top and side slope facing the
exterior property line.
   (C)   Rain gardens. Rain gardens are encouraged as part of a site
development and may be approved within a required greenbelt. If provided, rain
gardens shall be prepared according to the following guidelines:
      (1)   The purpose of the rain garden is to absorb rain water and to
improve the attractiveness of the site.
      (2)   The size of the rain garden shall be appropriate for the soils
located on the site.
      (3)   Soils used in the rain garden shall be appropriately prepared and
amended following any compaction that may have occurred during construction.
      (4)   The rain garden shall be graded to assure that rain water entering
the garden will spread out over a large flat area and will soak into the soil.
      (5)   To minimize hazards to pedestrians, the rain garden shall be graded
so that at its deepest it is approximately six inches.
      (6)   The rain garden is planted with native perennial flowers, grasses
and sedges.
      (7)   The rain garden shall be maintained with minimal or no fertilizers;
no herbicides or pesticides will be used.

Appeals or City Council, as applicable, may require an applicant to deposit a
performance guarantee to ensure compliance with this Code, the completion of
improvements and to protect natural resources and the health, safety and
welfare of city residents and the future users or inhabitants of the project.
      (1)   A "performance guarantee" shall mean a cash deposit, certified
check, letter of credit or other legal surety approved by the city in an amount
equal to the estimated cost for any improvements to be made, as determined by
the applicant and confirmed and verified by a representative of the city.
      (2)   The performance guarantee shall be deposited with the city before
any building permits can be issued. The treasurer shall retain the performance
guarantee, in accordance with this section.
      (3)   When a performance guarantee is required as a condition of
approval, the approving body shall also specify when the related improvement
must be completed.
      (4)   As the project is constructed, the city may rebate money to the

at least 10% shall be retained for each related element until the entire
project has been satisfactorily completed. The city may solicit the opinion of
a civil engineer or other licensed professional in the State of Ohio to
determine the value of the completed work.
      (5)   Once a project has been satisfactorily completed, as determined by
the Zoning Administrator, and all the landscaping (if required) has been
established, the treasurer shall return any remaining funds to the applicant.
The city may retain up to 10% of the performance guarantee to cover any
administrative or consultant costs directly associated with reviewing and/or
inspecting any improvements.
      (6)   In the event an applicant does not make the improvements for which
the performance guarantee was required within the established time period, or
if improvements are not constructed in accordance with this Zoning Code and/or
any required conditions and attempts to attain compliance are unsuccessful, the
city may enter the subject property and complete the improvements using the
performance guarantee to cover costs.
      (7)   In the event an applicant does not make or complete the
improvements and the performance guarantee is insufficient to allow the city to
complete them, the applicant shall be required to pay the city an amount
necessary to complete the improvements, plus any administrative or legal fees.

Administrator does not believe that the mediation process is resolving or would
resolve the matter, he/she does not have to engage in or continue with
mediation.
         (b)   In addition to, or in lieu of the mediation procedure, the
Zoning Administrator may also send a certified letter to the property owner(s).

bring the property into compliance. The property address and parcel
identification number shall be referenced in the letter and any photos of the
violation as it existed on the date of investigation shall also be included.

the specified compliance date.

whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;

substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;

be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.

closer to conformity than it was prior to the change, shall to that extent
thereafter continue to be used or arranged for a conforming use or more

structure, and shall not revert to its prior nonconforming status, or to a less
conforming use or structure, at any time in the future.

to occupy a greater area of land or building than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code.
   (B)   No part of any nonconforming use shall be moved unless that movement
eliminates or reduces the nonconformity.
   (C)   If a nonconforming use is abandoned for any reason for a period of
more than one year, any subsequent use shall conform to the requirements of
this Code. A nonconforming use shall be determined to be abandoned if one or
more of the following conditions exists, which shall be deemed to constitute an

single-family detached dwelling, which is damaged by explosion, fire, flood,
wind or other Act of God to the extent of 50% or more of its replacement value
immediately prior to damage, shall not be reestablished except in conformance
with the requirements of this Zoning Code, unless an exception is granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with division (E) of this section. In

replacement value is not acceptable to the property owner or applicant for a
zoning permit to repair or reconstruct the building or structure, the applicant
may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (E)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a building containing a
nonconforming use to be enlarged, provided that the Board finds that all of the

the building.

of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (3)   The enlargement does not prevent the future use of the structure
for a conforming use.
      (4)   The enlargement is not detrimental to present and potential
surrounding uses, will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
this Zoning Code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the
city.
   (F)   A detached single-family residential dwelling that is nonconforming
because it is in a business, industrial or other district where it is now
disallowed shall be considered conditionally permitted, and it may be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered, provided that it meets the requirements for a
single-family dwelling in the C District. If the dwelling is damaged by
explosion, fire, flood, wind or other Act of God to the extent of 50% or more
of its replacement value immediately prior to damage, it may be reconstructed,
provided that no nonconformity is increased and no new nonconformity is
created.
   (G)   Any change to a nonconforming use may only be toward bringing the use
into conformance; however, a nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use provided all of the following determinations are made by the
Board of Zoning Appeals:
      (1)   The proposed use shall be as compatible, or more compatible, with
the surrounding
neighborhood than the previous nonconforming use, considering factors such as
hours of operation, traffic, noise and similar external impacts.
      (2)   The proposed nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased,
nor extended to occupy a greater area of land or building area than the
previous nonconforming use.
      (3)   That appropriate conditions and safeguards are provided that will
ensure compliance with the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.

continue to be occupied and used as long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)    Nononconforming building or structure may be enlarged or altered

requirements of this Code.

uses.

conformance, the head of the Building and Zoning Department determines that the

Building and Zoning Department shall issue a zoning certificate of non-
conformance, evidencing such facts and setting forth the nature and extent of

   (B)   If, as a result of the above inspection, the code official determines
that health code violations, housing code violations, hazards, or structural
defects exist on the property, the code official shall provide written notice

cost of abating the violations. The City Law Director shall collect the
priority lien from the proceeds of the judicial sale of the property, or upon
any subsequent sale of the property, or by the methods provided in R.C. §
715.261. When notice is given as provided for in this section, the lien shall
be a priority over liens of prior record and the lien will be effective on the
date the city incurs the costs of repairs as provided in R.C. § 715.26(B).
