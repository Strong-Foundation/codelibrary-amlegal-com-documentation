EDITOR'S NOTE
    The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

   (d)   Use of a Credit Card or Charge Account.
      (1)   Authorized Users. Authorized Users for the City Credit Card or
Charge Account are determined by department heads or card holders and approved
by the Auditor or their designee. The addition or elimination of any employee
for the use of the City Credit Card or Charge Account will be reported to the
Auditor or their designee as soon as possible.

limit the terms of use of a Credit Card or Charge Account with each Authorized

noted in Exhibit C.
      (4)   Lost or stolen cards. The authorized Credit Card user shall
immediately report the loss, theft, or possible unauthorized use of the card to
the Auditor or designee. The Auditor or authorized designee shall immediately
notify the issuer of the card to place a hold on the account.
      (5)   Issuance of card(s). Any card user shall sign the acknowledgment of
the Credit Card or Charge Account policy before use of the City Credit Card or
Charge Account.
         If Card is given to authorized user for travel, the Card shall be
returned to the head of their department, the Auditor or their designee by the

hereby levies an annual municipal income tax on income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   (1)    The annual tax is levied at a rate of 1% (one percent). The tax
is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving
income in the City. The tax is levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions
and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
191.03  and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)    The City also levies an annual tax at the following rates and for
the following purposes. For each, the tax is levied at a uniform rate on all
persons residing in or earning or receiving income in the City. The tax is
levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and on
net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
191.03  and other sections as they may apply.
         (a)    Eleven one-hundredths (11/100) of one percent to be used

tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with, the

         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred

Domicile.
   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the City for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the City on
the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax
Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the City
for all or part of the taxable year.
        (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is
domiciled in the City for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
         (b)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
         (c)    The address on the individual's driver's license;

         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the City.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact period" with
the City if the individual is away overnight from the individual's abode
located outside of the City and while away overnight from that abode spends at
least some portion, however minimal, of each of two consecutive days in the
City.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Businesses.
   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
City or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or telephone
company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745 of
the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
191.04  (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period
from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
191.12  (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
191.12  (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)    The employer;
            (ii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
            (Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets any of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within the City to
purchasers outside the City, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
         (Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
      (8)    Job Creation Tax Credit. The City, by ordinance and pursuant to
authority granted in ORC 718.15, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the City. If
a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the new income tax revenue the City derives from new employees of the taxpayer
and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years. Before the City passes an
ordinance granting a credit, the City and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
         (Ord. 2018-22. Passed 4-24-18.)
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
191.04 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
191.04 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 2023-79. Passed 11-14-23.)
191.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
191.03  or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
191.03  of this chapter, of 2% (two percent). An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
            Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month
for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
            (Ord. 2018-35. Passed 6-12-18.)
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
the City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.
   (C)   (1)    As used in this division:
                 (a)    "Employer" includes a person that is a related member
to or of an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.

         (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
191.04 .
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that

      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,

services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

due date of City’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual
shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable
year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this
division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a
City income tax return. The extended due date of the City income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this

municipal income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section,
the tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the
taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the

corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.

require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within the
City,
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section 191.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the City,
unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the City and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents. (Ord. 2018-35. Passed 6-12-18.)

Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this

section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active

defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section

Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to

the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code

Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.02 , by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
191.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05 , include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
191.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
191.05  by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other
municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality or the
rate of one percent (1%).
   (B)    The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under
Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
191.05  or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section. (Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year. (Ord. 2018-35.
Passed 6-12-18.)
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.18  upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
191.05  for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
191.18 .
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.21 .
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.18  (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.11 AMENDED RETURNS. 
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
191.12  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
191.09 .
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, that taxpayer shall
make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City income tax
based upon such final determination of federal or state tax liability. The
taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars .
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.21 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
191.09 .
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
191.09 , with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
191.09 .
   (E)    No civil action to recover City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-91. Passed 11-24-15.)
191.18 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Applicable law" means this chapter, the resolutions, ordinances,

accordance with division (A)(2) of this section.
      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,

191.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.

   (A)     Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
191.03 ;
      (7)   (a)    Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
191.04 .

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.18 , in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
191.99 .
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
191.19  within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
191.18 .
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99  for a violation of Section
191.17  and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

subject to appeal.

members shall be appointed by City Council, but such appointees may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the City at any time during
their term or in the five years (which applies only to these two appointments)
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the Mayor of the City. This member may be an employee of the City, but may not
be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the City Board of Tax Review shall be two
years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve if the
member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed
by the Mayor of the City shall serve at the discretion of the administrative
official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

   (e)    Consolidated Returns.
      (1)    A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for Federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)    Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,

representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in
part.
      (1)    Where the gross monthly rentals of any real properties, regardless
of number and value aggregates in excess of three hundred dollars ($300.00) per
month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management
or operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer and the
net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax; provided that in
case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity where the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating
percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month; provided
further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when the rental

month; and provided further that the person who operates a rooming house of
five or more rented rooms shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month.

consideration only real estate situated within the City.
      (8)    To be considered nontaxable as ground rentals, the property must
be under perpetual leasehold by the term of which the lessor performs no
services of any type, including taxes on the property.
      (9)    Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on
that portion of income derived from property located in the City.
      (10)    A taxpayer may aggregate rentals for a net rental income, but no
net loss may be taken against other income nor may it be carried either forward
or backward.
      (11)    The residents of the City are subject to taxation upon net income
from rentals (to the extent above specified) on all properties located in the
City, and/or on all properties located outside the City, with credit being
given for income tax or taxes paid to other municipalities on rental profits on
properties in those municipalities, but with said credit not to exceed the
total rate levied in this chapter. Non-residents of the City are subject to
such taxation only if the real property is situated within the City.
   (g)    In no case may a taxpayer deduct business losses or rental losses
against wages or other compensation earned as an employee.

hereunder.
      (11)    In the event any association or organization receives taxable

191.05A RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and
file a return on or before April 15th of each year for the previous year. When
the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day
of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal year or period. The
Auditor is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an
employer or employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said
employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation, and other taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by
him or them to the Auditor may be accepted as the return required of a
nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Chapter, is
such qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable
income.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
city return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Auditor on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Auditor; or on a generic form,
if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of the information
required to be submitted with the Municipality's prescribed return and, if the
taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with all
provisions of this Chapter and all applicable rules and regulations governing
the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this Chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the
Auditor may require, including a statement that the figures used in the return
are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only such
income as is taxable under the provisions of this Chapter.
   (e)   An extension for the filing of a Municipal Income Tax Return may be
granted providing:
      (1)   The taxpayer has requested a an extension for filing a federal
income tax return, and files a copy of such extension request with the
Municipality's Income Tax Department. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return. If the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Auditor may deny a taxpayer's request for extension if the
taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request; or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
191.10A. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of this Chapter have been met. Any extension by
the Auditor shall be granted upon the condition that declaration filing and
payment requirements have been filled; however, if, upon further examination it
then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment requirements have not
been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in full and in the same
manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Auditor the amount of taxes shown as due. However, credit
shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.06A; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07A; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
191.14A for tax paid to another municipality.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
191.14A of this Chapter, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Chapter may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one
dollar ($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income, and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
191.05 and
191.10. The Auditor shall provide by regulation the format in which such
amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and
pay an additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Auditor, or his authorized representative, to file the
items required by this paragraph.
(Ord. 2003-105. Passed 11-25-03.)
191.06A COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rates provided in Sections
191.03A,
191.03.1A and
191.03.2A hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month
following such withholding make a return and pay to the Auditor the amount of
taxes so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Auditor and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Auditor. Such employer shall be liable for the payment of the
tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have, in
fact, been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Auditor. The
Auditor may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever the
Auditor has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal
shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (g)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with personally liable for the tax not returned or
paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and penalties, and are
also liable under the provisions of Section
191.12A hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (j)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.

a return that omits gross income in excess of twenty-five per cent (25%) of

with intent to evade the tax, or in the case of failure to file a return. In
those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have

income or wages, the credit described in Division (c) above shall be calculated
using the tax rate in effect.

return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed, whichever is
later. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no
amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before
the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any
extension of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the
rate of interest prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (e)   Amounts of less than One Dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or

R.C. 5739.08(B) a tax of three percent (3%) on all rents received by a hotel
for lodging furnished to transient guests with the revenue therefrom to be
applied as follows:
      (1)   Fifty percent (50%) deposited in the General Fund and appropriated
for any lawful purpose; and
      (2)    The balance of the revenue shall be deposited in a separate fund,
which shall be spent solely to make contributions/dues to a convention and
visitor's bureau(s) operating within Crawford County.
   (b)   This tax is hereby referred to as the "transient occupancy tax" as
imposed by and to be collected and administered under this chapter.
   (c)    This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
   (d)   If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel, the Treasurer may require that the tax be paid directly to the
Treasurer.
(Ord. 2016-7. Passed 2-9-16.)

      (3)    Upon rents of five dollars ($5.00) a day or less.
   (b)    No exemption claimed under subsections (a)(1) or (2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected, and,
under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Treasurer. All claims
of exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be made in the manner
prescribed by the Treasurer. (Ord. 2007-47. Passed 6-26-07.)
195.04 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.

charged and received, and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies
during the preceding calendar month. All claims for exemption from the tax

manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his

make application in writing to the Treasurer for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing is not made within
the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the
Treasurer, shall become final and conclusive, and immediately due and payable.
If an application is made, the Treasurer shall give not less than five days'
written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at
a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should
not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties
should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Treasurer shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of the tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval
fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio
R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the
towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice required under
Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either
of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Mayor may designate such street or highway, or portion thereof, not to be a
through highway and thereafter the affected residence district shall be
indicated by official traffic control devices in accordance with Chapter
305. Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   The Mayor may designate additional through streets or highways and
shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals at all streets
and highways intersecting such through streets or highways, or may designate
any intersection as a stop or yield intersection and shall erect like signs at
one or more entrances to such intersection in accordance with Chapter
305.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

are responding to emergency calls and are equipped with and displaying at least
one flashing, rotating or oscillating light visible under normal atmospheric
conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of the vehicle and when the

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of subsection (A) of
Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or any combination of two or more violations of subsection
(A) of Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section.
(ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 SPECIAL CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
   (a)   The Mayor may, if he deems it advisable and necessary, appoint the
Building Inspector and/or any other designee as Special Code Enforcement
Officers of the City of Galion for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of
Sections
303.10,
521.04 ,

1339 of the Galion Codified Ordinances, Ordinance No. 87-5636, as amended, and
Resolution No. 57 of the Galion City Board of Health. (A.O.)
   (b)    The Building Inspector or designee shall have and possess all the
requisite powers with respect to the issuance of citations for minor
misdemeanor violations and shall continue in such capacity as Code Enforcement
Officers until such appointment is terminated by action of the Mayor. No such
Special Code Enforcement Officer shall receive any compensation other than that
compensation as may be provided for in the regular position of employment for
such person.
   
   (c)   Any citation issued by any person authorized by this section shall be
in writing on an appropriate form, contain the name and address of the
defendant, describe the offense charged, refer to the numerical designation of
the applicable statute or ordinance, state the name of the officer who issued
the citation, and order the defendant to appear at a stated time and place.
   (d)   Citations issued for violations involving real property shall be
served on the owner, occupant or agent either in person or by certified mail to
the offending location or the tax mailing address as indicated by the Crawford
County Treasurer.
   (e)   Citations shall inform the defendant that, in lieu of appearing at the
time and place stated, he may, within that stated time, appear personally at
the office of the Clerk of Court and upon signing a plea of guilty and a waiver
of trial pay a stated fine and court costs, if any. The citation shall inform
the defendant that, in lieu of appearing at the time and place stated, he may,
within the stated time, sign the guilty plea and waiver of trial provision of
the citation, and mail the citation and money order for the total amount of the
fine and costs to the Office of the Clerk of Court. The citation shall inform
the defendant that he may be arrested if he fails to appear at the Clerk's
office or at the time and place stated in the citation.

commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

515.06 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
180 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to
have committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and
such other information as may be required by the Board. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate compliance on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the
Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds under which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board. (Ord. 89-5782. Passed 11-7-89.)
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent of his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons
so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
Executive Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the review, and if the Board determines upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated its chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law Director
in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to
prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City of Galion before a court of competent jurisdiction.
In any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a
violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and,
where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may
also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.

535.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, the Council of the City of Galion makes the
following statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of this City in order to protect and preserve the
health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the
businesses as well as the citizens of this City.
      (2)   The Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of this City that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by this City in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by this City are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   The Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects
by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner, and
by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the Council seeks to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens
from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of
urban blight.
      (7)   The Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of this City and that expanded regulation of adult
entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of the Council in enacting this act to
suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of this Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and this Council recognizes that state and
federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and
encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes
against any such illegal activities in this state.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Council in enacting this chapter to regulate
in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of this City
and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary
effects of adult entertainment establishments within this City. The provisions
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of this Council in enacting
this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize the restrictions of denial of,
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of, access by the distributors
and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Council in enacting this
chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene
material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

136 Cong. Rec. S. 8987; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 14519; 135 Cong. Rec. S. 5636, 134
Cong. Rec. E. 3750; and also on findings from the paper entitled "Stripclubs
According to Strippers; Exposing Workplace Sexual Violence," by Kelly
Holsopple, Program Director, Freedom and Justice Center for Prostitution
Resources, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and from "Sexually Oriented Businesses: An
Insider's View," by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan House Committee on
Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and from various other police
reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other documentary evidence), and
subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of Grand Rapids, Michigan
Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F. 3d 291; 729, Inc. v. Kenton
County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F. 3d 485; and Andy's Rest. & Lounge,
Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F. 3d 550, and the Council's
independent review of the same) the Council finds:
   (1)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including,
but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential
spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit drug use and drug
trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter,
and sexual assault and exploitation.
   (2)   Illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity, including lewd conduct,
masturbation, oral and anal sex, occur at unregulated sexually oriented
businesses, including those businesses which provide private or semi-private
rooms, booths, or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live performances.
   (3)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which this City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is this City's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, this City's interest in regulating sexually oriented
businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or
future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in this City. The City
finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (4)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City.

of this chapter shall constitute a public nuisance and shall be subject to
civil abatement proceedings initiated by the City in a court of competent

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the

or allow the making of any noise or sound which exceeds the limits set forth in
this Chapter for the use occupancy. (Ord. 2000-83. Passed 11-28-00.)
565.04 MEASUREMENT OF SOUND.
   (a)    The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with the City’s sound
level meter which shall meet the standards prescribed by the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI). The instrument shall be maintained in calibration
and good working order. A calibration check shall be made of the system at the
time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to
provide a proper representation of the noise source. The microphone during
measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement
or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be
used at all times. Traffic, aircraft and other transportation noise sources and
other noises shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such
background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured. If the
background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured, the primary
noise being measured shall be limited to a level which is the greater of either
the Table I value, or where combined with the ambient sound, a level which is
two (2) decibels above the level of the ambient sound level measurement alone.
   (b)   The slow meter response of the City's sound level meter shall be used
in order to best determine that the average level has not exceeded the limits
set forth for the use occupancy category in Table I below. A sound level meter
with a level averaging circuit may be used.
   (c)    The measurement shall be made at or up to fifty (50) feet beyond the
property line of the property on which such noise is generated. In the event of
a complaint, the measurement shall be made at or up to fifty (50) feet beyond
the property line of the property on which such noise is generated in the
direction of the complainant location. Any measurement shall be at least two
(2) minutes in duration.
   (d)    In the case of an elevated or directional sound or noise source,
compliance with the noise limits shall be maintained at any elevation at the
boundary.
   (e)    The ambient sound level measurement shall be measured at the same
location along the property line utilized in Section
565.04(c), while the primary noise being measured is inoperative. If the
primary noise being measured cannot be turned off, is not turned off or if
additional sound is created to distort the ambient sound level measurement, the
ambient sound level measurement will be estimated by performing a measurement
in the same general area of the noise being measured. (Ord. 2000-83. Passed 11-
28-00.)
565.05 CLASSIFICATION OF USE OCCUPANCIES.
    For purposes of defining "use occupancies," all premises zoned as a
residential category shall be considered residential use. All premises
containing transient commercial sleeping quarters legally permitted shall be
considered tourist use. All premises containing business where sales,
professional, or other commercial use is legally permitted shall be considered
commercial use. All premises where manufacturing is legally permitted shall be
considered manufacturing use. Hospitals, nursing homes, schools, libraries, and
church uses shall be considered residential uses. In other cases of multiple
use zones, the more restrictive zoned use category shall prevail. Any area not
otherwise classified shall conform to commercial standards.
(Ord. 2000-83. Passed 11-28-00.)
565.06 MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE SOUND LEVELS BY USE OCCUPANCY.
   No person shall operate or cause to be operated any source of sound from any
use occupancy in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the
limits set forth in the use occupancy category in Table I.

a bona fide condition; and
            (2)    That there exists no less discriminatory means of satisfying
the bona fide requirement.

a necessary result of such a bona fide condition; and that there exists no less
discriminatory means of satisfying the bona fide condition.

of particular installations where compliance with the foregoing distance
requirements may be a handicap to the use of the property and where no undue
hazard will be created, the distance may be reduced at the discretion of
Council after due consideration of such special features as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the adjoining
property, proximity of storage tanks, degree of fire protection provided and
the facilities available at fire departments to cope with controlling liquid
fires. The above features are not to be in any way construed as a limitation on

gas, or until the well is pulled and plugged as hereinafter provided. These
insurance policies and the coverages thereunder must be to the complete
satisfaction of the City and the policies may be rejected by the City for any
valid reason. Rejection of the insurance policies shall serve to stay the

Director. If any portion of the job of restoring property to proper condition
is considered inadequate, Council may, on notice to the permittee of the

other things necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.
 
   (b)   Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be grounds
to refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be grounds to revoke a permit
already issued. Revocation of a permit shall remove all right of the permittee
to drill for oil and/or gas until such time as the permittee takes steps to be
in compliance with this chapter. Operations carried on by the permittee after
revocation of his permit shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall
be punishable as provided in Section

person, persons or corporation as to property within the City from fire, over
and above the insurance collected thereon, or from oil, gas or water caused by
or originating from the operation connected with the well, and will hold the
City free and harmless from any and all liability growing out of the granting
of such a permit.
(Ord. 3797. Passed 3-3-64.)

existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            (ii)   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            (iii)   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            (iv)   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            (v)   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City right of way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            (vi)   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing wireless support structure located within the City right of way. If no
such existing wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            (vii)   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
new wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
            (viii)   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
new wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference
            (ix)   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City right of way.
         B.   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least 500
feet from any existing small cell facility.

               a.   Material - The enclosure material shall be metal, a
composite, or an equivalent material as determined by the Safety-Service
Director.
               b.   Color - The enclosure shall match the color of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               c.   Style - The enclosure shall match the style of the pole on
which it is mounted.
               d.   Coordinated Design Elements - Common enclosures shall match
the material, color, and style of nearby existing common enclosures when:
                  1.   Such enclosures are located within 5000 feet of an
existing common enclosure; and
                  2.   Such enclosures are mounted on wireless support
structures of a similar or matching design.
               e.   Exception - If the aesthetics and character of the
immediate area would be better matched by an enclosure of a different material,
color, style, or by deviating from the design of a nearby existing common
enclosure as determined by the Safety-Service Director, then such design
elements may be substituted with an alternate design element. Such
determination shall be based on the following factors:
                  1.   The design features of nearby poles serving in a similar
capacity;
                  2.   The design features of the existing or proposed
streetscape, district, or site;
                  3.   The historical context of a district or specific site;
                  4.   A desire to camouflage or conceal the enclosure from
view.
            (vi)   All ground mounted equipment shall be placed in an
underground vault. No above grade ground mounted equipment in service of a
small cell facility is permitted unless the following conditions can be
satisfied as determined by the Safety-Service Director:
               a.   The applicant has submitted clear and convincing evidence
that the equipment cannot feasibly be pole-mounted, placed in an underground
vault, or hidden within or integrated into an existing streetscape element
(i.e. - bus stop shelter). Increased costs alone shall not be a consideration.
If a ground mounted enclosure is approved, the Safety-Service Director shall
reserve the right to require any of the following conditions:
                  1.   Concealed Enclosure - All equipment shall be completely
concealed within a metal, composite, or equivalent material enclosure as
determined by the Safety-Service Director.
                  2.   Smallest Size - The enclosure shall be no larger than
necessary based on the smallest available size of the proposed equipment as
determined by the Safety-Service Director.
                  3.   Camouflage - Camouflaging elements may be required. Such
elements may include, but shall not be limited to, public art displayed on the
enclosure, strategic placement in less visible or obtrusive locations,
placement within an existing streetscape element, landscape screening, and
strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
               b.   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be thirty
inches.
   (c)   Reservation of Right of Way. The City reserves the right to reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the right of way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the City in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the City's pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.
(Ord. 2018-27. Passed 5-22-18.)
   731.06 NONCONFORMITY.

of the small cell facility and/or wireless support structure's replacement
cost;
      (3)   The nonconforming small cell facility and/or wireless support
structure is abandoned. (Ord. 2018-27. Passed 5-22-18.)
   731.07 CONFLICT WITH OTHER PROVISIONS.
   In the event that any other applicable law or code requires any more
restrictive requirements, the most restrictive requirement shall control.
(Ord. 2018-27. Passed 5-22-18.)
   731.08 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of any part of this chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to any person
or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 2018-27. Passed 5-22-18.)
   731.99 PENALTY.

741.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting this chapter, the Council of the City of Galion makes the
following statement of intent and findings:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from
the public safety agencies of this City in order to protect and preserve the
health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees of the
businesses as well as the citizens of this City.
      (2)   The Council finds that adult entertainment establishments are
frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution and
sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of this City that demands reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by this City in the specified manner, and expanded
authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by
local governments, in order to protect the health and well-being of the
citizens.
      (4)   Minimal regulations enacted by this City are a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
      (6)   The Council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects
by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner, and
by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the Council seeks to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry; protect the citizens
from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property
values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the spread of
urban blight.
      (7)   The Council has determined that current local zoning and other
locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general
welfare of the people of this City and that expanded regulation of adult
entertainment establishments is necessary.
      (8)   It is not the intent of the Council in enacting this chapter to
suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral regulations that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
      (9)   It is not the intent of this Council to condone or legitimize the
distribution of obscene material, and this Council recognizes that state and
federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and
encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes
against any such illegal activities in this State.
   (b)   It is the intent of this Council in enacting this chapter to regulate
in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote
the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of this City
and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary
effects of adult entertainment establishments within this City. The provisions
of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of this Council in enacting
this chapter to restrict or deny, or authorize the restrictions or denial of,
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of, access by the distributors
and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended
market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Council in enacting this
chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene
material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings
under Section 3 of House Bill 23 (and on findings incorporated in the cases of

subsequent findings in Sensations, Inc. v. City of Grand Rapids, Michigan
Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F. 3d 291; 729, Inc. v. Kenton
County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F. 3d 485; and Andy's Rest. & Lounge,
Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F. 3d 550, and the Council's
independent review of the same the Council of the City of Galion finds:
      (1)   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments.
      (2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined
in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
      (3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Ohio R.C. 2907.25.
      (4)   Offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
      (5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other
adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
      (6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections,
chlamydial, myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and
chancroid.
      (7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing
cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983,
4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
      (8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of
January 1999. Ohio has required HIV reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the State.
      (9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing
cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in
Ohio.
      (10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the
United States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982,
and 45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
      (11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported
annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being
reported in 1990.
      (12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986 has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
      (13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
      (14)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
      (15)   The findings noted in subsection (c)(1) to (14) hereof raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (16)   Adult entertainment establishments have operational
characteristics that require or mandate subject them to reasonable government
regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns.
      (17)   The enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this City.

Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors relating
to the Service Provider's Occupancy or Use of the Right-of-Way, whether such
acts or omissions are authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Chapter. A

the City and its elected and appointed officers, officials, employees, agents,
representatives and subcontractors harmless from their own negligence.
   
   (c)   Performance Bond. As a condition of consent to Occupy or Use the

Service Provider so long as any of the Service Provider's Facilities are
located within the City's Right-of-Way.

against the Performance Bond or letter of credit or other instrument made by,
or paid to, the City.
            (3)    Any draw upon the Performance Bond or letter of credit to
recover the City's costs related to a Service Provider's use of the Right-of-
Way shall be considered Public Way Fees as that term is defined in this Chapter

   (a)   Customer bills are calculated and mailed on the third (3rd) business
day of the month to the service location or to the mailing address currently on
file with the City Utility Department. The due date for customer payment is the
twenty-first (21st) day of the month, which due date appears on the customer's
bill. Failure of a customer to receive a bill for utility services does not
relieve the customer from responsibility for prompt payment.
   (b)   Bills for utility services not paid in full by the due date shall be
considered delinquent and shall be subject to a late fee of zero percent (0%)
of the entire bill.
   (c)   Customer payments must be received in house by the City of Galion
Utility Department located at 115 Harding Way East or by an authorized agent or
depository by 4:00 p.m., local time, on the due date, or the payment is
delinquent. Postmarked dates, check dates, or items placed in the drop box
after close of business on the date due will not be used as the basis for
determining timely payment.
   (d)   Return Payment / NSF Fee for any utility payment is thirty dollars
($30.00) per occurrence. (Ord. 2020-23. Passed 4-14-20.)
   919.02 APPLICATIONS FOR UTILITY SERVICES.
   (a)   Applications for utility service shall be made in person at the City
of Galion Utility Office at 115 Harding Way East, Galion, Ohio 44833. An
applicant must provide the following information and sign an Agreement for
Utility Services:

   (c)   Grounds for denial of an application include, but not limited to the
following:
      (1)   The premises require specific repairs or changes, such as
additional water taps and electric lines, before utility service can be safely
provided.
      (2)   An applicant or his/her roommate owes the City on an outstanding
utility bill for an account in his/her own name or for an account at a previous
residence where the individual lived.
      (3)   The applicant provides false information or intentionally opens
various accounts under different names in an attempt to trick or deceive the
City to provide utility services.
      (4)    The property owner is not in good standing on an account at the
location.
         (Ord. 2020-23. Passed 4-14-20.)
   919.03  TERMINATION OF UTILITY SERVICE.
   (a)   Upon a bill becoming delinquent, a fourteen (14) day Notice of
Intended Termination of Service shall be sent by mail to the service address
and/or the customer mailing address, if different. If the customer is a tenant,
a copy of said Notice shall also be sent by mail to the owner of the premises.
Such Notice shall indicate that the service is being terminated for nonpayment,
the date after which service will be terminated, and the appeal rights afforded
to any person affected by the Termination Notice by which such person may
contest such termination.
   (b)   The customer and/or the property owner may appeal the decision to
terminate service or to deny an application for service to the Safety-Service
Director and/or his/her designee by contacting the City of Galion Municipal
Utilities Office at least one full business day before the date stated on the
Notice of Intended Termination as the termination date. The appeal rights of
the customer and/or the property owner shall consist of a face-to-face meeting
with the Safety-Service Director and/or his/her designee, or if the appellant
prefers, a telephone meeting at which the matter shall be discussed. Persons
exercising these appeal rights shall be entitled to reasonable access to City
records concerning the affected service address and may request copies of such
documents at the requestor's copy expense.
   (c)   The Safety Service Director and/or his/her designee is empowered, when
good cause is shown, to compromise or adjust bills, to negotiate and compromise
payment disputes, to enter into payment plans as authorized below, and to
cancel or postpone termination of service. An appeal on a decision to terminate
service shall cause such termination to be stayed until the appeal has been
determined. If that determination upholds the initial decision to terminate,
the person appealing shall be provided with a new termination date to which no
appeal rights shall apply.
   (d)   The consumer of the utilities is responsible for the payment of the
utility bills; however, the property owner must notify the city when the rental
unit becomes vacant. Failure to do so may result in the property owner being
liable for utility bills incurred during the vacancy. The property owner may
transfer utility bills to their name at any time without a required deposit
provided they are currently in good financial standing with the City.
(Ord. 2020-23. Passed 4-14-20.)
   919.04  PAYMENT PLANS.
   (a)   The Safety Service Director and/or his/her designee is hereby granted
authority to offer and accept payment plans to Galion utility customers for
delinquent accounts under the following conditions:
      (1)   No payment plans shall be extended to persons who have previously
defaulted on a payment plan or have attempted to commit fraud against the City
Utility Department.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will payment arrangements be made extending
beyond a six (6) month period.
      (3)   There will be three types of "Utility Payment Extension /
Arrangements" that the Safety - Service Director and/or his/her designee can
consider and approve if sufficient grounds exist:
         A.   The "medical payment extension" may be an extension of up to
thirty (30) calendar days after the due date without late fees being assessed
on the customer account. Proof of the medical condition, on the form provided,
is required from a medical doctor or health care provider stating why said
medical condition warrants extension of payment due.
         B.   The "financial hardship" agreement may extend the time to pay
without late fees for up to one hundred eighty (180) calendar days with one-
sixth (1/6) of the delinquent balance plus the current bill being paid by the
current month's due date. Proof of financial hardship must be presented to the
Safety-Service Director.
         C.   The "monthly check" arrangement is to assist customers dependent
on monthly checks. The purpose of this agreement is to bring customer accounts
to a current status. To extend the payment due date until the 1st, 2nd or 3rd
day of the next month, the customer must agree to pay the delinquent month's
balance and one-half (1/2) of the current month's bill on the agreed date. The
customer must agree to pay the second half (1/2) of the outstanding bill plus
the next month's entire bill during the following month.
   (b)   The following procedures will be followed when extending a "Utility
Payment Extension / Arrangement:"
       (1)    Customer is allowed one agreement in a 12-month period.
      (2)    The one agreement is allowed per customer- not per service
location.
      (3)    Customer should be made aware that there will be no further
deferment or extension on the agreed payment date.
      (4)    Receipt of an NSF payment on an arrangement, missing a payment
date or paying less than the arrangement agreement amount is considered a
"broken" arrangement, and service will be disconnected without further
notification.
      (5)    In considering the feasibility of a payment arrangement, the
Safety - Service Director and/or his/her designee will analyze the customer's
history and amount of past payments to see if extension is a rational solution.

(Ord. 86-5562. Passed 8-19-86.)
921.13 SURCHARGE FOR EXCESSIVE WATER USAGE.
   (a)   It is the policy of the City to charge a surcharge to any person, firm
or corporation using more than the amount of water allowed under the terms of
this section during any period or periods when the Mayor determines in his
discretion that a water emergency exists by reason of insufficient or
inadequate water supply or pressure exists to provide safe and adequate water
service to the City or any portions thereof, after voluntary requests to reduce
water consumption or prohibition of non-essential water use have failed to
eliminate or appreciably reduce the problem or appear to an inadequate response
to a severe water problem, if such voluntary request or prohibition is possible
in view of the extent of water supply or pressure.
 
   (b)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to declare a water emergency to exist
when a shortage of water available for the customers in the City or
insufficient pressure exists within the public water supply system upon
adoption of an approving resolution by Council. Upon the declaration of such
emergency by the Mayor, he is authorized to place into effect the provisions of
this section until such time as the Mayor or Council determines that the
emergency is terminated.
 
   (c)   During any period or periods of water emergency as declared to exist
pursuant to the terms of this section, each water customer shall be allowed an
amount of water per month calculated as follows:
      (1)   Residential customers using over 300 cubic feet per month: Eighty
percent (80%) of the water used by the customer during the same month of the
preceding year when such water emergency was not in effect. In the event that
the customer was not a customer of the Galion water supply during the same
month of the preceding year, then quantity allowed shall be calculated upon the
basis of 700 cubic feet.
      (2)   Multiple family buildings served by one meter: The total allowed
for all persons served by the meter shall be eighty percent (80%) of the water
flow through the meter during the same month of the preceding year when such
water emergency was not in effect.
      (3)   Business and industries. The amounts allowed shall be eighty
percent (80%) of the amount used by the same business or industry in the same
month of the preceding year. This requirement shall not apply to any business
which established to the satisfaction of the Mayor that it has experienced a
substantial change affecting water usage since the month used as a basis of
measurement of year earlier, in which case the amount allowed shall be
determined by the Mayor taking into account the nature and extent of such
changes.
   (d)   In addition to the amount due under the water rates in effect for
water consumed, the following surcharges shall be charged for any water used by
any customer over the amounts allowed by this section: The amount of ten
dollars ($10.00) for the first 100 cubic feet; fifteen dollars ($15.00) for the
second 100 cubic feet; and twenty dollars ($20.00) for each 100 cubic feet over
the initial 200 cubic feet subject to the surcharge. Fractional amounts of less
than 100 cubic feet shall be prorated.
 
   (e)   In the event that the situation of any water customer is such that the
amount of water allowed for the customer pursuant to the terms of this section
without the imposition of the surcharge is unreasonable due to unusual or
extenuating circumstances, then the customer may appeal the surcharge placed
upon any monthly bill to the Council Water Review Committee, such committee
shall consist of the three members of the Laws and Ordinances Committee and an
alternate appointed by the Laws and Ordinances Committee, plus three citizens
appointed by the Mayor, and shall serve upon all surcharge appeals filed during
any water emergency. An appeal shall be filed by a water customer by mailing or
delivering a letter requesting an appeal to the Committee at the City Building
301 Harding Way East, Galion, Ohio 44833. Upon receipt of the notice of the
appeal, the Water Review Committee shall notify the water customer of the time
and place for a hearing upon such appeal. Following the hearing, the Committee
shall either approve the original surcharge or make such adjustment as it
determines to be reasonable under the circumstances. The filing of such appeal
by the water customer shall not excuse the payment of such penalty surcharge
when due as initially billed, and in the event that the Water Review Committee
makes an adjustment, then a credit shall appear on the next water bill of the
customer after such decision has been made.
 
   (f)   After deducting all costs attributable to administering and collecting
the surcharges provided for in this section, the balance of moneys collected
shall be placed in a special water fund to be spent solely for the
investigation and implementation of methods and measures intended to increase
the capacity of the public water supply and the continued availability of water
services to the customers of the system.
 
   (g)   The amount of the surcharge shall be added to the customer's monthly
water bill until paid, and if not promptly paid when due, the City of Galion
may proceed with the termination or shut-off of such customer's water service
pursuant to existing provisions relating thereto or the Law Director may file a
court action to collect any surcharge provided for and imposed in accordance
with this section.
 
   (h)   The Mayor shall provide public information at the time the provisions
of this section are imposed and in effect, including the following: press
releases to all local news media, public service announcements offered to
radio, television and cable television stations, and pamphlets or flyers
included with water bills or otherwise delivered to water customers.

921.14 AVAILABILITY OF CITY WATER TO PROPERTIES OUTSIDE CITY CORPORATION
LIMITS.
   (a)   It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City that no person,
property owner, corporation, entity, association, or organization, including
land subdividers or developers or agents thereof, subject to the exceptions
outlined in subsections (c) and (d) below, shall be permitted to connect to or
extend in any manner, any City water line unless the property benefitting from
such connection or extension is first annexed into the City.
 
   (b)   Any property located outside of the City corporation limits that is
presently being provided with City water service shall be exempt from such
policy and shall be entitled to continue receiving such service upon the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   The use of such water at said premises shall be subject to all City
ordinances and regulations relating thereto, including without limitation, all
regulations pertaining to backflow prevention.
      (2)   Each existing tap shall serve only one principal structure on a lot
or parcel of real property, and no taps into an existing tap or service line
shall be permitted. Laterals may not be extended from one property to another.
      (3)   The cost of maintaining, repairing and replacing any existing
service line from the point of tapping into the City water line to the premises
served by such line shall be at the sole cost of the property owner.
      (4)   The rate for water service provided to customers outside the City
corporation limits shall be the basic rate charged to customers located within
the corporation limits, plus a surcharge of fifty percent (50%) for usage
reflected in the July 2002 billing cycle and thereafter; provided, however, the
City has and reserves a right to change from time to time both the basic rate
and surcharge to be assessed and collected from all water customers located
outside its City corporation limits.
      (5)   The City does not represent or warrant that at all times there will
be a sufficient supply of water to meet the needs of water customers located
outside its corporation limits nor that there will always be adequate pressure
in its water lines.
 
   (c)   An exception to the policy adopted in paragraph (a) above which
requires annexation before City water will be provided outside the corporation
limits is granted if there is an agreement between Galion City Council, the
Board of County Commissioners having jurisdiction of the territory where such
water service may be provided, and the owner(s) of all property(ies) to receive
such water service. Said agreement shall require said property owner(s) to file
or join in an application with the appropriate County Commissioners to have
such property(ies) annexed to the City of Galion as soon as such process can be
commenced and to diligently pursue such proceedings to conclusion, and shall
require that the Board of Township Trustees having jurisdiction over the
subject property(ies) also adopt a resolution agreeing not to object to such
annexation of the property(ies) to the City of Galion.
   
   (d)   An exception to the policy adopted in paragraph (a) above which
requires annexation before City water will be provided outside the corporation
limits is granted to any person, property owner, corporation, entity,
association, or organization including land subdividers or developers or agents
thereof in control of a parcel of property outside the corporate limits which
is used for residential purposes and is further one through which or is
immediately adjacent to a parcel through which runs an existing water line.
Such a parcel may be connected to said existing line subject to the provisions
of subsections (b) (1) through (5) above. All costs of said connection shall be
borne by the property owner. This exception to the standard policy disallowing
connections outside of the corporate limits shall be in effect only as long as
said parcel continues in residential use.
(Ord. 2015-95. Passed 11-10-15.)
921.15 ATTACHMENT TO FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (a)   Due to the possibility of dangerous backflow, no person, firm,
corporation, or governmental entity shall attach to or withdraw water from a
fire hydrant connected to the Galion Water System, or authorize anyone to
withdraw water from a fire hydrant connected to the Galion Water System, except
as permitted in this section.
 
   (b)   Provided proper training in their use and understanding the hazards
associated with incorrect operation have been demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Mayor or his designated representative, there are five (5) User Types
permitted to operate a fire hydrant connected to the Galion Water System and to
withdraw water therefrom, subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   User Type 1. This User Type consists of the Galion Fire Department
and other fire departments that are called for mutual aid and that typically
draw water from a public water supply into tanks that do not contain anti-
corrosive chemicals and/or agents. This User Type does not require the use of a
backflow prevention device. Except for the Galion Fire Department, all
connections to a Galion fire hydrant must be reported to the Galion Police/Fire
Dispatcher, or Fire Chief on the scene, either on radio frequency or by
telephone (419-468-9111) prior to attachment to a fire hydrant and the
withdrawal of water.
      (2)   User Type 2. This User Type consists of fire departments that
typically fill tanks from streams, creeks or ponds rather than from a public
water supply and/or fire departments that have tanks containing anti-corrosive
chemicals or agents and/or fire departments that do not have tanks meeting the
NFP 1901 standard. This User Type must use a backflow device previously
approved by the Mayor or his designated representative between the hydrant and
the tank. All connections by this User Type to a Galion fire hydrant must be
reported to the Galion Police/Fire Dispatcher, either on radio frequency or by
telephone (419-468-9111) prior to attachment to a hydrant is made.
      (3)   User Type 3. This User Type consist of Galion Public Works
Department employees and equipment. Routine, periodic or quality driven
flushing of fire hydrants does not require the use of backflow device so long
as an air gap is maintained between the end of the hose and the point of use.
Provided a City employee remains on site to ensure that an air gap is
maintained, the filling of swimming pools by City employees does not require
the use of a backflow device. Any filling of equipment (i.e. trucks, including
those owned by the City) does require the use of a backflow device or an air-
gap device that has been preapproved by the Mayor or his designated
representative. Before any attachment by User Type 3 is made to a fire hydrant
connected to the Galion Water System, the Galion Water Division Superintendent
must be notified.
      (4)   User Type 4. This User Type includes attachment to a fire hydrant
by a licensed food vendor. This type of use if for a limited amount of time and
is controlled by the Galion Health Department as to the type of hose used and
the backflow devices required. Before attachment is made to a fire hydrant
connected to the Galion Water System, a User Type 4 must first notify the
Galion Health Department.
      (5)   User Type 5. This User Type is for all other water use including
bulk sale of water. All such other use shall occur at the fill station at the
Water Treatment Plant and must be overseen by employees of the Water Treatment
Plant.
   In addition to the foregoing permitted uses, further exceptions may be
considered by the Mayor or his designated representative, and if approved, any
such exception must be authorized in writing as to the time, location and
manner of attaching to a fire hydrant connected to the Galion Water System,
including the type of backflow prevention device, if any.
   (c)   Any person, firm, corporation or governmental entity that attaches to
a fire hydrant connected to the Galion Water System in violation of the terms
and requirements of this section shall be guilty of a first degree misdemeanor.
(Ord. 2003-26. Passed 3-11-03.)
921.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be fined not more than
one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues.

923.07 STORMWATER SYSTEM COMPOSITION AND DESIGN.
   (a)   The Stormwater Runoff Management System shall be composed of:
      (1)   A primary system;
      (2)   A secondary 100 year flood system; and
      (3)    A secondary 10 year flood system.
   (b)   These regulations shall limit any activity which will adversely affect
the hydraulic function of detention facilities, open channels, drainage swales
or enclosed stormwater conveyance systems.
   (c)   Stormwater runoff retention from sites in excess of one acre shall be
limited to a factor of one and shall conform to requirements established by the
City Engineer. Extra retention may be required on sites abutting ditches or
storm sewers not designed for a ten year flood.
   (d)   When the City Engineer determines that proposed development will cause
or increase downstream flooding conditions during the 100 year storm,
provisions shall be made to minimize such flooding conditions and shall be
included in the design of storm drainage improvements. Such provisions may
include downstream improvements and/or temporary controlled detention of
stormwater runoff and its regulated discharge to the downstream storm drainage
system.
   (e)   The design and construction of drainage systems shall be such that
watercourse traversing the project and natural water emanating from within the
project shall be carried through and off the project without injury to
improvements, building sites or buildings existing or to be installed within or
adjacent to the project. Drainage water entering the project shall be received
and discharged at locations and as nearly as possible in the manner that
existed prior to construction of the drainage facilities within the project.
The design of drainage facilities within the project shall be such that they
shall conform to the ultimate drainage requirements of the land uses within the
project watershed.
      (1)   The primary system shall be constructed and maintained under
Chapter 1338, Flood Damage Prevention Standards.
      (2)   The secondary 100 year flood system shall be designed to allow
uphill stormwater to flow onto and through the project whenever the ten year
flood system is filled to and overflowing its capacity. It shall be designed to
prevent the flooding of the main floor of buildings existing or to be
constructed within the project and to further prevent the flooding of the main
floor of the building downhill and uphill from the project. It may utilize open
ditches, existing drainageways, drainage swales, open channels, roadways,
public rights of way, temporary and permanent detention basins and temporary
detention of stormwater runoff in wet bottom basins, dry bottom basins, parking
lots, rooftops, percolation storage or other means approved by the City
Engineer.
      (3)   The secondary ten year flood system shall be designed to prevent
the possible flooding against building walls of existing and future building
construction on the site and to prevent the flooding against building walls of
existing and future buildings on adjacent sites.
         It shall be designed to drain standing stormwater from the site within
six hours after the termination of any ten year storm. When swales are not
steep enough to accomplish this, a drain tile and stormwater inlet shall be
constructed in the low point of yards and drained through tile to a public
storm sewer or ditch.
         It shall utilize storm sewer, yard slope and drainage swales to
contain uphill and on site stormwater within the site which shall be discharged
to a public storm sewer or ditch and not allowed to discharge onto adjacent
property not part of a public ditch or storm sewers.
         Yards shall be graded and maintained to drain away from buildings
within an eight foot perimeter of buildings to swales or catch basins channeled
to prevent stormwater damage to adjacent properties. Minimum grade over sod or
grounds shall be one fourth inch per foot. Minimum grade over concrete or
pavement shall be one-eighth inch per foot.
   (f)   When a ditch or storm sewer drains across private property an easement
shall be obtained and/or provided.
   (g)   Driveways may not intersect the pavement higher than the pavement
edge. This is to prevent a snow plow from catching the edge of the driveway.
   (h)   Culverts under driveways shall be installed large enough and steep
enough to prevent flooding of the pavement during any ten year flood and shall
be constructed in anticipation of any downstream blockage removal and/or
replacement. Culvert tile shall be corrugated metal pipe or equivalent and be a
minimum size of twelve inches unless a storm sewer already exists along the
street which is designed for ten year flooding, thereby allowing an eight inch
culvert tile.
   (i)   The top of a culvert pipe shall be located at least five inches below
the pavement edge to allow a swale for roadway to drain to in the event the
culvert tile are extended across the lot. This may mean that the bottom of the
tile is located below the bottom of the ditch or other adjacent tile. Tile
shall be installed with a downhill grade of at least four inches in every 100
feet of length.
   (j)   Parking lots for commercial, industrial or multifamily buildings shall
not drain onto any City street pavement.
923.08 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Easements to the City for the maintenance of storm sewers shall be of
width and alignment as stated in the subdivision ordinance and shall be
indicated on a plat or on an easement deed and shall be accepted by Council.
   (b)   Easements for mutual benefit of owners shall be required over all
ditches and swales located on sites which will accept or are designed to accept
water during any ten year flood. Natural watercourses which traverse a project
shall be preserved by an easement of sufficient width, including overbanks,
which shall adequately pass the project design flow. The channel and overbank
widths, together with a minimum twenty foot continuous maintenance way on one
side, shall constitute the floodway encroachment limits.
   (c)   Easements for mutual benefit of owners shall be provided in a form
ready for recording and shall include a provision to be maintained by the
property owner for the benefit of the uphill property owners with provision
that any disputes shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the rules
of the American Arbitration Association.
923.09 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Residential Garage Floors. Residential garage floors shall drain to
the outside under the garage door or to a storm sewer drain in the garage
floor.
   (b)   Surface Drains. Surface drains shall be constructed along the foot of
any of the natural ridges to control the flow of spring waters.
   (c)   Additional Footer Tile. Additional footer tile shall be installed at
the low point of any footer located in ground indicated as a severe limitation
for homesites.
   (d)   Roof Gutters. Roof gutters shall be required on all roofs above and
within eight feet of any basement or crawl space. Roof water diverters or
gutters are required on roofs over walkways and driveways. Downspouts are
required on gutters and drained into storm sewers or onto pavement without
drainage across unpaved yards or walkways to a storm sewer and shall not drain
into sanitary sewers or footer tile.
   (e)   Drainage to Sanitary Sewer Prohibited. None of the following shall be
drained to a sanitary sewer: storm water, basement floor drains without a trap
primer, garage floor drains, footer tile, area wells, storm water or subsurface
water sump pumps, air conditioner condenser water to a floor drain or to the
sanitary sewer pipe without a trap primer.
   (f)   Footing Drain Discharge. Where footing drain discharge is deposited
upon the surface of the ground, the place of deposit shall be in that yard area
that drains directly to a street, road or ditch, or to the yard area which
contains a drainage easement. Discharge of such water upon the surface of the
ground shall be carried not less than eight feet from the foundation of walls
by means of splash blocks which shall be installed at the time of construction.
Footing drain discharge shall not be permitted to a roadway unless an adequate
road ditch exists to receive such discharge. Footing drain discharge shall not
be directed to, over or through a road curb.
   (g)   Sump Pumps. Sump pumps shall not discharge onto a street pavement or
within an area that could puddle and freeze on the pavement.

   (b)   Periodic Compliance Report:
      (1)   Any User subject to a Pretreatment Standard set forth in this
chapter, after the compliance date of such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the
case of a New User, after commencement of the Discharge to the City, shall
submit to the City during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently by the City, a report indicating the nature and concentration, of
prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the
Pretreatment Standards hereof.
   Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided
however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the City may accept
reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The
City, for good cause shown considering such factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors may authorize the
submission of such reports on months other than those specified above.
      (2)   Reports of Users shall contain all results of sampling and analysis
of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or
production and mass where required by the City. The frequency of monitoring by

rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used as measured by the City
water meter there is use, and the quantity of water used and waste discharged
as determined by subsections (b) and (c), and the whole reduced by any
deductions as determined by subsection (d).
   (b)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises, discharging
sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids into the City's
sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, uses water provided in
whole or in part from sources of water supply other than provided by the City

925.66 DISPOSAL PLANT PERMIT; HOURS AND FEE.
   No Septic Tank Hauler will be permitted to dispose of Septic Wastes at the
City of Galion’s Wastewater Treatment Plant until all of the following
conditions have been met:
   (a)   A completed Waste Hauler Manifest Form must be approved and signed by
Treatment Plant personnel before discharging.
   (b)   A minimum fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) will be charged for each load
discharged. Load amounts that exceed 2,000 gallons will be charged an
additional twenty dollars ($20.00) per 1000 gallons. Loads from restaurant
grease traps will be charged an additional ten dollars ($10.00). (Restaurant
grease will only be accepted from the Gallon/Crestline area and will only be
accepted with prior notification to the plant. Grease is discharged directly to
the digester. Acceptance of grease can be canceled at any time by the Director
due to a plant operational problem or a change in process. Exceptions can be
granted on a case by case basis by the Director and must be in writing.) All
dumping fees will be paid before discharging. Load tickets will be purchased at
the Treasurer’s office during their normal business hours. IOUs will not be
accepted!
   (c)   Completion of the Waste Hauler Manifest Form and acceptance of the
“dumping” fee does not constitute acceptance of the septage load. If the Plant
Operator has reason to suspect the content or the safety of the load in respect
to treatment compatibility and/or safety to the plant, equipment, and/or
operator, the Plant Operator can order the Septage Hauler to cease his
discharge. The Operator may, without prior notification to the septage hauler,
refuse to receive loads during extremely high flows which cause bypass at the
screen Building. The Operator may also refuse to accept a load, without prior
notification to the septage hauler, if accepting the load will cause upset to
the treatment plant due to a mechanical problem and/or a treatment problem in
the plant.
   (d)   All Septage Haulers will be inspected and licensed each year by the
City of Galion Health Department or other entity selected by the Director.
Septage haulers not inspected and licensed by the City of Galion will not be
permitted to discharge at the Galion Wastewater Treatment Plant. The Health
Department will determine any fees charged for inspection, the content of the
License Application Form, and the content of the inspection. Licenses will be
issued to specific trucks with a list of authorized and qualified drivers
attached.
   (e)   Drivers of Licensed Haulers will read and sign the Domestic Waste
Certification Statement before they are added to the Authorized Driver List for
that Hauler. Loads will not be accepted unless the driver has signed the
Domestic Waste Certification Statement.
   (f)   The City of Galion accepts Residential (Domestic) Waste only. Waste
from some commercial establishments may be accepted with prior approval of the
Director of Sewer/Water. A current list will be maintained at the Galion
Wastewater Treatment Plant. These waste streams will be accepted only if they
are “restroom only” wastes. No process wastes will be accepted by truck. Any
Septage waste may be subject to testing at the expense of the hauler.
   (g)   Under certain conditions, sludge from package sewage treatment plants
will be accepted. The operators of these systems will have a written agreement
with the City of Galion with conditions set forth in the agreement governing
the acceptance of these wastes. In addition to the trucking charge stated
above, a processing charge will apply. This charge will be based on the dry
solid content of the sludge and the current cost of processing Galion’s sludge.
This fee will be set by the Director.
   (h)   Septage hauling hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. any day.

   (b)   The deposit amount shall be based upon an average monthly utility
billing cost during the preceding twelve months at the customer’s location. The
deposit will be equally applied to the water, sewer, and electric services
utilized by the customer (e.g., a one hundred fifty dollar ($150.00) deposit
will apply equally to each service, fifty dollars ($50.00) water; fifty dollars
($50.00) sewer; and fifty dollars ($50.00) electric.
   (c)   The City reserves the right to require an additional deposit if
customer’s past record of payment on accounts and/or utility usage indicates
that such deposit is required to assure payment from that customer. Such
deposit includes, but is not limited to: a history of past delinquency with the
City, poor credit rating as evidenced by a credit report, a history of
bankruptcy, disconnection for nonpayment of bill, checks returned for
insufficient funds, and/or increased utility requirements.
   (d)   No interest on deposits shall be accrued or paid.
   (e)   At the end of one year of continuous utility service, the deposit may
be refunded to the customer upon written request if the customer has
established and maintained a record of timely payment of all utility charges as
defined herein.
   (f)   A deposit may be applied to the customer’s current utility service
bill (water, sewer, and electric) or any deposit or portion thereof not needed
to pay customer’
   (g)   Utility service shall not be granted until such time that a deposit is
made, unless waived by the City. (Ord. 2006-50. Passed 7-11-06.)

flat fee established by the City Council for an Equivalent Residential Unit. An
Equivalent Residential Unit is hereby defined as the statistical average
horizontal impervious area of all residential units in the City of Galion.
   (b)    Parcels which are undeveloped shall be assessed a stormwater user
fee. The bill shall be determined by dividing the total land area of the
property, in square feet, by the area of an Equivalent Residential Unit times a
correction factor. The correction factor shall be based on the relative volume
of runoff from an undeveloped property and that of a typical single family
residence, under typical hydrologic conditions.

enterprise, business establishment, building, or other occupancy not covered by
subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the rate shall be computed based on
the total impervious area of the property divided by the average impervious
area of an Equivalent Residential Unit times the rate established for an
equivalent residential unit. The billing amount shall be updated by the City
Engineer based on any additions to the impervious areas as approved through the
building permit process.

appropriate to provide relief from a strict application of the provisions of
this chapter due to unique circumstances in the following areas:
      (1)    Calculation of the total number of building units assigned to a
property that are claimed to be inaccurate due to alleged inaccuracies in data
utilized by the billing staff.
      (2)   Adjustment to or credit against billing units assigned to a
property which wholly or partially drains directly outside the City limits.
      (3)   Adjustments arising from a break in billing units due to change in

notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (3)    The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (c)    Exemptions. The following discharges are exempt from discharge
prohibitions established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows,
rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated
pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active
groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less
than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source
not containing Pollutants.
   (d)    Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)    The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. This prohibition
expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past,
regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.
      (2)    A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. (Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.09 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)    Suspension Due to Illegal Discharges and/or Illicit Connections in
Emergency Situations. The Division of Stormwater of the City may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may
present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to
minimize danger to persons.
   (b)    Suspension Due to the Detection of Illegal Discharge and/or Illicit
Connection. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illegal Discharge and/or an Illicit Connection. The authorized enforcement
agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access.
The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a
reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person
reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without
the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 2008-71. Passed
11-18-08.)
935.10 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.
Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to
the Stormwater Division of the City prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4. (Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.11 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)    Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)    The City of Galion Stormwater Division shall be permitted to enter
and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)    Facility operators shall allow the Storm Water Division of the
City ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the
conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of
any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)    The Stormwater Division of the City shall have the right to set up
on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
      (4)    The Stormwater Division of the City has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Stormwater Division of the City
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by
the operator.
      (6)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the Stormwater Division of the
City access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge
permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a
NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity
commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency
reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any
activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)    If the Stormwater Division of the City has been refused access to
any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health,
safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
         (Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.12 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY THE
USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Stormwater Division of the City will adopt requirements identifying Best
Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause
or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.13 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.14  NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in Illegal Discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S.
said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non- hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the Stormwater Division of the City within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three years.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.15  ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever the Stormwater Division of the City finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the
authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written Notice of
Violation to the responsible person. Such Notice may require without
limitation:
   (a)    The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
   (b)    The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
   (c)    That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
   (d)    The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination
hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
   (e)    Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and
.
   (f)    The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the Notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said Notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.16 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within

   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the Notice of Violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within seven
(7) days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the decision of
the authorized enforcement agency, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or
restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or
person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency
or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.18 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   (a)   Within ten (10) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of
the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including
administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting
to the amount of the assessment within ten (10) days. If the amount due is not
paid in a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal
authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the
charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment.
   (b)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall
become liable to the City by reason of such violation. The liability shall be
paid in not more than twelve (12) equal payments. Interest at the rate of six
percent (6%) per annum shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the 1st
day following discovery of the violation.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)
935.19  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the authorized
enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or
compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
(Ord. 2008-71. Passed 11-18-08.)

violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel
the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. The authorized enforcement agency
may recover all attorney's fees court costs and other expenses associated with
enforcement of this chapter, including sampling and monitoring expenses. (Ord.

Emergency Medical Services
949.01   Definitions.
949.02   Fees.
949.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    "Basic Life Support" (BLS) services means any pre-hospital medical
intervention requiring an emergency response by personnel certified at the
levels of EMT- Basic or EMT-Paramedic employed by the City of Galion or another
political subdivision responding to a call for emergency medical services in
the City of Galion. An emergency response is one that, at the time local 911 is
called, a response unit is dispatched immediately. Medical interventions
include, but are not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), oxygen
administration, bleeding control, treatment of shock, splinting of fractures,
childbirth, and patient assessment, including taking and recording patient
vital signs, etc.
   (b)    "Advanced Life Support Level 1" (ALS1) services means the provision
of the following medical services requiring the immediate response of an ALS
crew and vehicle, and including the provision of ambulance transport service
that provides equipment and staff needed to provide complex specialized life-
sustaining procedures to patients under the direction of a physician who
provides medical control. Such complex specialized life-sustaining services may
include, but not be limited to, administering IV therapy, establishing and
maintaining a patient's airway, relieving pneumothorax conditions, cardiac
monitoring, etc. ALS service includes the provision of an ALS assessment or at
least one ALS intervention. An ALS assessment is an assessment performed by an
ALS crew as part of an emergency response that is necessary because the
patient's reported condition at the time of dispatch is such that only an ALS

stayed other than by a restraining order which may, on due cause shown, be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals after notice to the Code Inspector, or

1115.02  POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal
in specific cases, as hereinafter provided, such variances from the provisions
or requirements of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interest. Such variances shall be granted only in cases of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions of the land, whereby strict application of such
requirements would result in practical difficulty that would deprive the owner
of the reasonable use of the land and buildings involved. No variance from
strict application of any provision of this Ordinance shall be granted by the
Board unless it finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following
facts and conditions exist:
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such necessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public health, safety and/or
welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a variance
that would allow a use not permissible under this Ordinance in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this Ordinance in said district.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1115.03 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE AND APPEALS.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property, after being denied a
zoning certificate, may file an application to obtain a variance or appeal from
the decision of the Code Inspector, with the Board of Zoning Appeals, on a form
as specified for that purpose.
   The application for a variance or an appeal shall contain the following
information:

Recorder's office.

on the Crawford County Auditor's current tax list.

provisions of this Ordinance which apply.
   (f)   A narrative statement explaining the following:
      (1)   The use for which variance or appeal is sought.
      (2)   Details of the variance or appeal that is applied for and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the variance or appeal should be granted,
as the case may be.
      (3)   The specific reasons why the variance or appeal is justified,
according to Section
 1115.02 (a) to (e) above.
         (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1115.04  PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of an application for an appeal from decision of the Code
Inspector. At such hearing, any party may appear in person or may be
represented by agent or attorney.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1115.05  NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   Before holding any public hearing pursuant to Section

of general circulation in the City at least ten (10) days before the date of
said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public
hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance. In addition,
written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the Code Inspector, by first-
class mail, at least ten (10) days before the day of the hearing to all parties
of interest. The notice shall contain the same information as required of
notice published in newspapers as specified above. Parties of interest shall
include at a minimum, owners and occupants of property within 200 feet from,
contiguous to, and directly across the street from the property being
considered. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate the actions
of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

question need not be notified.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1115.06  ACTION BY BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing pursuant to Section

supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1115.07, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall transmit a written copy of its decision and findings to the Code
Inspector, who shall forward such copy to the applicant. If the application is
approved, or approved with supplementary conditions, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application
justify the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use
of the land, building or structure.
   If the request for appeal or variance is denied, the applicant may seek
relief pursuant to procedures as cited in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1115.07 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may
prescribe appropriate and reasonable conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a
part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall be
deemed a violation of this Ordinance and punishable under Section
1119.02 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
CHAPTER 1117
Conditional Uses
1117.01   Purpose.
1117.02   Application for conditional use.
1117.03   General standards for conditional uses.
1117.04   Action by the Planning Commission.
1117.05   Supplementary conditions.
1117.06   Expiration and revocation of zoning permit issued under conditional
use provisions.
1117.01  PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances, a proposed use which more intensely
affects an area than those uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is
located, may nonetheless be desirable and compatible with permitted uses, if
that use is properly controlled and regulated. Such uses shall be listed as
conditional uses within the description of the respective zoning districts. The
Planning Commission may allow such a use to be established as a conditional use
where these unusual circumstances exist and where the proposed use will be
consistent with the general purpose and intent of this Planning and Zoning
Code.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1117.02  APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an application
to use such property for a conditional use provided for by this Ordinance in
the zoning district in which the property is situated. An application for a
conditional use shall be filed in triplicate with the Code Inspector, who shall
forward a copy to the Planning Commission. The application shall contain the
following information:.
   (a)   All of the information required for a zoning permit, pursuant to
Section
1109.03.
   (b)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic circulation, open
spaces, landscaping, refuse, and service areas, utilities, signs, yards, and
such other information as the Commission may require to determine if the
proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this Ordinance.
   (c)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property,
and a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and other
properties in the district.
   (d)   The names and addresses of all property owners contiguous to, and
directly across the street from the property, as appearing on the Crawford
County Auditor's current tax list.
   (e)   Such other information regarding the property, proposed use, or
surrounding area as may be pertinent to the deliberations of the Planning
Commission.
      (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1117.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Commission shall not approve a conditional use unless it shall, in each
specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based on the particular
evidence presented to it, that support conclusions that such use at the
proposed location shall meet all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the general character of
such area.
   (b)   Seeks to maintain, and will not be hazardous to, the health, safety
and welfare of the existing neighborhood, and the total community.
   (c)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   (d)   Will not create excessive additional requirements for public
facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of
the community.
   (e)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors.
   (f)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designated as not to interfere with traffic on surrounding public streets or
roads.
   (g)   Complies with any other requirements or standards that are cited under
the specific zoning district regulations of this Ordinance.
      (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1117.04 ACTION BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Within sixty (60) days from the date of the application, the Commission
shall approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified in Section
 1117.05, or disapprove the application as presented. In rendering its
decision, the Commission may contact and seek input from adjacent property
owners and/or other interested parties. If the application is approved with
supplementary conditions, the Commission shall direct the Code Inspector to
issue a zoning certificate listing the specific conditions listed by the
Commission for approval. If the application is disapproved, the applicant may
seek relief pursuant to other ordinances of the City. If no action is taken by
the Commission within the specified time frame, the application shall be
considered as approved.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1117.05  SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS.
   In granting any conditional use, the Commission may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1117.06 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION OF ZONING PERMIT ISSUED UNDER CONDITIONAL USE
PROVISIONS.
   The approval of the zoning certificate issued in accordance with Section
1117.04 above, shall become null and void if such use is not fully implemented,
as evidenced by issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, within one (1)
year after date of approval; however, the Planning Commission may grant an
extension of a zoning certificate for a conditional use for an additional
period of six (6) months. The Planning Commission may revoke the zoning
certificate, if it finds, based upon written evidence by any citizen or
official of the City, of violation of this Ordinance and/or written terms and
conditions upon which approval was based.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
CHAPTER 1119
Fees and Violations
1119.01   Schedule of fees, charges and expenses.
1119.02   Violation.
1119.01 SCHEDULE OF FEES, CHARGES AND EXPENSES.
   The City Council shall establish, by separate ordinance, a schedule of fees,
charges, and expenses and a collection procedure for zoning certificates,
subdivision plats, appeals, and other matters pertaining to this Ordinance. The
schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the Code Inspector, and may
be altered or amended only by the City Council. Until all applicable fees,
charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no action shall be taken on any
application.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1119.02 VIOLATION.
   (a)   Violation and Remedies. If any building is or is proposed to be
located, erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, changed, demolished,
maintained or used, or any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of
this Planning and Zoning Ordinance or any amendment or supplement thereto, City
Council, the Mayor or any citizen who would be specifically damaged by such
violation may, in addition to other remedies provided by law, institute
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, demolition, conversion, maintenance,
or use; to restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy
of such building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct,
business or use in or about such premises.
   (b)   Failure to Obtain a Required Certificate or Approval. Failure to
obtain a zoning certificate, Certificate of Zoning Compliance, or other
approval as required by specific Sections of this Ordinance shall be a
violation of this Ordinance and punishable under subsection (e) below.
   (c)   Construction and Use to be as Provided in Applications, Plans,
Permits, and Certificates. Zoning certificates or other approvals issued on the
basis of plans, plats and/or applications authorize only the use, and
arrangement set forth in such approved plans and applications or amendments
thereto. Any use, arrangement, or construction not in conformance with that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance, and punishable as
provided in subsection (e) below.
   (d)   Complaints Regarding Violations. Whenever a violation of this
Ordinance is alleged to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint.
Such complaint shall state fully the causes and basis thereof, and shall be
filed with the Code Inspector. The Code Inspector shall record properly such
complaint, immediately investigate, and take such appropriate action thereon as
may be necessary and provided for by this Ordinance.
   (e)   Penalties for Violation. Violation of the provisions of this Ordinance
or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in various sections of this Ordinance)
shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this Ordinance or fails
to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined
not more than $500 and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in
the case. Each day such violation continues, after receipt of violation notice,
shall be considered a separate offense.
The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and
any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits,
participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found
guilty of a separate offense and be subject to the penalties herein provided.
Penalties as above shall apply unless penalties are defined for specific
sections of this Ordinance, in which case the penalties so defined in those
sections shall apply.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
CHAPTER 1121
Nonconformities
1121.01   Intent.
1121.02   Nonconforming uses.
1121.03   Nonconforming structures.
1121.04   Nonconforming lots of record.
1121.01 INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance, or amendments
hereinafter adopted, there may exist land, structures and/or lots, or uses
thereof, which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit
such nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not necessarily to
encourage their survival and expansion except as provided herein.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1121.02 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Continuation. Any use of land, structures or buildings existing on the
effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, even though such use does
not conform to the provisions herein, so long as such use was legally existing
prior to the establishment of this Ordinance. No nonconforming use shall be
moved, extended, enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as
provided in this Ordinance.
   (b)   Substitution. The Planning Commission may allow the nonconforming use
of land or a building or structure to be changed to another nonconforming use
of the same or of a more restricted classification, provided no structural
alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made. However, in an
"R" District, no change in use shall be authorized by the Planning Commission
unless the applicant clearly demonstrates that
      (1)   The existing and proposed nonconforming uses were lawful at the
time of enactment of this Ordinance, and
      (2)   Such substitution is generally compatible with adjacent land use
and zoning patterns.
   (c)   Expansion/Extension. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as follows:
      (1)   The Planning Commission may permit a lawful nonconforming use to be
expanded within an existing structure manifestly arranged or developed for such
use, provided the applicant clearly demonstrates that such expansion is
necessary and incidental to the continuance of such lawful nonconforming use.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may permit the expansion or extension of a
nonconforming use of land, not involving the physical expansion of a building
or structure, to an area consisting of one-hundred-twenty-five percent (125%)
of the area enclosing the nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this
Ordinance, provided such expansion occurs on the same lot as existing on the
effective date of this Ordinance. In such cases, the applicant shall clearly
demonstrate that the foregoing conditions have been met, that such expansion is
necessary and incidental to the continuance of such lawful nonconforming use
and that such expansion does not encroach on any yard or setback required for
the district in which the nonconforming use is located.
   (d)   Discontinuance. A nonconforming use which has been discontinued or
abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned whenever either of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   When the use has been voluntarily discontinued for a period of two
(2) years.
      (2)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
         (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1121.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction or designated use of any structure on which actual construction
was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance or amendment
hereto and upon which actual building construction has been diligently
continued, provided such construction is completed within two (2) years from
the effective date of this Ordinance.
   (a)   Nonconforming Mobile Homes. A nonconforming mobile home, as defined in
Chapter
1103 of this Ordinance, located in any district, once removed shall not be
relocated on such lot, or replaced with another mobile home. No enlargement,
extension or expansion of a nonconforming mobile home, as defined in Chapter
1103, shall be permitted within the City of Galion.
   (b)   Extension.
      (1)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or
in part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard
and other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of
the district in which such building or structure is to be located.
      (2)   Any structure which is nonconforming due to its location or
configuration on the lot, resulting in lot coverage or yards inconsistent with
the requirements of the zoning district where it is located, may be enlarged,
extended or structurally altered in a manner that decreases or maintains its
existing degree of nonconformity, but in no case shall such structure be
enlarged, extended or structurally altered in a manner that increases its
degree of nonconformity.
      (3)   Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a non-residential zoning district may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed or structurally altered, provided it meets the requirements of
the most proximate R-District.
   (c)   Damage and/or Destruction of a Nonconforming Building or Use. When a
building or structure, the use or location of which does not conform to the
provisions of this Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the
public enemy, it may be restored or rebuilt and continued in such nonconforming
use, provided that the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The restoration or rebuilding is commenced within six (6) months of
the time of damage, and construction is completed within one (1) year, unless
an extension is requested from and granted by the Planning Commission, and
      (2)   The damaged or destroyed building was not located in such a manner
so as to encroach or intrude on adjacent property, and
      (3)   Such restoration or rebuilding would not extend or expand the
existing use beyond the parameters established in Section
1121.04 below.
If any part of the damaged or destroyed building encroaches or intrudes on
adjacent property, the location of the restored or rebuilt structure is subject
to approval by the Planning Commission. If the restoration or rebuilding of the
structure involves extension or expansion of the use, then the provisions of
Section
 1121.04 shall apply.
   (d)   Maintenance and Repair. Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed to
prevent normal maintenance and repair of a nonconforming building or structure,
or a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use when at least one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   When required by law.
      (2)   To convert to a conforming use.
      (3)   A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses
may be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height requirements or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.
         (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1121.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one-family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record on the effective date of
this Ordinance, even though such lot does not comply with the lot area and
width requirements of the district in which it is located, provided said lot
has a minimum lot area of 3,000 square feet and at least thirty (30) feet
frontage on a public right-of-way; and further provided the following
conditions are complied with:
   (a)   If the owner of such lot does not own adjacent property and did not
own such property at the time this Ordinance became effective, two (2) inches
may be deducted from the required minimum width of each side yard and four (4)
inches from the required sum of minimum widths of both side yards for each foot
that the lot is narrower than the required width for the district. In no case,
however, shall any side yard be narrower than three (3) feet.
   (b)   If the owner of such lot owns two (2) or more adjacent lots, or other
adjacent property, such owner shall redivide the property in such a manner that
they conform to the minimum width of such lots in the most proximate single-
family district. However, if such redivsion would result in lots that exceed
width requirement of lots in the most proximate district, such redivision shall
provide for one (1) more building lot than would otherwise be allowed.

CHAPTER 1127
Standard Zoning District Regulations
1127.01   Regulation of the use and development of land or structures.
1127.02   Rules of application.
1127.01  REGULATION OF THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LAND OR STRUCTURES.
   Regulations pertaining to the use of land and/or structures, and the
physical development thereof within each of the zoning districts as established
in Chapter
1129, are hereby established and adopted.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1127.02 RULES OF APPLICATION.
   (a)   Identification of Uses. Listed uses are to be defined by their
customary name or identification, except as specifically defined or limited in
this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
   (b)   Permitted Uses.
(1)   Only a use designated as permitted shall be allowed as a matter of right
in any zoning district, and any use not so designated shall be prohibited
unless:
A.   A permitted use may be added to a zoning district by formal amendment, in
conformance with Chapter
1113 of this Ordinance.
B.   An unlisted use may be determined by the Planning Commission to be a
similar use, in accordance with Section
1127.02(e) of this Chapter.
         C.   Any use required to be a permitted use under federal or state law
in any zoning district is a permitted use under this Ordinance as required by
the applicable law.
            (Ord. 2019-87. Passed 12-10-19.)
(2)   No more than one (1) permitted use shall exist on any one zoning lot.
   (c)   Accessory Uses. An accessory use or structure is a subordinate use or
structure clearly incidental and secondary to the principal permitted building
or use, and located on the same lot with such principal building or use.
Accessory uses or structures shall be allowed in accordance with the specific
district regulations, and the requirements of Section
1175.01 of this Ordinance.
   (d)   Conditional Uses. A use designated as a conditional use shall be
allowed in the zoning district where the designation occurs, when such use, its
location, extent and method of development will not substantially alter the
character of the vicinity, or unduly interfere with or adversely impact the use
of adjacent lots. To this end, the Planning Commission may in addition to the
development standards for the specific district, set forth additional
requirements as will render the conditional use compatible with existing and
future use of adjacent lots in the vicinity, in accordance with Chapter
1117 of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Similar Uses. Determination as to whether a use is similar to uses
permitted by right shall be considered as an expansion of use regulations of
the district and not as a variance applying to a particular situation. Any use
found similar shall thereafter be considered as a permitted use in that
district.
   Applications for zoning permits for uses not specifically listed in the
permitted building or use classifications of the zoning district, which the
applicant feels qualify as a similar use under the provisions of this Section,
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
   Within thirty (30) days after such submittal, the Planning Commission shall
determine whether the requested use is similar to those uses permitted in the
specific district. In order to find that a use is similar, the Planning
Commission shall find that all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   Such use is not listed as a permitted or conditional use in another
zoning district.
      (2)   Such use conforms to basic characteristics of the classification to
which it is to be added and is more appropriate to it than to any other
classification.
      (3)   Such use creates no increased danger to health and safety, creates
no increased level of noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or
other objectionable impacts, and does not create traffic congestion to an
extent greater than normally resulting from uses listed in the classification
to which it is to be added.
   (f)   Development Standards. Development standards set forth shall be the
minimum allowed for uses permitted in that district. If development standards
are in conflict with requirements of any other lawfully adopted rule,
regulation, or law, the most restrictive standard shall govern.
   (g)   Site Plan. For particular uses in specific districts and most
conditional uses, a Site Plan will be cited as required. In such cases, the
Site Plan shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of the application
for a zoning permit, or at such time when the property is rezoned into that
district. The Site Plan shall contain a site plan for the property, drawn to
approximate scale, showing all property lines, existing buildings, access
drives, parking areas, existing vegetation and other notable physical features.
The Site Plan shall also show the location, outlines and size of all proposed
structures including the design of all improvements including drainage, private
streets, water and sanitary sewer lines, as well as the size, design, materials
and location of all signage proposed for the development. The Site Plan shall
also contain a narrative description of the proposed use, and an evaluation of
how such use may impact adjacent property and methods that will be employed to
alleviate or minimize any adverse impacts.
   The Site Plan shall be reviewed by the Code Inspector and may be subject to
review by the Planning Commission. The Site Plan must be approved as a
condition for the issuance of a zoning certificate. In reviewing such Plan, the
Code inspector and/or Planning Commission may seek the timely input from
specific consultants. In approving a Site Plan, the Code Inspector and/or
Planning Commission shall find that the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   The use(s) and structure(s), as proposed, can be adequately and
efficiently served by public streets and utilities.
      (2)   The proposed building or use shall have sufficient yard space to
provide for adequate parking and screening of adjacent residential areas as may
be required in this Ordinance.
      (3)   The location, design and operation of the proposed use shall not
impose undue adverse impacts on surrounding residential neighborhoods, and/or
the Site Plan for the proposed facility has incorporated measures to lessen
and/or alleviate such adverse impacts and protect the character of such
adjacent residential areas.
      (4)   The use(s) and structure(s), as proposed, are generally consistent
with the purposes and intent of the zoning district and other provisions of
this Ordinance.
   (h)   Essential Services. Essential Services, as defined and specified in
Chapter
1103 of this Ordinance, shall be permitted in any and all zoning districts
within the municipality.

between permitted uses and overall traffic movement, and minimizing negative
impacts on adjacent land uses. The GC District is not intended to be used in
the existing downtown core area as a substitute for the U District.

and said outdoor dining area may not extend past the edge of the building in
which the establishment is housed.

ingress and egress from any entrance to the business establishment.
      (3)   That the retail food and/or drink establishment business owner
shall maintain the sidewalk in a clean and safe condition, and shall
immediately clear the sidewalk area when ordered to do so by any City of Galion
official, including the Chief of Police or Fire Chief or their authorized
representatives.
      (4)   That the retail food and/or drink establishment owner maintain

is on an annual, renewable basis, and during each period, the permit holder
must remain compliant with all of the following:
         •   Food trays or carts, receptacles for dirty dishes, etc. cannot be
stored on any portion of the public right of way.
         •   All tables, chairs, etc. must be promptly removed from the

      (1)   An application must be submitted by the owner of the retail food
and/or drink establishment and, if said owner is a lessee, with the building
owner's written permission, seeking to create or to significantly change an
existing outdoor dining facility. It is assumed by both the City and the
Applicant that permitted outdoor dining facilities are intended only for
business customers and other invited guests of the retail food and/or drink
establishment; a clearly delineated area within the public right of way for
outdoor dining by definition removes access to the facilities by the general
public.
      (2)   Applications for outdoor dining facilities will be considered by
the City only if the Applicant is in full compliance with the City income tax
and real estate tax obligations, as well as property maintenance requirements.
         (Ord. 2016-32. Passed 6-14-16.)
      (3)   Applications will be reviewed by City staff on a first-come, first-
served basis, with all such applications forwarded to the City of Galion Design
Review Board for guidance, input, and approval on materials, placement, and
overall aesthetics of proposed outdoor dining facilities. The Design Review
Board shall base its review and decision on the design guidelines included
herein. (Ord. 2018-5. Passed 3-13-18.)
      (4)   Retail food and/or drink establishments seeking to serve alcohol as
part of their proposed outdoor dining facility must comply with all relevant
City of Galion ordinances relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol on
public property, as well as all relevant laws of the State of Ohio Department
of Commerce, Division of Liquor Control. In all applications for, or
permissions granted, by the City of Galion concerning outdoor dining
facilities, the retail food and/or drink establishment must remain in good
standing and otherwise compliant with all Division of Liquor Control
regulations and requirements, including those addressing the configuration of
seating elements.
      (5)   Process.
         A.   Applications for outdoor dining areas shall be submitted to the
Safety-Service Director and, if the retail food and/or drink establishment
seeks to serve alcohol within the outdoor dining facility, all appropriate
applications and approval steps must first be completed with the Division of
Liquor Control.
         B.   Applications must include a cover letter and numbered/lettered
attachments that include or otherwise address all of the following:
            •   Name and address of the retail food and/or drink establishment
owner making the application ("Applicant"). If the Applicant is a lessee, it
must include in its application the building owner's written permission.
            •   A site plan of the retail food and/or drink establishment and
its proposed outdoor dining facility, in such detail as to identify:
boundaries, distances, entrances into the retail food and/or drink
establishment, any delineated boundary area, and adjacent building entrances;
property lines, sidewalk width and all surface obstructions within 15 feet of
the outdoor dining area (e.g. brick landscaping walls, fire hydrants,
streetlights, parking meters, trees, tree grates, etc.); width and length of
the outdoor dining area, approximate location of tables and chairs, the
delineated boundary (if serving alcohol), with details showing specifications,
materials, and conformity to the design guidelines set forth herein.
            •   Evidence that the outdoor dining area is in accordance with the
City of Galion's master zoning plan or map and design review guidelines.
         C.   The City of Galion is not obligated to approve submitted
applications and may decline the same for any reason.
         D.   Each approved application will be valid for one (1) year use of
an outdoor dining area. Renewals may be granted administratively by the City of
Galion Code Inspector.
         E.   The City of Galion reserves the right to revoke its permission
for outdoor dining areas once granted, if the area fails to meet the standards
under Ohio law, these policies and procedures, or adhere to the representations
made in the application. As such, the City reserves unto itself the right to
conduct any necessary review of outdoor dining areas prior to making any
renewal determinations.
   (d)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   Tables and chairs must be comprised of metal or wood. Likewise,
planter style and materials must complement the storefront. No plastic tables
or chairs are permitted.
      (2)   Retail food and/or drink establishments serving alcohol in the
public right of way must clearly delineate the entire outdoor dining area with
a boundary that is permanent (not easily movable), and the bounded area is
contiguous to the premises for which the Division of Liquor Control has issued
an appropriate liquor permit.
         A.   The delineating boundary must be in the form of either (i) a
fence that is 36 inches in height or (ii) appropriately arranged planters.
Whichever form taken, the delineated boundary must encompass the entire outdoor
dining area.
         B.   If using a fence, its material must be either historically
appropriate wrought iron or steel made to resemble historically appropriate
wrought iron. There must be no more than one (1) fence gate along the boundary
that allows for movement by patrons of the outdoor dining area.
         C.   If using planters, the delineated boundary shall have a permanent
appearance and application, as well as a clearly defined entrance.
         D.   The delineated boundary materials may be removed on a seasonal
basis (i.e. deconstruct the area during the colder months or during such
special events or maintenance activities as the City may require). In such
cases, the retail food and/or drink establishment must adhere to requirements
set forth by the Division of Liquor Control. The City acknowledges that the
regular cycle of construction of deconstruction of boundary materials
necessarily involves the parallel process of the retail food and/or drink
establishment business applying to the Ohio Department of Commerce for
expansion/diminution under liquor permits each year.
      (3)   Retail food and/or drink establishments must keep at least one (1)
durable, covered, and appropriately sized rubbish container within the outdoor
dining area, and their staff are solely responsible for bussing tables and
general clean-up.
      (4)   Placement of outdoor furniture, planters, and/or fencing on the
sidewalk must conform to all federal ,state, and local laws and regulations,
including but not limited to the Americans with Disabilities Act and all
relevant guidelines and procedures of the Division of Liquor Control.
      (5)   Umbrellas may be permitted under circumstances where the umbrellas,
when raised, do not interfere with pedestrian traffic or other features within
the public right of way. Umbrellas shall not depict any advertising, including
graphics, logos, or names. Umbrellas are not to be used in any area of an
outdoor dining area where an awning is in place.
      (6)   The outdoor furniture, planters, and /or fencing cannot have a
substantially adverse impact on the use, enjoyment, or property values of
adjoining properties.
   (e)   Additional Considerations if Serving Alcohol.
      (1)   Retail food and/or drink establishments with a valid on-premises
liquor permit within the Uptowne District may serve alcohol within approved
outdoor dining areas. Sale of alcohol shall be for on premises consumption
only.
      (2)   Site plan information submitted to the City of Galion for outdoor
dining areas must be identical to any such plans submitted to the Ohio
Department of Commerce, Division on Liquor Control and such plans must be
approved by said Division and the City.
      (3)   Alcohol must not be removed from the clearly delineated outdoor
dining area.

1163.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these regulations is to provide for planned unit development
(PUD) within the City of Galion, in order to achieve:
   (a)   A greater choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and densities within a single development.
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more efficiency in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services.
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns.
   (d)   A more efficient use of land resulting in substantial savings through
shorter utilities and streets.
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use, density,
transportation, and community facilities objectives of the City.

(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.02 DEFINITION.
   "Planned Unit Development", or "PUD", shall mean an area of land in which a
variety of housing types and/or subordinate commercial facilities are
accommodated in a planned environment under more flexible standards, such as
lot sizes and setbacks, than those restrictions that would normally apply under
these regulations. The approval of such development contains requirements in
addition to those of the standard zoning districts, such as building design
principles, and landscaping plans.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.03 PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   Permitted uses within the R, LC and IP Districts may be combined in the PUD
District, provided that the proposed locations of non-residential uses are
compatible with the design of the overall tract, will not adversely impact
adjacent property, and that the location of such uses are specified in the
preliminary and final development plans.
   The amount of land devoted to non-residential uses in a planned unit
development combining residential and non-residential components shall require
approval by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
 
1163.04 PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land proposed to be developed in a single PUD
District shall be a minimum of ten (10) acres. This requirement may be waived
by the Planning Commission if all property abutting the subject tract is
platted and/or developed.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.05 COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the gross land area developed in any
planned unit development project shall be reserved for common open space and/or
recreational facilities. Such common open space shall be:
   (a)   Dedicated to a homeowner's association who shall have title to the
land which shall be retained as common open space. The legal Chapters relating
to the organization of the homeowner's association shall be subject to review
and approval by the Planning Commission and shall provide adequate provisions
for the perpetual care and maintenance of all such common areas; or,
   (b)   Dedicated to the City for parks, open space, or the site of schools or
other related public facilities. All land so dedicated to the City shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Planning Commission; or,
   (c)   Some combination of subsections (a) and (b).
   Public utility and similar easements and rights-of-way for watercourses or
other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space dedication
unless such land or right-of-way is usable as a bikeway, trail or similar
facility and has been approved by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.06 UTILITIES.
   All electrical, telephone, cable television, and similar utility
transmission and distribution lines shall be located underground.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.07 ARRANGEMENT OF NON-RESIDENTIAL USES AND PARKING.
   When development in the PUD District includes non-residential uses,
buildings shall be planned having common parking areas and common ingress and
egress points, in order to reduce traffic congestion and mitigate potential
conflict points. Planting screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter
of such areas where they are adjacent to properties zoned for single family
residential use. Parking areas shall be designed so as to discourage single,
large, unbroken paved lots, and shall encourage smaller defined parking areas
within the total parking system. Such defined parking areas should be
delineated and accented by landscaped areas.
   Service, delivery, and loading areas shall be, to the maximum possible
extent, located to the rear of structures, and screened from view by
landscaping.
   The plan of projects developed in the PUD District shall provide for the
integrated and harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly
arranged facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such
other features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project
attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding
areas.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.08 RESIDENTIAL DENSITY.
   The City of Galion is prepared to accept a higher density in undeveloped
areas than that reflected by current zoning, provided the developer can utilize
planned unit development techniques to demonstrate that any increment of public
cost clearly attributable to increased densities will be compensated for by the
private amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of
development.
   The overall maximum density of the residential portions of the entire
planned unit development shall be consistent with the most previous zoning
classification in which the tract was located. The calculation of such density
shall be based on the number of proposed dwelling units divided by the area of
the site designated for residential use, excluding streets, rights-of-way and
parking areas.
   Notwithstanding the above, individual portions of the planned unit
development may be developed at a higher residential density, provided the
overall density meets the requirements above. In such cases, the resulting
undeveloped land may be utilized as common open space.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.09 PRIVATE ROADS.
   Private roads or streets as a common easement may be used in the PUD
District to provide internal circulation to clustered lots and/or individual
residential structures in residential planned unit developments in accordance
with the following requirements:
   (a)   The easement shall not be counted as required open space.
   (b)   The road or street is approved as part of the subdivision plat as the
most appropriate form of access to lots and/or structures
   (c)   Private roads shall not be used to provide access to non-residential
areas or as through streets.
      (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)

   Ten (10) copies of the completed application and Preliminary Development
Plan shall be submitted to the Code Inspector at least sixteen (16) working
days prior to the Planning Commission's next scheduled meeting. Failure to
submit a complete application shall result in a refusal of acceptance. The Code
Inspector shall transmit the complete application package to the Planning
Commission and other parties as deemed appropriate for review and comment.
   A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Commission not more than
sixty (60) days from the date of acceptance of the application package. The
notification requirements for such hearing shall be as set forth in Section
 1113.05 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
 
1163.14 ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION ON PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Within thirty-five (35) days after the public hearing held by the Planning
Commission, the Commission shall make a recommendation to City Council,
following the procedures as cited in Section
1113.05 of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.15 CRITERIA FOR RECOMMENDATIONS BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Before making its recommendation as required in Section
1163.14, the Planning Commission shall determine whether the facts submitted
with the application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
   (a)   Each individual part of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, and the uses proposed will
not impose undue adverse impacts on adjacent uses, but will have a beneficial
effect which could not be achieved under standard district regulations.
   (b)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate volumes of
traffic which would overload the street network outside the development.
   (c)   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the proposed
locations.
   (d)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by the
design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan.
   (e)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
   (f)   The existing and proposed public services are adequate for the
population densities and uses proposed, and in conformance with capital
improvements planned for the area.
   In making its recommendation, the Planning Commission may seek the
assistance and input of outside consultants and/or experts procured for that
purpose. All costs associated with such input shall be paid by the applicant
for the PUD zoning.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1163.16  ACTION BY CITY COUNCIL.
   Upon receipt of the recommendation by the Commission, City Council shall
review and take action on the application, following the procedures specified

   Not later than twelve (12) months from the approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan, the developer shall submit ten (10) copies of the Final
Development Plan to the Code Inspector. The Final Development Plan shall be in
general conformance with the Preliminary Development Plan. Failure to submit a
Final Development Plan within the specified time period shall render the
approved Preliminary Development Plan and the rezoning of the property null and
void and the land shall revert to the zoning district in which it was located
prior to the amendment.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)

CHAPTER 1167
(RCO) Riparian Corridor Overlay District
1167.01   Purpose.
1167.02   Boundaries.
1167.03   Permitted uses.
1167.04   Development standards.
1167.01 PURPOSE.
   It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams and other natural
watercourses contributes to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of
the City. The City of Galion therefore declares the preservation and
conservation of these riparian corridors to be a public purpose.
   It is the intent of the RCO District to:
   (a)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of
flood waters, and regulating base flood flows, and
   (b)   Stabilize the banks of watercourses so as to reduce bank erosion, and
   (c)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling and transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter the
watercourse, and
   (d)   Provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation, and
   (e)   Benefit the City economically by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions to protect
structures and property located adjacent to the watercourse.
   The RCO District is an overlay zoning district. This means that the
underlying district standards and requirements shall apply in addition to the
following regulations and requirements. The RCO District may also be utilized
over the FP (Flood Plain) District. In such cases, the property would be
subject to the requirements and standards of both the RCO and FP Districts.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1167.02 BOUNDARIES.
   The Riparian Corridor Overlay (RCO) District shall consist of areas fifty
(50) feet from and parallel to the ordinary high water mark along banks of the
watercourse away from the stream landward to a line parallel to the ordinary
high water mark.
   The "ordinary high water mark" is defined as the line between upland and
bottomland which persists through successive changes in water level, below
which the presence and action of the water is so common or recurrent that the
character of the land is marked distinctly from the upland, and is apparent in
the soil itself and/or the configuration of the surface of the soil and
vegetation.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1167.03 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Permitted and conditional uses as specified in the underlying base
district(s), subject to the requirements and standards of this Chapter.
   (b)   Passive private or public recreational uses such as fishing, walking
and hiking, bird watching, etc. No public easement over such property is hereby
created.
   (c)   Selective harvesting of timber, provided not more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the tree crown cover within the portion of the individual land
owner's parcel within the RCO District is removed and trees in the immediate
vicinity are not harvested at the same time.
   (d)   Notwithstanding the above, the removal of individual trees that are
diseased or in danger of falling and causing damage to structures or causing
blockage to the stream.
   (e)   Stream crossing structures located not less than 1,000 feet from any
existing stream crossing, provided the plans for such structures are approved
by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1167.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Construction of principal or accessory structures and changing of
topography, including but not limited to grading, excavating and filling, is
prohibited.
   (b)   No drilling, dredging or dumping of soil, spoil, liquid or solid
material shall be permitted.
   (c)   The creation of new impervious surfaces is prohibited, unless within a
public right-of-way or approved private street constructed as part of a
subdivision.
   (d)   No discharge is permitted into any public or private sewer, drain,
tile or stream, or onto the ground of any liquids or materials which, because
of their toxic properties or temperatures when discharged, would contaminate
groundwater or stream. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA)
standards shall apply and be met in making a determination as to the propriety
of the discharge. Discharges expressly permitted by the OEPA are not restricted
by this Section.
   (e)   The natural vegetation within the Riparian Corridor Overlay District
shall remain undisturbed except for the removal of noxious weeds as otherwise
permitted under the Ohio Revised Code Chapters 5579 and 5589, subject to the
activities referenced above in subsection (b) above.
   (f)   In addition to the standards above, the requirements of the Flood
Plain Overlay (FP) District shall apply.

1177.02   Tree preservation.
1177.03   Landscape screening.
1177.04   Landscape materials used as buffers.
1177.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these landscaping requirements is to promote and protect the
public health, safety and welfare through the promotion of environmental
sustainability by recognizing the vital importance of tree growth as an
integral part of the ecological system. It is further the purpose of this
Section to specifically encourage the preservation and replacement of major
trees removed in the course of land development, to promote the proper
utilization of landscaping as a buffer between particular land uses, and to
minimize noise, air and/or visual pollution and artificial light glare.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1177.02 TREE PRESERVATION.
   When preparing and reviewing subdivision plans and preliminary and final
development plans, good faith effort shall be made to preserve natural
vegetation areas. Streets, lots, structures and parking areas should be laid
out to avoid unnecessary destruction of heavily wooded areas or outstanding
tree specimens.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1177.03 LANDSCAPE SCREENING.
   (a)   Screening in Particular Districts. The development standards for
particular districts require the installation of screen or buffer areas of side
or rear yards that are adjacent to districts where residences are permitted
uses. When required by the specific district development standards, such
screening shall consist of walls, landscaped earthen mounds, fences, natural
vegetation or an acceptable combination of these elements. Such areas shall be
a minimum of ten (10) feet wide and contain screening at least seven (7) feet
in height at the time of planting. The use of year-round vegetation, such as
pines or evergreens, is encouraged. Landscaped screening shall have at least
seventy-five percent (75%) opacity during full foliage.
   (b)   Screening of Trash Receptacles. The development standards for
particular zoning districts require the screening of trash receptacles to
effectively screen them from view. In those cases where screening is required,
landscaping can be utilized to meet this requirement, provided the standards
for such landscaping meet the requirements of this Section.
   (c)   Maintenance of Shrubbery and Hedges. In any district, no shrubbery,
hedge and/or other vegetation shall be planted, in such a manner that any
portion of growth extends beyond the property line. The owner or occupant of
property on which there is shrubbery, hedges, trees and/or other vegetation
located so as to affect the vision of drivers on adjacent streets shall keep
such vegetation trimmed to a maximum of thirty (30) inches in height, and keep
trees trimmed so as to avoid covering or obscuring of traffic visibility or
traffic control signals.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)

intersections where the clear wood requirement shall be eight (8) feet. A
minimum of ten (10) feet overall height, or a minimum caliper (trunk diameter
as measured six inches above the ground) of at least two (2) inches immediately
after planting shall be required. Trees of undesirable species, as cited in
subsection (b) below, are prohibited.
   (b)   In meeting the planting and maintenance requirements of this
Ordinance, the following species of trees shall be considered undesirable
species, and shall not be utilized.
      (1)   Box-Elder (Acer negundo)

NOTES / TABLE I:
•   For the purposes of calculating the number of permitted signs, "frontage"
shall be interpreted as frontage on a publicly dedicated and improved street.
Businesses which abut public alleys or driveways may place one (1) additional
sign facing said alley or driveway.
•   Plans for signage in the HC and PUD Districts must be submitted with the
required Development Plan; the Planning Commission may impose additional
requirements.
•   In all districts where so permitted, uses having drive-through facilities
shall submit a specific site plan for signage, showing the type, size and
location of all permanent signs, including directional signs and menu boards.
Such site plan shall be subject to the review and approval of the Planning
Commission.
•   Buildings or developments with multiple business occupants, i.e., shopping
centers, shall be permitted one (1) joint identification sign per street
frontage in addition to signage permitted above. If such sign is a freestanding
sign, no individual business within such building or development shall use a
separate freestanding sign.
•   In addition to the designated number of permitted signs, nonresidential
uses along arterial or collector highways within the HS, GC, HC and IP
Districts shall be allowed a maximum of two (2) directional signs, each not
exceeding two (2) square feet in area. Such directional signs shall clearly be
for the purpose of designating entrances and/or exits and directing customers
to the internal circulation network on the site.
•   The Galion Community Hospital has special and unique needs for signage
directly related to its role as a regional provider of health and safety
functions. These needs are likely to be different and exceed those of other
business, public and institutional uses. Any new signs requested by the Galion
Community Hospital shall be accompanied by a written explanation of why the
specific request is necessary for the delivery of services to the community,
and how the proposed sign(s) is/are integrated with the existing signage
system. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to approve the
proposed signs after review of the submittal.

   For the purposes of this Chapter, the measurement of sign area shall comply
with the following standards:
   (a)   Sign area shall include the face of all the display area of the sign
not including bracing, framing and structural supports of the sign, unless such
support members are made part of the message or face of the design.
   (b)   Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces of
the sign shall be included in determining the area of the sign, unless one of
the following exceptions apply:
      (1)   Two (2) display faces join back-to-back and parallel to each other
and not more than twelve inches (12") apart,
      (2)   The sign is marquee, canopy or awning sign subject to the
requirements of Section
1181.08(b).
In such cases, the area of the sign shall be considered as one (1) of the two
(2) sign faces.
   (c)   For spherical signs, the sphere shall be bisected by an imaginary line
through the center of the sphere, and the surface area of the half sphere shall
be counted as the sign face. For cubical signs, the area of all display faces
shall be included in determining the area of the sign.
   (d)   The area of the letters, numbers or emblems mounted directly on a
building wall or wall extension shall be computed by enclosing the entire word
or words formed by such letters, numbers or emblems with the smallest single
continuous perimeter consisting of rectangular or series of rectangles, and
determining the area within such perimeter.
   (e)   The height of the sign shall be measured from the elevation of the
ground at the point which the base of the sign meets the ground, to the highest
point on the sign.

nonconforming sign which shall terminate by abandonment when any of the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   When the sign is associated with an abandoned use.
      (2)   When the sign remains after the termination of a business. A

characteristics of the site. To the maximum extent possible, development shall
be located so as to:
   •    Preserve the natural features of the site,
   •    Avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and
   •    Minimize negative impacts on and alteration of natural features.
   The following specific areas should be preserved as undeveloped open space,
to the extent consistent with reasonable utilization of the land:
   (a)   Wetlands, as defined in Section 404, Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, subject to field verification by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, or other agency authorized to make such determination;
   (b)   Lands subject to flooding, pursuant to Section
1193.03 below;
   (c)   Slopes in excess of fifteen percent (15%) unless appropriate
engineering methods are employed to address erosion, stability and resident
safety;
   (d)   Historically significant structures and/or sites as listed, or
eligible for inclusion, on the National Register of Historic Places;
      (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1193.03 LAND NOT SUITED FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed for subdivision
development is unsuitable due to flooding, poor drainage, topography,
inadequate public facilities, and/or other condition that may be detrimental to
the general health, safety or welfare of the public, and if it is determined
that the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed, the Planning
Commission shall not approve such subdivision unless adequate methods are
proposed by the Owner/Developer for alleviating the problems that would be
created by development of the land, subject to the approval of the City
Engineer.
   (a)   Land Subject to Flooding. The subdivision of lands within areas
subject to flooding shall be subject to the standards and regulations of
Chapter
1335 of the Codified Ordinances, and shall, in addition, be subject to the
following requirements:
      (1)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if the proposed
subdivision development will, individually or collectively, significantly
increase flood flows, heights or damages.
      (2)   No subdivision, or part thereof, shall be approved which would
substantially affect the storage capacity of the flood plain.
      (3)   Buildings or structures shall not be permitted in floodway areas.
Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway if the sites or
structures are elevated to such height that the lowest floor of the structure
is least one (1) foot above the 100-year base flood elevation, as established
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and/or other authorized
agency, in a flood study or report approved by the City. Required fill areas
must extend fifteen (15) feet beyond the limits of the structure(s).
      (4)   When the Planning Commission determines that only part of a
proposed plat can be developed in compliance with these requirements, it shall
limit development to only that portion,
      (5)   The Planning Commission may attach other reasonable conditions as
is appropriate to the approval of plats within areas subject to flooding. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to, requirement for the
construction of dikes, levees or other similar measures, or flood proofing of
structures, as recommended by the City Engineer.
         (Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1193.04 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   (a)   The Owner/Developer shall use adequate measures to minimize erosion
and its impacts during subdivision construction activity. The City Engineer
shall have the authority to require detailed erosion and sedimentation plans be
submitted if it is determined that the size and/or scale of the proposed
subdivision warrants such action. Generally, such a plan shall be required for,
but not limited to, major subdivisions where the total area of the subdivision
is more than one (1) acre in size, or if the subdivision is located where
average slope exceeds five percent (5%). In addition, the Mayor shall have the
authority to require erosion and sedimentation plans for any established lot
where development is proposed to occur.
   (b)   Erosion and sedimentation plans shall be prepared by a Professional
Engineer, and indicate the techniques to be used to control erosion both during
construction and permanently, and include a schedule for installing same.
Erosion control plans shall be based on the control of erosion on-site, with
the objective of eliminating or minimizing erosion and sedimentation impacts
off-site. Techniques, devices and/or measures used shall be reviewed and
approved by the City Engineer.
   (c)   All erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be in place at the
start of construction activity.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1193.05 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   Construction Site Runoff Control. The Owner/Developer shall use
adequate measures to minimize erosion and other negative water quality impacts
as a result of construction and development activity. The Planning Commission
shall have the authority to require a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan in
those cases where the scope and scale of the development warrants, as
recommended by the City Engineer. The plan shall be prepared by a Professional
Engineer or other certified professional and shall be developed utilizing
current industry standards and effective Best Management Practices (BMPs). As
part of the plan, the Owner/Developer shall install, inspect and keep records
of inspection, and maintain BMPs throughout the duration of the permit. The
City may inspect the construction site for compliance with the Storm Water
Pollution Prevention Plan and, if found lacking, may issue a permit violation,
stop work order, fine or other measure to ensure compliance.
   (b)   Post Construction Runoff Control. Post construction runoff control
shall be addressed in the design phase of proposed subdivisions. Both
structural and nonstructural post construction BMPs will be considered. Use of
riparian setbacks, green space preservation, porous pavements, water quality
swales and grass filter strips are a few methods to be considered. Specific
sites within the proposed subdivision may be inspected for compliance and, if
found lacking, an inspector may issue a permit violation, stop work order, or
fine to ensure compliance. Fines as defined by separate ordinance may be levied
by the City as soon as one (1) week after notification of violation.
   (c)   Storm Water Drainage.
      (1)   General.  No subdivision plan or plat shall be approved that does
not make adequate provision for storm water runoff and flood waters. The
Planning Commission shall have the authority to deny subdivision approval for
areas of extremely poor drainage, including subdivisions in areas dominated by
hydric soils. In any subdivision, the storm drainage system shall be separate
and independent of any sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Preservation of Natural Drainage Courses. The flow of all existing
drainage courses, including underground drainage systems, shall not be impeded.
Such underground systems, including farm field tile systems, shall be
identified and mapped as part of the preliminary plan.
         No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or
structures shall be located unless provision is made for the flow of storm
runoff and/or surface water. An easement shall be provided on both sides of the
existing surface drainage course adequate for the purpose of future widening,
deepening, enclosing or otherwise improving said drainage course. If such
drainage course crosses private property, easements must be obtained by the
Owner/Developer for construction and future maintenance. These easements must
be shown on the Construction Plans, including the volume and page number of the
recorded easement.
      (3)   Outlets. No subdivision plan or plat shall be approved by the
Planning Commission unless an adequate outlet for storm water, as shown on the
plan or plat, is approved by the City Engineer. Generally it will be necessary
to pipe storm water to an adequate watercourse, stream or existing storm system
which has the capacity to accommodate the flow, or to utilize acceptable on-
site water retention methods adequate to minimize excessive off-site storm
water flows.
      (4)   Submittal Data. Culverts and other components of storm water
conveyance systems that cross streets or roadways shall be designed so as to
adequately address the ten (10) year storm under residential streets and the
fifty (50) year storm under collector and arterial streets. The City Engineer
may require the Owner/Developer to pay for an analysis of the existing storm
water system to determine how best to connect the proposed development to the
existing system or any required improvements downstream so as not to overload
the system. The post development runoff rate may not exceed the predevelopment
runoff rate as determined by the 100 year storm event.
   (d)   Culverts. All culverts utilized in subdivisions shall have the
appropriate headwalls and/or other structures and improvements to protect the
facility.
   (e)   Open Drainage Channels. The determination as to whether a specific
drainage course shall be enclosed or open shall be made by the City Engineer.
In those cases where an open channel is determined to be acceptable, the cross
section and profile of the open channel and its banks shall be determined by
the City Engineer.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
1193.06 STREETS.
   (a)   General. All streets shall be designed with appropriate regard for
topography, streams, wooded areas, soils, geologic limitations and natural
features. Roadways shall further be designed to permit efficient drainage and
utility systems layouts while providing safe and convenient access to property.
   (b)   Classification, Street Widths and Street Grades. The arrangement and
classification of all streets in newly developed areas shall conform to the
Thoroughfare Plan. For streets not indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan, the
arrangement shall provide for appropriate extensions of existing streets. The
Planning Commission shall make the final determination as to the classification
of any new street, based on the potential development of the site, and its
potential traffic volume, expressed in ADT (Average Daily Traffic), the
character of the surrounding area, and the Thoroughfare Plan. Rights-of-way,
pavement widths and street grades shall be as specified in Appendix A, which is
hereby made a part of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2009-85. Passed 12-8-09.)
   (c)    Alignment.
      (1)    The street pattern shall make provision for the continuance of
streets into adjoining areas and for the connection to existing rights-of-way
in adjacent areas.
      (2)    If a subdivision adjoins or contains an existing or proposed
arterial or major collector street, direct access points to such street shall
be minimized. The Planning Commission may require marginal access streets or
reverse frontage with a planting strip of a minimum width of twenty (20) feet
on the rear of those lots abutting the street, and no vehicular access across
the strip.
      (3)    If a subdivision adjoins an existing or proposed arterial or major
collector street, the Planning Commission may require drainage improvements and
the construction of separate turn lanes and/or traffic signals on such streets
into the proposed subdivision.
      (4)    Local streets shall be laid out so as to discourage use by through
traffic.
      (5)    Streets shall intersect one another at ninety (90) degrees, or as
near to ninety (90) degrees as possible, but in no case less than seventy-five
(75) degrees. The intersecting street must remain within these degree
parameters for a distance of not less than one-hundred feet (100') from the
intersection.
      (6)    Street jogs shall be discouraged. Where such jogs are unavoidable,
in no case shall the centerlines be offset by less than 125 feet.
      (7)    Half width streets shall be prohibited.
         (Ord. 2020-54. Passed 9-8-20.)
   (d)   Dedication. The necessary rights-of-way for widening or extension of
all thoroughfares, shall be dedicated to public use. When a subdivision fronts
on an existing City street, or County or township road, dedication shall be
made to the proper authority so as to meet the requirements of the table in
Appendix A.
   (e)   Blocks. Blocks shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length except where
specific topographic conditions require a greater length.
   (f)   Street Names. The names of new streets shall not duplicate names of
existing dedicated streets except that new streets which are extensions of
existing streets shall bear the names of such existing streets. All new
roadways shall be named according to the following manner:
 
DIRECTION               CUL-DE-SACS ALL OTHER STREETS
North/South             Place       Avenue

require the following:
      (1)   The dedication to the public of part or all of the proposed site
and/or
      (2)   Reservation of the site for a period of up to three (3) years to
enable acquisition by the appropriate agency or entity.
   (b)   Minimum Dedication Requirements. In all subdivisions or developments
which result in additional dwelling units within the City, the Owner/Developer
shall be required to dedicate land to public sites and open space without
compensation, or to pay an amount equal to the value as defined in Section
subsection (d) below, to the City of Galion for the purpose of developing
public sites and open space of benefit to the residents of said subdivision.
The amount of land to be dedicated by the Owner/Developer shall be determined
according to the following formula:
Acres of Land for Dedication = Total Population X .005
   The total population of a subdivision will be calculated by determining a
population factor for each dwelling unit in the subdivision (see below) and
adding all population factors for dwelling units in the subdivision
   The population for each dwelling unit shall be as follows:
      Single-Family Dwelling         3.0
      One Bedroom Multiple Family      1.5
      Two Bedroom Multiple Family      2.0

with the Parks and Recreation Committee of City Council may modify the
requirements as specified above when the Owner/Developer has shown that at
least one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The development will house a population substantially lower than
that established above.
      (2)   The development will have a uncommon low need for parks and
recreation services.
      (3)   The unique or special characteristics of the project that justify
modification of these requirements can be reasonably expected to continue for
the life of the project.
   (d)   Fee in Lieu of Dedication. The Planning Commission shall determine if
land proposed for public sites and/or open space is suitable and desirable for
such purpose. If it is determined that the land is not suitable for such
purposes, the Owner/Developer shall pay a fee-in-lieu of land dedication to the
City, for the express purposes of developing other sites or open spaces of
benefit to the future residents of the subdivision. The amount of such fee
shall be $200 for each dwelling unit within the subdivision.
   (e)   Private Recreational Areas. In lieu of the requirements of subsection
(b) and (d) above, the Owner/Developer may devote not less than the acreage
required in subsection (b) above to a private recreation area for the use of
the occupants of the subdivision. The recreation area must be of suitable size
for recreational purposes, as determined by the Planning Commission. The Owner/
Developer must present a plan for development and perpetual maintenance of the
site proposed, and such plan must be reviewed and approved by the Planning
Commission. The Owner/Developer shall also provide security to ensure
development and maintenance of the site in the form of a bond, deposit of funds
or other form satisfactory to the Planning Commission.

consistent with the purposes and guidelines of this Chapter.
   (b)   Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be filed with

specified in Sections
1311.09 and
1311.10 below.
   (d)   In determining the appropriateness of a specific environmental change,
the Board may conduct a separate public meeting on the project and/or solicit

for the purposes of this Section.
(Ord. 2003-39. Passed 4-22-03.)
1311.09 CRITERIA OF EVALUATION OF APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF DESIGN
APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed environmental change,
including landscaping or exterior signage, the respective Design Review Board
shall consider the following:
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose, or placed in a new
use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site.
   (b)   The proposed change shall respect the visual and functional components
of the building and its site, including but not limited to, building height,
massing and proportion, roof shape and slope, landscape design, lighting,
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and signage.
   (c)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a contributing
building, structure, site and/or its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural or
environmental features should be avoided when possible.
   (d)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   (e)   If changes which may have taken place in the course of time within the
history and development of a building, structure or site and/or its
environment, and if these changes are deemed to have acquired significance,
then this significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (f)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be preserved where
possible and treated with sensitivity.
   (g)   Significant architectural features which have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or
replacement of architectural features should be based on accurate duplication
of the feature, and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or availability of
different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (h)   The surface cleaning of masonry structures shall be undertaken with
methods designed to minimize damage to historic building materials.
Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building
materials should be avoided.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired. Additions to the least significant and least visible of
contributing properties should be given priority over other designs.
      (Ord. 2003-39. Passed 4-22-03.)
1311.10 ADDITIONAL DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   In addition to the design criteria adopted in
1311.09 hereof, each Design Review Board established under
1131.04 shall adopt specific guidelines for each district to put into effect
the standards adopted in
1311.09 and which will be fully consistent with the same. Once duly adopted,
such guidelines will have full force and effect to regulate the issuance of
Certificates of Appropriateness under
1311.07.
   (b)   Each Board shall review its specific guidelines no less frequently
than every four (4) years to consider changes in available materials, current
federal or state review standards, and up-to-date techniques in building
renovation and restoration.
   (c)   Until such time as the City of Galion Design Review Board and Harding
Way West Design Review Board adopt guidelines for Design Review Districts #1,
#2, and #3 pursuant to the authority given them under this ordinance, the
Additional Design Criteria listed in the former
1311.10 shall continue in effect for any district in which such guidelines have
not been so adopted.
(Ord. 2018-5. Passed 3-13-18.)
1311.11 DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES.
   (a)   In cases where an applicant applies for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to demolish a structure with the Design Review District, the
Design Review Board shall grant the demolition and issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness if the Board finds, based upon evidence submitted by the
applicant, that the structure contains no features of architectural or
historical significance to the character of individual District within which it
is located.
   (b)   In cases where an applicant applies for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to demolish a structure within the Design Review District which
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Design Review Board
shall grant the demolition and issue a Certificate of Appropriateness only if
the Board finds, based upon evidence submitted by the applicant and based upon
a case-by-case determination, that the public interests in preserving a
structure containing features of architectural and historical significance is
outweighed by a substantial economic hardship to the applicant.
   (c)   In cases where the applicant applies for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to demolish a structure within the Design Review District which
is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but contains
features of architectural and historical significance to the character of the
District within which it is located, the Board may deny such application only
if the Board finds, based upon a case-by-case determination, that such
structure satisfies all the eligibility requirements to be listed on the
National Register of Historic Places and that the applicant will not suffer a
substantial economic hardship by reason of such denial. However, prior to
making any decision, the Board may impose a waiting period of at least thirty
(30) days, but not to exceed three (3) months for the purposes described in (f)
below.
   (d)   In cases where an applicant applies for a Certificate of
Appropriateness to demolish a structure within the Design Review District which
contains features of architectural and historical significance to the character
of the District within which it is located, but the Design Review Board finds,
based upon evidence submitted by the applicant, that structure fails to meet
the eligibility requirements to be listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, the Board shall grant such application. However, prior to making any
decision, the Board may impose a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days,
but not to exceed three (3) months, for the purposes described in (f) below.
   (e)   To establish the existence of a substantial economic hardship, an
applicant has the burden of proving one or more of the following:
      (1)   Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness to demolish the
structure will result in a substantial reduction in the economic value of the
property;
      (2)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property; and/or
      (3)   The property is not able to be sold within the previous two (2)
years as established by testimony and relevant documents showing any real
estate broker or firm engaged to sell the property, the reasonableness of the
price sought by the applicant, and any offers received.
   (f)   When a waiting period is imposed by the Design Review Board, the Board
and the applicant shall meet as requested and undertake meaningful and
continuing discussions in order to find a means of preserving the structure.
During this period, the Board and the applicant shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the structure and the applicant shall
make every reasonable effort to find a demolition alternative for that
structure. If the applicant or a representative fails to meet with the Board at
the time specified, then the Board may deny a Certificate of Appropriateness to
demolish the structure. During such period, the owner of such structure shall
also maintain or mothball the structure to prevent further deterioration.
(Ord. 2003-39. Passed 4-22-03.)
1311.12  MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance
or repair of any property within the Design Review District, provided such work
involves no change in material, design, texture, color or exterior appearance;
nor shall anything in this Chapter be construed to prevent any change,
including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any
feature which by order of the Zoning and Building Department is required for
the public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or dangerous condition.
(Ord. 2003-39. Passed 4-22-03.)

Design Review Board, which application shall be accompanied by a full and

   There is hereby adopted and established a code relating to dangerous
buildings and the vacating, repairing and demolishing thereof, and the
penalizing of certain acts in relation thereto.
(Ord. 71-4333. Passed 7-20-71.)
1331.02 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, "dangerous buildings" means:

are so out of plumb, level or original position as to be unable to
satisfactorily perform their intended structural function;
   (b)   Buildings which are so dilapidated, decayed or overloaded as to be
unable to provide the basic elements of shelter or safety required for human
habitation;
   (c)   Buildings which constitute a fire hazard because of their
construction, exposure or lack of maintenance;
   (d)   Buildings which are so unsanitary as to constitute a health hazard to
their occupants or to the public;
   (e)   Buildings which have been damaged to an extent of fifty percent (50%)
or more of their replacement value.
      (Ord. 71-4333. Passed 7-20-71.)

   All dangerous buildings as defined in Section
1331.02 are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be vacated,
repaired or demolished as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 71-4333. Passed 7-20-71.)
1331.04 INSPECTION; RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Mayor or his assistants are authorized and directed to make inspection
of any building within the City to determine whether it is a dangerous building
within the terms of Section
1331.02. For the purpose of making such inspection and upon showing appropriate
identification, the Mayor or his assistants are authorized to enter, examine
and survey at any reasonable hour all buildings existing in the City. The
owner, occupant or person in charge of any building, upon being shown proper
identification, shall give the Mayor or his assistants free access to the
building at any reasonable hour for the purpose of inspection.
(Ord. 71-4333. Passed 7-20-71.)
1331.05 STANDARDS FOR REPAIR, VACATION OR DEMOLITION.
   The following standards shall be followed in substance by the Mayor in
ordering repair, vacation or demolition of a dangerous building:
   (a)   If the building is in such condition as to make it dangerous to the
health or safety of its occupants, it shall be ordered to be immediately
vacated.
   (b)   If the building can reasonably be repaired so it will no longer
violate the terms of this chapter, it shall be ordered repaired.
   (c)   The building shall be ordered demolished if:
      (1)   It is fifty percent or more damaged or decayed or deteriorated from
its original structure;
      (2)   It cannot be repaired so that it no longer violates the terms of
this chapter; or

in writing, the owner, occupant, lessee, mortgagee, agent and all other persons
having an interest in the property, as shown by County records, as to what
action is required to be taken under Section
1331.05. The notice shall set forth a description of the building, a statement
of the particulars which make it a dangerous building and, if it is to be

1335.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Galion, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Galion has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
         generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development    of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Galion as identified in Section
1335.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Galion.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Crawford County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both effective October 19, 2023.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: None.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Galion as required by Section
1335.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
         Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Office of the Building Inspector, 115 Harding
Way East, Galion, Ohio, 44833.
   
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Galion, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2023-
65. Passed 9-26-23.)

hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Galion's historic preservation program and Design Review Board,
which program is certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory flood way, the effective base flood
elevations, or the Special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home
park does not include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display
for sale of manufactured homes.
   (z)   Mean sea level: For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program,
the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which
base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   (aa)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (bb)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
City of Galion and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [June 19, 1985] and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (cc)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but
is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau,
society, council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does
not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (dd)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (hh)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (ii)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (ll)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (mm)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (nn)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2023-65. Passed 9-26-23.)

$2500.
   (j)   State and Federal Development.
      (1)   Development that is funded, financed, undertaken, or preempted by
state agencies shall comply with minimum NFIP criteria.
      (2)   Before awarding funding or financing or granting a license, permit,
or other authorization for a development that is or is to be located within a
100-year floodplain, a state agency shall require the applicant to demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the agency that the development will comply with minimum
NFIP criteria and any applicable local floodplain management resolution or
ordinance as required by Ohio Revised Code Section 1521.13. This includes, but
is not limited to:
         A.   Development activities in an existing or proposed manufactured
home park that are under the authority of the Ohio Department of Commerce and
subject to the flood damage reduction provisions of the Ohio Administrative
Code Section 4781-12.
         B.   Major utility facilities permitted by the Ohio Power Siting Board
under Section 4906 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         C.   Hazardous waste disposal facilities permitted by the Hazardous

      (3)   Development activities undertaken by a federal agency and which are
subject to Federal Executive Order 11988 - Floodplain Management.
         A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Galion's flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1335.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1335.03(k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Building Inspector
of the City of Galion, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Galion have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Galion's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Galion
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Galion suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Galion has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
 1335.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1335.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and flood way data from a preliminary FIRM or IS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM tlata to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1335.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Galion and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
 1335.04(i)(1)A, items 1 and 3 through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Galion specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1335.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1335.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council hereby appoints the Galion Board of Zoning Appeals as
the Appeals Board to hear and decide appeals and requests for variances arising
under this Ordinance.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Office of the Mayor, 301 Harding Way East, Galion, Ohio, 44833.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1335.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.  
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within twenty-one (21) days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance application shall
transmit it to the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; locations of the floodplain; description of
the variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by the City
Council.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1335.05(d)(3)A through K have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Crawford Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2023-65. Passed 9-26-
23.)

1339.01 TITLE AND SCOPE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property Litter Control Code of
the City. It is strictly limited to the establishment of minimum standards for
the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
structures and buildings within the City, including yard areas immediately
contiguous thereto. No provisions of this chapter shall, in any way, directly
or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right of, any
owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in such
manner and form as they may determine appropriate, consonant with other
applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to obvious visual
problems which may occasion incipient blighting conditions within the City. All
matters of the interior use, occupancy or habitation of any structure or
building within the City are specifically excluded from the provisions of this
chapter.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, and exterior conditions of all premises throughout the City; to fix
certain responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents and managers of the
same as to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to
authorize and establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such
premises; to fix penalties for violations of this chapter; and to provide for
the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use. This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential
for the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   "Deterioration" means the condition or appearance characterized by
holes, breaks, rot, crumbling, cracking, peeling, rusting or other evidence of
physical decay or neglect or lack of maintenance.
   (b)   "Mixed occupancy" means any building containing one or more dwelling
units or rooming units and also having a portion thereof devoted to nondwelling
uses.
   (c)   "Nuisance" means:
      (1)   Any public nuisance known at common law or in equity jurisprudence,
or as provided by the statutes of the State or ordinances of the City;
      (2)   Physical conditions dangerous to human life or detrimental to the
health of persons on or near the premises where the conditions exist;
      (3)   Unsanitary conditions or anything offensive to the senses or
dangerous to health, in violation of this chapter; and
      (4)   Fire hazards.
   (d)   "Owner" means any person who, alone or jointly or severally with
others, has legal or equitable title to any premises, with or without
accompanying actual possession thereof, or has charge, care or control of any
dwelling or dwelling unit, as an owner or an agent of the owner, or as a
fiduciary, including, but not limited to, the executor, the administrator, the
trustee, the receiver or the guardian of the estate or as a mortgagee in
possession, regardless of how such possession was obtained.
   Any real estate company, firm, corporation, broker or salesman having a
listing agreement with the owner of real property for the purpose of the sale
of the same, and not having an additional contractual agreement, oral or
written, to manage or maintain the same during the continuance of such listing
agreement, is specifically exempted from this definition, and does not fall
within the purview of Section
1339.03 establishing maintenance responsibility.
   (e)   "Premises" means a lot, plot or parcel of land, including the
buildings or structures thereon.

1339.04 FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the City various and
several structures, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto, which
are, or may become in the future, deteriorated or defective with respect to
exterior maintenance, or further, that such condition, including but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of
exterior of premises, existence of exterior fire hazards and unsanitary
conditions, constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the City. It is further
found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, the exterior appearance of certain properties have the further
effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating depressed neighborhood
groupings, and that if the same are not curtailed and corrected, the conditions
are likely to grow and spread and necessitate, in time, the expenditure of
large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same, and that by
reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth
of such blight may be prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property
values thereby maintained.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.05 APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential, nonresidential or mixed occupancy building and the land
on which it is situated, used or intended to be used for dwelling, commercial
business or industrial occupancy shall comply with the provisions of this
chapter, whether or not such building shall have been constructed, altered or
repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter, and without regard to
any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy
of the building or premises for the construction or repair of the building, or
for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the
effective date of this chapter. This chapter establishes minimum standards for
the initial and continued occupancy and use of all such structures and does not
replace or modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration or use of the building. Where there is a mixed occupancy,
residential or nonresidential use therein shall be nevertheless regulated by
and subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.06 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other chapter by the City or law of the State, then the
standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the City
or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such other
ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.07 APPEALS BOARD.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals will hear all appeals on the administration of
this chapter.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)
1339.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of any and all provisions of this chapter is placed with the
Mayor and/or his designee, and such person(s), shall carry out and effectuate
all of the provisions herein.
   (a)   Inspection. All buildings and premises within the City are subject to
exterior inspections from time to time by the Mayor and/or his designee.
   (b)   Notice and Appeal.
      (1)   Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is found to
exist, the Mayor and/or his designee shall cause a written notice of such
violation to be served upon the person responsible for the correction thereof.
The notice shall specify the violation committed and shall provide for a
reasonable period of time, not more than sixty days, to correct or abate the
violation. In the event that weather is a major consideration in correcting or
abating a violation, the Mayor and/or his designee may extend the time set out
herein to not more than sixty days immediately following the occurrence of
appropriate weather conditions.
      (2)   Notice may be served personally or by certified mail addressed to
the last known address of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof
at the usual residence of the person to be served. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on the outside front entrance
of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a Final Order as to these
administrative proceedings.
   (c)   Appeal.  
      (1)   Within ten days of the date of service of notice, any person
affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Zoning Board of
Appeals by filing a written request with the Chairman of the Board. The
Chairman of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty days
therefrom, and upon five days notice to the party and the Mayor and/or his
designee, set the matter down for hearing. The Board may sustain, modify or
dismiss, in whole or in part, any action required to correct or abate the
violation set forth in the notice and shall issue an order incorporating its
determinations, and such order shall be a Final Order as to these
administrative proceedings, provided, however, that any order of modification
or dismissal shall be effective for two years following the date of issuance of
such order, and thereafter, the subject matter of such order of modification or
dismissal may be amendable to further inspection, notice and appeal as set
forth herein.
      (2)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Mayor and/or
his designee shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this
chapter, and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants,
or the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent
premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of compelling an
expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare of the community
that might be derived therefrom.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this chapter
shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner, manager or resident from complying with any such other provision,
nor any official of the City from enforcing any such other provision.
(Ord. 87-5636. Passed 7-9-87.)

discontinuance of a business, moving of a business, or which becomes dangerous
to the public safety, or any other event occurs which negates the usefulness of
such sign, shall be removed by the owner within thirty days from the time it
becomes obsolete or dangerous. If such obsolete, dangerous, or otherwise
abandoned sign is not removed within the thirty day period, the City shall

   The owner of all existing and future non-owner occupied dwelling units
located in the City of Galion shall install and maintain smoke detectors and
carbon monoxide (CO) detectors as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-7. Passed 5-26-15.)
1365.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms are defined as follows:
   (a)    "Smoke detector" means a device which is designed to detect the
visible and invisible products of combustion and which is designed to emit an
alarm upon such detection.
   (b)    "Carbon monoxide detector" means a device, which is designed to be
capable of sensing the presence of carbon monoxide.
   (c)    "Sleeping area" is defined as the area or areas of the family living
unit in which the bedrooms or sleeping rooms are located. Where bedrooms or
rooms ordinarily used for sleeping are separated by other use areas, such as
kitchens or living rooms, but not bathrooms or closets, they shall be
considered as separate sleeping areas for the purposes of this section.
(Ord. 2015-7. Passed 5-26-15.)
1365.03 CRITERIA.
   (a)    Criteria for Smoke Detectors.
      (1)    The location and number of smoke detectors required shall be based
upon NFPA 74-1975 as now existing and as from time to time amended hereafter,
captioned "standard for the installation, maintenance and use of household fire
warning systems".
      (2)    There shall be a smoke detector installed:
         A.    Within each story of each required family living unit, including
basements but excluding crawl spaces and unfinished attics;
         B.    Within the immediate vicinity of all sleeping areas. At least
one of these detectors on any floor with sleeping areas shall be of a
tamperproof, enclosed battery variety.
      (3)    No smoke detector shall satisfy the requirements herein unless it
shall bear the label of a nationally recognized testing laboratory.
      (4)    All detectors shall be sensitive to both visible and invisible
products of combustion and shall not be acceptable if such smoke detectors are
sensitive to heat only.
   (b)    Criteria for Carbon Monoxide Detectors.
      (1)    At least one carbon monoxide (CO) detector shall be installed in
the immediate vicinity of the sleeping area, as per manufacturer's
specifications, in any applicable dwelling unit that is heated by fossil fuel
without a detached garage.
      (2)    The carbon monoxide (CO) detectors shall be approved by a
recognized testing agency by the State of Ohio or NFPA and shall be capable of
sensing the presence of carbon monoxide gas and providing a suitable alarm
thereof when current applicable standards for low-level threshold
concentrations of the gas are reached.
      (3)    When bedroom or sleeping areas are not fully enclosed or separated
from other living areas within a living or sleeping unit, the smoke detector
and carbon monoxide (CO) detector shall be installed nearest the area
designated for sleeping, as per the manufacturer's specifications.
   (c)    Alternate Systems.
      (1)    As an alternate to self-contained smoke detectors, an approved
fire detection system may be installed. Each fire detection system shall be
individually approved by the Fire Chief. Where a carbon monoxide (CO) detector
is required, a combination smoke detector / carbon monoxide (CO) detector may
be used provided the unit meets all current codes and standards for each
application and that the detector be tamper-proof in which a long-life battery
pack, if so powered, is sealed within the detector. Such combination detectors
shall be individually approved by the Fire Chief.
         (Ord. 2015-7. Passed 5-26-15.)
1365.04 EQUIPMENT AND INSTALLATION.
   (a)    Equipment and Installation.
      (1)    All devices, combinations of devices and equipment required herein
are to be installed in conformance with the Building Codes adopted by the City
and this section and shall be of a type approved by the Fire Chief. A suitable
type detector, specifically designed and marketed for the hearing impaired,
which is equipped with an additional strobe-light alarm feature, shall be
provided for residents so impaired, as required herein. For the purpose of
installation and maintenance only, the applicable sections of the most current
edition, NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Code, shall be considered accepted
engineering practice.
      (2)    In new residential buildings and existing residential buildings
where major renovations are performed (major renovations is defined as
renovations exceeding more than twenty five (25%) percent of the value of the
structure at the time of renovation), smoke detectors and carbon monoxide (CO)
detectors, if required, shall be wired directly (hard-wired) to the building's
power supply. In existing dwellings, it is preferred that smoke detectors and
carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, if required, be wired directly to the power
supply. However, smoke detectors may be powered by a self-monitoring battery or
operated in a plug-in outlet provided the outlet is not controlled by any
switch other than the main power supply. Any battery powered smoke detectors
required and installed after the effective date of this section shall be of the
tamper-proof type in which the long-life battery packs are sealed within the
detector. Carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, which are not wired directly to the
building's power supply must be operated in a plug-in outlet provided the
outlet is not controlled by any switch other than the main power supply. Carbon
monoxide (CO) detectors with a digital read out are preferred. Single use,
battery-powered carbon monoxide (CO) detectors are not acceptable.
(Ord. 2015-7. Passed 5-26-15.)
1365.05 PERMITS AND FEES; SUPPLEMENTAL STANDARDS.
   (a)    No smoke detector, carbon monoxide (CO) detector or alternative
system shall be directly connected (permanently wired) to the electrical system
of the structure unless an electrical permit shall have been first obtained and
any applicable fee paid.
   (b)    This chapter is intended to be used with and supplemented by the
applicable provisions of the most current edition of NFPA 72, National Fire
Alarm Code, which are hereby incorporated herein. However, if there shall be
any conflict between this chapter and the supplemental standards, this chapter
and any rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-7. Passed 5-26-15.)
1365.06 ENFORCEMENT, REGULATIONS, AND TAMPERING.
   (a)    Enforcement. The Fire Chief, or his designee, shall have concurrent
jurisdiction to inspect the installation of any smoke detector and/or carbon
monoxide (CO) detector required to be installed by this chapter and any
violations found to exist shall subject the property owners to the penalties
set forth herein. Any owner shall have no less than fourteen (14) days notice
to correct any deficiency before action may be taken.
   (b)    Regulations.
      (1)    No reconnection of electric service shall take place unless smoke
detectors as required herein have been installed in proper locations and have
been demonstrated to be properly operating.
      (2)    Compliance with this section shall be the responsibility of the
owner of the dwelling unit who may designate the name and address of an
authorized agent for this purpose in writing to the Building Inspector.
      (3)    The Fire Chief or his designee shall be charged with the
responsibility of enforcing this section only when otherwise lawfully in the
premises, or when specifically or actually informed of a violation of this
section. Neither the City of Galion nor any of its employees shall be held
responsible for any death, personal injury or property damages suffered by
reason of any failure to comply with this section.
      (4)    This section shall not be construed to relieve any person, firm or
corporation from any obligation otherwise imposed by it or other ordinances,
regulations or statutes including, but not limited to, building and/or fire
codes applicable to any structure.
   (c)    Tampering Prohibited.
      (1)    No person shall, including any landlord or tenant, without
privilege to do so, knowingly move, deface, damage, destroy or otherwise
improperly tamper with a smoke detector or carbon monoxide (CO) detector
required to be installed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter so as to
destroy or diminish its effectiveness or availability for its intended purpose.
      (2)    Any smoke detector, which is missing a battery or has an
inoperable replacement battery shall be replaced by the offending party with a
