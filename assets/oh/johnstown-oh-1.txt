ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 1985-36
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
 
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Johnstown, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW THEREFORE, be it ordained by the Council of the Village of Johnstown,
Licking County, Ohio, that:
SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Johnstown, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and enacted
as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Johnstown, Ohio, 1985.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Johnstown, Ohio.
SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance
except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor.
For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in full force
notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)    The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way.
      (8)    The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)    The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)    Any legislation enacted subsequent to July 1, 1985.
SECTION 3: That all legislation enacted subsequent to July 1, 1985, which
amended, replaced or otherwise affected a material provision of those
ordinances existing prior to July 1, 1985 shall be deemed to amend, replace or
affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified Ordinances as
reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as otherwise
indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
SECTION 4: That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration and daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.
 
SECTION 5: That this Ordinance shall become effective at the earliest date
allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,

provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

CHAPTER 105
Public Records Policy
105.01   Public records.
105.02   Record request.
105.03   Costs for public records.
105.04   Email.
105.05   Failure to respond to a public records request.
105.01 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The Village of Johnstown, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as those items that meet all of the following elements:
      (1)   Any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or
characteristic, including an electronic record; that is created or received or
coming under the jurisdiction of a public office; and
      (2)   Documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations or other activities of the office. This does not include
records kept for our administrative convenience.
   (b)   You may ask for a copy of our records retention schedule, which will
familiarize you with the types of records available. All records of the Village
of Johnstown are public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure
under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)   It is the policy of the Village of Johnstown, that as required by Ohio
Law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying. Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Res. 08-01. Passed 2-19-08.)
105.02 RECORD REQUEST.
   Each request for public records will be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. However, when you make a request, we ask that you
complete a “Public Records Request Form”, which helps us locate the records and
expedite your request. You are not legally required to fill out the form,
identify yourself or give the purpose of your request.
   (c)   Public records are available for inspection during regular business
hours of 8:00 a.m., until 4:00 p.m. weekdays, with the exception of published
holidays. Public records must be made available for inspection promptly. Copies
of public records must be made available within a reasonable period of time.
“Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records requested,
the proximity of the location where the records are stored, and the necessity
for any legal review of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately, if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel roster, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be emailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made available as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged by the Village of Johnstown within three business days following
the office’s receipt of the request. If a request is deemed significantly
beyond routine, such as seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring
extensive research, the acknowledgment must include:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   (1)   Any denial of public records requested must include an
explanation, including legal authority. If portions of a public record are
public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the
rest released. If there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a
supporting explanation, including legal authority.
      (2)   Under Ohio law, some records will be withheld from release because
state or federal law makes the record confidential. Some commonly-requested
records that are confidential include:
         A.   Attorney-client privileged information and trial preparation
records.
         B.   Social Security numbers.
         C.   Records of ongoing investigations.
         D.   Medical records.
         E.   BMV records.
         F.   Records that a judge ordered to be sealed per a statute.
         G.   Peace officer, firefighter, EMT, prosecutor, assistant prosecutor
and familial information (R.C. 149.43(A)(7)).
         H.   Public Employees familial information may not be a public record
under Ohio’s Privacy Act.
         I.   Security of public property.
            (Res. 08-01. Passed 2-19-08.)
105.03 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only for the actual cost of
making copies.
   (a)   For copies of public records on 8.5 x 11 inch one sided paper in black
ink, the copy cost is ten cents per page. We may require you to pay the
estimated copy costs before copies are made. All other copies (photos, disks,
etc.) will be provided at actual cost.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is two
dollars ($2.00) per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents sent electronically.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. If records are
mailed to you, we may charge postage, in advance, and the cost of mailing
materials.
      (Res. 08-01. Passed 2-19-08.)
105.04 EMAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. Email is
to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow
the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Records in private email accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their emails that relate to public business and to archive
them to a secure location.

107.01 CONTRACTS AND PURCHASES; ADVERTISING FOR BIDS.
   When an expenditure within the City, other than the compensation of a person
employed therein, exceeds the competitive bidding threshold amount as set forth
in the Ohio Revised Code Section 9.17(A)(1), (2), such expenditure shall be
authorized and directed by ordinance of Council. When so authorized and
directed, except where the contract is for equipment, services, materials or
supplies available from a qualified nonprofit agency pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4115.31 to 4115.35, the City Manager shall make a written contract with the
lowest and the best bidder after advertising for not less than two nor more
than four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation.
(Ord. 07-2024. Passed 3-5-24.)
107.02 EMERGENCIES; BIDDING NOT REQUIRED.
   In the case of a real and present emergency arising in connection with any
municipally owned utilities or any other department, division, commission,
bureau or board of the Village, Council may, by a two-thirds vote of all the
members elected thereto, authorize the Village Manager to enter into a contract
for work to be done or for the purchase of supplies or materials without formal
bidding and advertising.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.03 POLICIES OF COUNCIL; CIRCUMSTANCES JUSTIFYING WAIVER OF BIDDING.
   In order to implement the requirements of Sections
107.01 and
107.02, Council hereby adopts the following policies:
   (a)    The concept of advertising for and soliciting bids for services and
materials that are necessary to governmental operations is of paramount
importance. Competitive bidding, by its very nature, tends to promote two
occurrences which are essential to effective, efficient service to taxpayers,
namely:
      (1)    The cost of goods and services is held to reasonable limits
because of competition among the various suppliers.
      (2)    Persons who pay taxes and support governmental services are given
an equal opportunity to do business with the government and to share in the
expenditure of tax revenues. In some instances, however, competitive bidding
can work to the detriment of the governmental agency, and, of course, to the
detriment of the taxpayers who support that agency.
   (b)    From the standpoint of assisting the administration for the purpose
of seeking Council action with respect to procuring services and materials, the
following general guidelines shall apply:
      (1)    The department head seeking contracting authority shall present
his or her proposal, together with any documentation and information necessary
for the review of the general nature and cost of the project, to the
appropriate committee or committees of Council.
      (2)    Included within any proposal, the department head shall set forth
a request that the services or materials be purchased either through the
standard bidding procedure or that the bidding procedure be waived. If a
request is made that the bidding procedure be waived, reasons shall be set
forth which shall adequately demonstrate why the waiver is necessary.
      (3)    An emergency may be declared and bidding procedures may be waived
in any of the following circumstances, provided that at least two-thirds of the
members of Council conclude that such circumstances exist.
         A.    If, because time is of a critical consideration, the service or
material must be provided before bidding can be effectively accomplished, then
an emergency is considered to exist and the bidding procedures may be waived.
         B.    If an informal survey conducted by the department head discloses
that it is unlikely that bids will be received as a result of an invitation for
the reason that the service or material is necessary to the operation of the
Village, and the service or material cannot be obtained through bidding
procedures, the bidding procedures may be waived.
         C.    If it is determined that there is a single source for the
services or materials sought, an emergency may be declared for the reasons that
bidding will serve no useful purpose and will waste time and money, and the
bidding procedure may be waived.
         D.    In those circumstances wherein past experience with the peculiar
details of a particular project or item of equipment renders one supplier so
uniquely capable of providing the desired service or material at a
substantially lower price; an emergency may be declared for the reason that
bidding will serve no useful purpose in that no other supplier could provide
the service or material at a lower price, and the bidding procedure may be
waived.
         E.    If, because of the highly technical or peculiar nature of the
service or material to be acquired, the Village does not possess the requisite
experience, training or expertise among its staff members to compile
specifications sufficient to apprise bidders of the desired services or
materials, and if appropriate specifications cannot be obtained elsewhere
without the expenditure of funds for such services, an emergency exists and
bidding may be waived.
         F.    If, because of the highly specialized or technical nature of
personal services to be provided, the experience, training and expertise of
prospective bidders become a critical feature, essential to the success of the
project, and such experience, training and expertise cannot be adequately
measured through the formal structure of the bidding process, an emergency
exists and bidding may be waived.
         G.    By the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, the Village Manager
may participate in State contracts where the Department of Administrative
Services, Office of State Purchasing, has entered into such contracts for the
purchase of supplies, services, equipment or certain materials, where to do so
would be in the best interests of the Village.
         H.    The Village Manager may also participate in Ohio Department of
Transportation contracts where the Department has entered into such contracts
for the purchase of machinery, materials and supplies, and where to do so would
be in the best interest of the Village.
      (4)    In all cases wherein a department head seeks a waiver of bidding,
he or she shall provide sufficient information so that Council may make a
reasonable finding that the singular circumstance of the particular proposed
project constitute an emergency which would permit reasonable minds to conclude
that the circumstances of Section
107.02 exist and that formal advertising and bidding should be waived.
         (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.04 EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR AWARDING OF CONTRACTS.
   (a)   In securing services or materials for projects which are not
anticipated to exceed the competitive bidding threshold as set forth in the
Ohio Revised Code Section 9.17(A)(1), (2), every effort shall be made to secure
the services or materials at the lowest available price.
(Ord. 07-2024. Passed 3-5-24.)
   (b)   With respect to each purchase of services or materials so made,
procedures shall be established so that each supplier of such services or
materials within the local community will be given an opportunity to
participate in the awarding of contracts for such services and materials
whenever possible. In no event shall any supplier of services or materials be
shown a preference or favoritism over other suppliers who are capable of
providing the same or equal services or materials at an equal or lower price.
However, the requirements of this section shall not be construed to require the
award of any contract to a supplier when such an award would be less favorable
to the best interests of the Village than if the contract were awarded to
another supplier. (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.05 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Village Manager is hereby authorized and directed to prepare and
maintain rules and regulations which shall describe procedures and other
requirements designed to carry into effect the intent and purposes specified in
this chapter. Such rules and regulations shall be kept on file in the office of
the Village Manager and shall be available for inspection by the public at all
reasonable times. All prospective bidders or other persons from whom informal
proposals may be solicited shall be advised that such rules and regulations
exist and that they may be examined in the office of the Village Manager.
Copies of such rules and regulations shall be made available, upon request, for
an administrative photocopying fee to be established by the Village Manager.
Such rules and regulations may be amended by the Village Manager from time to
time as he or she may determine to be appropriate in accordance with experience
and practices with respect to the procurement of services and materials.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.06 CONFORMITY WITH STATE LAW.
   Notwithstanding any other requirement set forth in this chapter, formal
bidding procedures may be waived or imposed in any circumstances wherein the
Ohio Revised Code would permit or require the waiver or imposition of
advertising for bids with respect to any project requiring services or
materials.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.07 EXPENDITURES; APPROPRIATION, WARRANT AND CERTIFICATE REQUIRED;
EXCEPTIONS.
   No officer or employee of the Village, or any other person, shall:
   (a)    Make any expenditures of money unless it has been appropriated as
provided in this chapter and in the Ohio Revised Code;
   (b)    Make any expenditure of money except by a proper warrant drawn
against an appropriate fund which shall show upon its face the appropriation
pursuant to which such expenditure is made and the fund against which the
warrant is drawn; or
   (c)    Make any contract or give any order involving an expenditure of money
unless there is attached thereto a certificate of the Village Finance Director
that the amount required to meet the same or, in the case of a continuing
contract to be performed in whole or in part in an ensuing fiscal year, the
amount required to meet the same in the fiscal year in which the contract is
made, has been lawfully appropriated for such purpose and is in the Treasury or
in process of collection to the credit of an appropriate fund free from any
previous encumbrance. Every such contract made without such a certificate shall
be void, and no warrant shall, be issued in payment of any amount due thereon.
If no certificate is furnished as required, then upon receipt by Council of a
certificate of the Village Finance Director stating that there was at the time
of the making of such contract or order, and at the time of the execution of
such certificate, a sufficient sum appropriated for the purpose of such
contract and in the Treasury or in the process of collection to the credit of
an appropriate fund free from any previous encumbrance, Council may authorize
the issuance of a warrant in payment of amounts due upon such contract,
provided that the resolution or ordinance authorizing such warrant is passed
within thirty days from the receipt of such certificate, and provided, further,
that if the amount involved is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
Finance Director may authorize it to be paid without such affirmation of
Council if such expenditure is otherwise valid.
      (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.08 OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENDITURES MADE UNDER CERTIFICATES.
   Upon certification by the Finance Director that a certain sum of money, not
in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000), has been lawfully appropriated,
authorized or directed for a certain purpose and is in the Treasury or in the
process of the collection to the credit of a certain fund free from previous
and then outstanding obligations or certifications, then for such purpose and
from such fund, over a period not exceeding three months and not extending
beyond the end of the fiscal year, expenditures may be made, orders for payment
may be issued, and contracts or obligations calling for or requiring the
payment of money may be made and assumed, provided that the aggregate sum of
money included in and called for by such expenditures, orders, contracts and
obligations shall not exceed the sum so certified. An itemized statement of
obligations incurred and expenditures made under such certificate shall be
rendered to the Finance Director before another such certificate may be issued,
and not more than one such certificate shall be outstanding at a time.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.09 PER UNIT CONTRACTS.
   In any case in which a contract is entered into upon a per unit basis, the
head of the department, board or commission for whose benefit the contract is
made shall make an estimate of the total amount to become due upon such
contract, which estimate shall be certified in writing to the Finance Director.
Such a contract may be entered into if the appropriation covers such estimate,
or so much thereof as may be due during the current year. In such a case, the
certificate of the Finance Director, based upon the estimate, shall be a
sufficient compliance with the law requiring a certificate.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.10 ATTACHMENT OF CERTIFICATES TO ORDERS AND CONTRACTS; EFFECT.
   Any certificate of the Finance Director attached to a contract shall be
binding upon the Village as to the facts set forth therein. Upon request of any
person receiving an order or entering into a contract with the Village, the
certificate of the Finance Director shall be attached to such order or
contract. "Contract, " as used in this section, excludes current payrolls of
regular employees and officers.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.11 MONEYS DEEMED IN TREASURY OR IN PROCESS OF COLLECTION.
   Taxes and other revenue in the process of collection, or the proceeds to be
derived from authorized bonds, notes or certificates of indebtedness sold and
in the process of delivery, shall, for the purpose of this chapter, be deemed
in the Treasury or in the process of collection and in the appropriate fund.
This section does not apply to the investment of sinking funds by the trustees
of such funds, nor to investments made under authority of Ohio R. C. 731.56 to
731.59. (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.12 CONTRACTS AND LEASES EXTENDING BEYOND FISCAL YEAR.
   When contracts or leases run beyond the termination of the fiscal year in
which they are made, the Finance Director shall make a certification for the
amount required to meet the obligation of such contract or lease maturing in
such fiscal year. The amount of the obligation under such contract or lease
remaining unfulfilled at the end of the fiscal year, and which will become
payable during the next fiscal year, shall be included in the annual
appropriation measure for the next year as a fixed charge.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.13 CONTRACTS PAID FROM FUNDS OF DIVISION OF WATER AND SANITARY SEWAGE.
   The certificate required by Section
107.07  and Ohio R. C. 5705.41, as to money in the Treasury, shall not be
required for contracts on which payments are to be made from the earnings of
the publicly owned Division of Water and Sanitary Sewage, but in the case of
any such contract made without such certification, no payment shall be made on
account thereof, and no claim or demand thereon shall be recoverable, except
out of such earnings.
(Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.14 PROCEDURE IN EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   If any officer, or employee of the Village or other person makes any
contract, either verbal or written, or gives any order involving the
expenditure of Municipal moneys without first following the procedure set forth
in Sections
107.07 et seq. , or as may be required by the Ohio Revised Code, either now or
hereafter, the following requirements shall apply:
   (a)    The Finance Director, upon discovering that such contract has been
made or that such an order has been given, shall refuse to issue a warrant for
the payment of any amount due thereon, and such contract or order shall be
deemed to be null and void.
   (b)    The Finance Director shall then notify the officer, employee or other
person who has made such contract or order that no warrant shall be issued for
the payment of any amount due thereon. This notice shall be made in writing,
shall contain a brief statement of the understood facts constituting the basis
of the alleged violation, shall identify by section numbers the provision or
provisions of local and State law which have been violated, and shall direct
such officer, employee or other person to the applicable provisions of Section
107.07 which provide for the action necessary to obtain certification and
authorization for the issuance of a warrant. Copies of such notification shall
be sent to the department head over such officer, employee or other person,
when applicable, and to the Mayor.
   (c)    The officer, employee or other person shall then prepare a standard
application form requesting to appear before the Finance Committee of Council
at its next regular meeting. Such request shall contain the following
information:
      (1)    The identity and address of the person with whom or which the
contract was made or the order placed;

order;
      (3)    The need for the goods or services which are the subject of the
contract or order;
      (4)    A brief statement of the facts or reasons which constitute the
basis for the violation of Sections
107.07 et seq;
      (5)    A brief statement as to whether or not the goods or services may
be returned to the prospective vendor in exchange for a release from any
further responsibility; and
      (6)    Any other matter which the officer, employee or other person
believes to be germane to the circumstances of the contract or order.
   (d)    A copy of the request of the officer, employee or other person to
appear before the Finance Committee, as set forth above, shall be sent to the
Finance Director who shall advise the Committee of the status of any fund out
of which an expenditure for such a contract or order would and could be made,
including the then current appropriated balance in such fund, as well as the
appropriated balance at the time such contract or order was made.
   (e)    The Committee shall then make a recommendation to Council of what
action should be taken with respect to such contract or order. Where
appropriate, such a recommendation shall be in the form of a proposed
resolution.
   (f)    The Finance Director shall prepare a written certification of the
required availability of funds, both as of the time that the contract or order
was made and as of the time of the certification, which shall be forwarded to
Council to be considered in conjunction with the recommendation of the
Committee.
      (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
107.15 LIABILITY TO VILLAGE IN EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Any officer, employee or other person who issues an order contrary to Ohio
R. C. 5705.41 or Sections
107.07  et seq. of this chapter, or who expends or authorizes the expenditure
of any public funds, or who authorizes or executes any contract contrary to
Ohio R. C. 5705.01 through 5705.47, or contrary to Sections

any public funds on any such void contract, obligation or order, unless
subsequently approved as provided in Ohio R. C. 5705.41 or in Sections
107.07  et seq. of this chapter, or issues a certificate under the provisions
thereof which contains any false statement, shall be liable to the Village for
the full amount paid from the funds of the Village on any such order, contract
or obligation. Such officer, employee or other person shall be jointly and
severally liable in person and upon any official bond that he or she has given
to the Village, to the extent of any payment of such void claim. The Village
Director of Law shall enforce this liability by civil action brought in any
court of appropriate jurisdiction in the name of and on behalf of the Village.
If the Law Director fails, upon the written request of any taxpayer to
institute an action for the enforcement of the liability, the taxpayer may
institute suit in his or her own name on behalf of the Village.

109.01 REQUISITIONS FOR PURCHASES.
   (a)   No purchase, construction, alteration or repair shall be made except
upon a requisition by the Village Manager or the officer at the head of the
department for which the same is to be made or done or upon the order of
Council.
 
   (b)   The Village Manager or head of each department shall sign or approve
with his signature all requisitions of his department. In departments where
there are sub-departments or divisions, each requisition shall be signed by the
chief of such sub-department or division and shall be approved by the Village
Manager or officer at the head of such department. There shall be attached to
each requisition a statement setting forth the necessity for the articles
requisitioned. (Ord. 11-13. Passed 10-15-13.)
109.02 SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES.
   (a)    Subject to the system of preferences set forth herein, contracts for
the purchase of all equipment, materials, supplies, and/or services shall be
awarded to the lowest and best bidder. Prior to awarding a contract or making a
purchase of equipment, materials, supplies, and/or services, the Village shall
first conditionally reject any bids or offers that have not been or that will
not be produced in the United States of America only if sufficient competition
can be generated within the United States to ensure that compliance with this
requirement will not result in an excessive price for the product or service or
in acquiring a disproportionately inferior product or service as set forth
below.
 
   (b)    From among the remaining bids, the Village shall select the lowest
and best offer(s) or bid(s) from among those that offer such equipment,
materials, supplies and/or services that have been produced in Ohio only if
sufficient competition can be generated within Ohio to ensure that compliance
with this requirement will not result in an excessive price for the product or
service or in acquiring a disproportionately inferior product or service.
 
   (c)    From the remaining bids, the Village shall select the lowest and best
offer(s) or bid(s) from among those that offer such equipment, materials,
supplies, and/or services that have been produced in Licking County only if
sufficient competition can be generated within Licking County to ensure that
compliance with this requirement will not result in an excessive price for the
product or service or in acquiring a disproportionately inferior product or
service.
 
   (d)    Under circumstances where the preliminary analysis as set forth above
identifies the apparent low offer or bid to be from a Licking County provider,
the Village shall proceed with utilizing standard purchase or contract award
practices and procedures.
 
   (e)    Under circumstances where the preliminary analysis as set forth above
identifies the apparent low offer or bid to be from a provider outside of
Licking County, the Village shall consider the following factors:
      (1)    Whether the equipment, materials, supplies, and/or services can be
procured from within Licking County in sufficient and reasonably available
quantities and of a satisfactory quality;
      (2)    Whether bid(s) or offer(s) have been submitted from within Licking
County;
      (3)    Whether the lowest Licking County bid or offer, if any, offers a
price deemed by the Village to be "excessive." An excessive price shall be a
price that exceeds the lowest non-Licking County bid or offer by more than
three (3) percent;
      (4)   Whether the lowest Licking County bid, if any, offers a
disproportionately inferior product or service.
   (f)    Under circumstances where the Village determines that selection of
the lowest Licking County bid or offer, if any, will not result in an excessive
price or disproportionately inferior product or service, the Village shall
propose a contract award to the party extending the low Licking County bid or
offer at the bid or offer price quoted.
 
   (g)    The Village shall indicate in all its invitations to bid that it will
apply a domestic Licking County and Ohio bid preference as outlined in this
ordinance in the evaluation and award of bids received.
 
   (h)    This section and the system of preferences set forth herein shall not
apply to those purchases wherein the Village is taking advantage of membership
benefits provided through the State of Ohio Cooperative Purchasing Program to
contract for the purchase of equipment, materials, supplies, and/or services
under the benefits of such program.

Surplus Property
110.01   Disposal and sale of surplus property.
   110.01  DISPOSAL AND SALE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY.
   (a)   Surplus property owned by the Village that is determined by the
Finance Director, with the approval of the Village Manager or designee, to no
longer be needed for municipal purposes may be declared surplus and disposed of
by any of the following methods:
      (1)   By sale by sealed bid to the highest bidder, following notice at
least one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village and posted
on the Village website at least ten (10) business days prior to the opening of
the bids.
      (2)   By live public auction.
      (3)   By internet auction. Notice of internet auction will be posted on
the Village website at least ten (10) business days prior to commencement of
bidding.
      (4)   By sale of another government jurisdiction without the requirement
of competitive bidding.
      (5)   By trade-in for credit at the time of purchase of replacement
property, provided that trade-in value is established separately from the
purchase price of the replacement property, and can be verified to represent
fair market value for the traded property.
      (6)   By sale for scrap value, or discarding, if the property can be
shown to have minimal or no residual market value in its current form.
      (7)   By destruction upon the determination by the Village Manager or
designee that the surplus property must be destroyed for public safety reasons.
      (8)   By donation to an appropriate charitable organization with the
approval of the Village Manager or designee.
   (b)   Disposal of all municipally-owned property that has been declared
surplus and to no longer be needed for municipal purposes that has an estimated
value of greater than $5,000.00, or is a motor vehicle, may be disposed of by
any of the above methods with the prior approval of Village Council.
   (c)   The Finance Director will estimate the value of the property deemed by
the user division to be surplus for purposes of determining the method to be
used for the disposal of property. All property determined to be surplus and
disposed of shall be fully documented and recorded for purposes of maintaining
an accurate inventory of Village-owned property.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171.    Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Schedule of charges.
171.02   Rules.
171.03   Mayor’s Court Magistrate.

the United States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the
ORC, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the ORC and the use is not consistent, then the use of the
term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax shall
control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the ORC.
   (B)    The singular shall include the plural, and the masculine shall
include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   
   (C)    As used in this chapter:

taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined
under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
         (b)    Add an amount equal to five percent (5%) of intangible income
deducted under division (C)(1)(a) of this section, but excluding that portion
of intangible income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of property described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (c)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
         (d)   (i)    Except as provided in (C)(1)(d)(ii) of this section,

income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

method as described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax
administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a

   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the Village of Johnstown shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village of
Johnstown. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
191.04 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
191.01 of this chapter, of 1.0%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an

Administrator of the Village of Johnstown the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village of Johnstown in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Johnstown in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Johnstown. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Johnstown as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Johnstown income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village of Johnstown the tax withheld relieves the
employee from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax
withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Village of Johnstown income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Johnstown until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:

employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Village of Johnstown during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Johnstown income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a

wages as provided in Section

            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (A)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Johnstown only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Johnstown than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (A)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village of Johnstown exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Johnstown for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village of
Johnstown.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
of Johnstown under division (A)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the Village of Johnstown for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village
of Johnstown.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village of Johnstown and
the employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
191.03, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village of Johnstown, regardless of the number of days which the employee
worked outside the corporate boundaries of the Village of Johnstown.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (A)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section

municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to

the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

extension of time to file under this division is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that
date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village of Johnstown's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that

received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village of
Johnstown income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the

Village of Johnstown's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village
of Johnstown's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of

      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Johnstown, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required

income tax return under this section, the tax administrator shall not make any

date to file the return, whichever occurs first.
If a tax administrator files section (5), the municipal corporation shall
reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to such
inquiry or notice, up to $150.
This division does not apply to an extension received under section (2) of this
division if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed
to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension under
section (2) of this division or failed to file for an extension under this
division.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this

payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
191.05 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village of Johnstown by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
191.05 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village of Johnstown to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village of Johnstown,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Village of Johnstown or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the Village of Johnstown's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,

Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (B)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (C)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Johnstown's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (B)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Johnstown income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village of Johnstown. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated Village of Johnstown income tax return for a
taxable year shall file a consolidated Village of Johnstown income tax return
for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives
written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a
taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
191.03, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village of Johnstown income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
 191.03 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village of Johnstown income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (A) through (H) of
Section
191.061, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (A) through (H) of
Section
191.061, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (A) through (H) of
Section
191.061, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Johnstown;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Johnstown income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Johnstown income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (A) through (H) of
Section
191.061 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Johnstown income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Johnstown in
accordance with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which
the corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or
more members of such an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Johnstown before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with the Village of Johnstown may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village of Johnstown from qualifying
wages shall be considered as paid to the Village of Johnstown in equal amounts
on each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid
on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Johnstown, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after

year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with ORC 718.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
191.19 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is

payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village of Johnstown under Section
 191.06 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of
Johnstown but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.

191.09  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

191.10  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
 191.19.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax

   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
191.22.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
191.19 (A)(4).

Village of Johnstown as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Johnstown is subject to recovery by the

nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Johnstown
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village of Johnstown's tax rate is less than the tax rate in
the other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
the Village of Johnstown's tax rate. However, if the Village of Johnstown's tax
rate is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in
excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Johnstown,
along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of
nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.

191.12  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Johnstown changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Johnstown. The amended return shall be filed
on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten

facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
191.13 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (E) of
Section
191.13 for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Johnstown. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
191.10.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to

computations, and attachments.

tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Johnstown's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Johnstown return
showing income subject to the Village of Johnstown income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional Village of Johnstown income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.

         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
191.22. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Johnstown does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board

appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided

 191.10, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 191.10.

191.14 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 20-2015.
Passed 11-3-15.)
191.15  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Johnstown
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal
documents, or conducting business at the address; or if, before that time, the
person had conducted business at the address and, when the assessment was
mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate was conducting business at
the address. For the purposes of this section, a person's affiliate is any
other person that, at the time the assessment was mailed, owned or controlled
at least 20 percent, as determined by voting rights, of the addressee's
business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village of
Johnstown official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
191.16 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Johnstown that arises pursuant to the Village of Johnstown's
income tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
191.17 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Johnstown as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Johnstown from
publishing or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose
information with respect to particular taxpayers. (Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-
15.)
191.18 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village of Johnstown ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village of Johnstown or the Tax
Administrator.

to be paid or remitted to the Village of Johnstown on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village of Johnstown to which the return is to be filed or the payment is

191.20 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
191.201  AUTHORITY.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village of Johnstown or for the withholding of
such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply. (Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
191.203  IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION.
   (A)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator

the request was directed pursuant to Section
191.19, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
 191.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

191.20 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
 191.19.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (A)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
191.99 for a violation of Section
 191.18 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)

   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village of
Johnstown, but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or
contractors with the Village of Johnstown at any time during their term or in
the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall
be appointed by the Village Manager of the Village of Johnstown. This member
may be an employee of the Village of Johnstown, but may not be the director of

direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Village of Johnstown Board of Tax
Review shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a

serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the

remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 20-2015. Passed 11-3-15.)
191.23 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
Village of Johnstown, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to
the administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an
income tax imposed by the Village of Johnstown in accordance with this chapter.
Such rules shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of

191.29 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703. of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
 191.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in sections
 191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
 191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
191.30 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
191.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section
191.34 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
191.34 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (C)(48)(b) of section
191.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (C)(24)(d) of section
191.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
191.03(C) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
191.28 to
 191.43 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
 191.38 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.30  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under section
 191.28 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under section
191.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12)(l) and (C)(35)(b)(ii) of section
191.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)

shall provide to the Village a report stating the name and federal
identification number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are
attributable to the Village and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated

information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the Village reserves its right to
pursue any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the
correct tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable

      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to

information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically

   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic

automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.33 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
         (Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.34  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
191.064 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
191.29 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
191.30 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
 191.30 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
191.30 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
191.28 to
 191.43 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
191.30 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.35 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.36 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
 191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.37 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
 191.28 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
191.39 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
 191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code. (Ord. 07- 2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.38 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
191.39 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code.    With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
191.39 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.39 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
 191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)
191.40 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
191.28 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
191.28 to
191.43 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
191.38 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional

taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section

facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return. (Ord. 07-2018. Passed 2-20-18.)

any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a

years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not

(Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    To provide for the purposes of general municipal operations, capital
improvements, maintenance and repair of equipment, streets and other physical
properties, purchase of new equipment, and the payment of principal and
interest on bonds issued by the city, an excise tax of three percent (3%) is
hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or transient
accommodations is or is to be furnished to transient guests, pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 5739.08(A) and furthermore, an additional excise tax of three percent (3%)
is hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel or transient
accommodation is or is to be furnished to transient guests pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 5739.08(B). Purchase of a room or rooms by a transient guest through an
accommodations remarketer is a transaction by which a hotel or transient
accommodation is to be furnished to transient guests and is subject to tax at
the price paid by the transient guest to the accommodations remarketer.
   (b)   Although the above levies are separate and distinct for purposes of
determining distribution, the combined amounts of six percent (6%) are hereby
referred to as the "Hotel/Motel Excise Taxes".
   (c)   The tax applies and is collectible at the time the lodging is
furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid. The tax does not apply
to lodging furnished to exempted entities. Lodging shall be considered to be
furnished to an exempted entity only if the lodging is purchased by an agent of
the exempted entity and directly purchased with the exempted entity's funds.
For purposes of this section, lodging purchased with a credit card on which the
exempted entity is the primary accountholder shall be considered to have been
directly purchased with the exempted entity's funds.
   (d)    For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax it is presumed that all transactions for lodging
furnished by hotels or transient accommodations in the city to transient guests
are subject to tax until the contrary is established by the transient guest.
   (e)    All revenues generated by this excise tax will be distributed as
follows:
      (1)    The entire excise tax collected pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5739.08(A)
shall be deposited into the general fund.
      (2)    The additional excise tax collected pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5739.08
(B) to be distributed as follows: fifty percent (50%) shall be deposited into
the Johnstown Visitors' Bureau Fund, which is hereby created, and which shall
be spent solely to make contributions to convention and visitors' bureaus
operating within Licking County as directed by city council. The remaining
fifty percent (50%) shall be deposited into the general fund.
         (Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   (a)   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest
to the vendor and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full
and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the tax is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must furnish
to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the transient guest, a statement
specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the tax. If no
statement is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applied. (Ord. 50-2021.
Passed 12-14-21.)
194.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The Director of Finance shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid
illegally or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where
the vendor has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such
illegal or erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was
paid by the transient guest directly to the City, the Finance Director shall
refund the appropriate amount to the transient guest. Applications shall be
filed with the Finance Director on the form prescribed by the Finance Director,
within ninety (90) days of the date it is ascertained that the assessment or
payment was illegal or erroneous. However, in any event such application for
refund must be filed with the Finance Director within four (4) years from the
date of the illegal or erroneous payment of the tax. On filing of such
application, the Finance Director shall determine the amount of refund due and
issue the refund to the person claiming such refund.
(Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.05 REQUIRED RECORDS.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter and shall keep all invoices and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guests, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identify, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the Finance Director and shall be
preserved for a period of not less than four (4) years, unless the Finance
Director, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by
order requires that they be kept longer.
(Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   Each vendor shall file a quarterly return on forms prescribed by the Finance
Director showing receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from
the vendor to the city for the period covered by the return, and such other
information as the Finance Director deems necessary for the proper
administration of this chapter. The quarterly return is due on or before the 15
th day of the following month during a calendar year. The Finance Director may
extend the time for making and filing returns. Returns shall be filed by
mailing the same to the Finance Director, together with payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon. The Finance Director shall record the date and
amount of payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a
return under this chapter shall forfeit and pay into the City treasury the sum
of one percent (1%) of the tax due. The Director of Finance, if deemed
necessary in order to ensure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter,
may require returns and payments to be made for other than in quarterly
periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or authorized agent. (Ord.
50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.07 LIABILITY, ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT: PENALTIES.
   (a)    If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, such vendor shall be
personally liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The
Finance Director may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any
information in the Finance Director's possession. If any vendor fails to
collect the tax or any transient guest fails to pay the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject to the tax, such vendor or
transient guest shall be personally liable for the amount of the tax applicable
to the transaction. The Finance Director may make an assessment against either
the vendor or transient guest as the fact may require, based upon any
information in the Finance Director's possession. An assessment against a
vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter has not
been collected or paid, shall not discharge the transient guest's liability to
reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable to such transaction.
   (b)    In each case the Finance Director shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest personally or by registered or
certified mail. An assessment issued against either pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor a bar to
an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if said tax has actually been
paid by another.
   (c)    The Director of Finance may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount for the tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the
possession of the Director of Finance indicates that the amount required to be
collected is, or should be, greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Director of Finance may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business
for a representative period, which are hereby authorized, determined the ratio
which the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's
or transient accommodations' lodging which determination shall be the basis of
an assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment
shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)    Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom said notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty (30) days after service thereof,
either personally or by registered or certified mail a petition, in writing,
verified under oath by said vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent,
having knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of
said assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections,
said assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the Director of
Finance. When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Director of Finance
shall assign a time and place for the hearing of same and shall notify the
petitioner thereof by registered or certified mail, but the Director of Finance
may continue the hearings from time to time if necessary.
   (e)    A penalty of ten percent (10%) shall be added to the amount of every
assessment made under this chapter. The Director of Finance may adopt and
promulgate rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added
to assessments made under this chapter.
   (f)    When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Finance Director,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three (3)
days after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed. (Ord.
50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.08 LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four (4) years
after the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or
more than four (4) years after the return for such period is filed, whichever
is later. This section does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Director of Finance has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging that were not
returned to the city.
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
   (c)   When the Director of Finance and the vendor or guest waives the
limitation in writing.
      (Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.09 TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPTION.
   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating that the
lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax. (Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-
21.)
194.10 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 50-2021. Passed 12-14-21.)
194.11 REPORT FILINGS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement.
   (b)   If any vendor required to file returns under this chapter fails on two
(2) consecutive quarters, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax
thereon, or if any other vendor authorized by the Finance Director to file
returns at less frequent intervals, fails on two (2) or more occasions within a
twenty-four (24) month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax
due thereon, the Finance Director may: require such vendor to furnish security
in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of
one (1) year, as determined by the Finance Director from a review of returns or
other information pertaining to such vendor, which amount shall in no event be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The security may be in the form of
a payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a
corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Finance Director, conditioned upon
payment of the tax due with the returns from the vendor. The security must be
filed within ten (10) days following the vendor's receipt of the notice from
the Finance Director of its requirements.
   (c)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned to

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to

303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,

private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left

ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.

303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §
3301-35-08, a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s
pupils certifying that the school meets state minimum standards for
nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to
the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;

school zone boundaries. The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:

each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the

each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone

established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.

offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

that order.
   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

motor vehicle and shall be punished as provided in subsections (c) to (h) of
this section.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section, whoever

driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C. 4510.02, and, if the vehicle involved

section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license
plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the

in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.
   (e)   All fines collected for violations of subsection (b) hereof shall be
forwarded to the Treasurer of State for deposit as provided in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
   (f)   (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a
person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
 
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “comuter system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, "drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 FILING FEES.
   (a)   Any person, including any firm or organization, desiring to file an
affidavit alleging a violation of one or more sections of any provision of Part
Five - General Offenses Code of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of
Johnstown, shall also deposit with the Clerk of the Mayor’s Court a deposit for
costs attributable to the prosecution of the offenses charged.
   (b)   The amount of security deposit for costs as provided in subsection (a)
hereof, shall be set by Council pursuant to this section.
   (c)   The security deposit for costs as provided herein shall be waived
under any of the following conditions:
      (1)   Upon sworn affidavit, it is shown and demonstrated that the person,
firm or organization desiring to file the affidavit which alleges a violation
of Part Five of the Codified Ordinances, is unable due to financial inability
to pay the costs provided herein; or
      (2)   Upon application to the Mayor, the Mayor determines upon
consideration and order that the filing fee is waived. In considering the
waiving of any of the fees provided herein, the Mayor may, but is not required
to consider the following factors:
         A.   The immediacy of the danger to the general public posed as
alleged by the offenses charged in the purported affidavits;
         B.   As a matter of fundamental fairness, to the affiant, as well as
to the community at large, the imposition of the deposit for security costs
would work an injustice.
            (Ord. 1989-18. Passed 6-6-89.)
501.14 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
 545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
 545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If

attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

717.02 BUYER'S RIGHT TO CANCEL SALE; REQUIREMENTS.

upon the date of postmarking. Telegram delivery is effective when the telegram
is ordered. Manual delivery or other personal delivery is effective when
delivered to the seller or to the seller's address, whichever comes first.
Notice of cancellation need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it

be bound by the home solicitation sale. Notice of buyer's right to cancel must
appear on all notes or other evidence of indebtedness given pursuant to any

cooling-off period for door-to-door sales shall be deemed to comply with the
requirements of subsections (b) (1), (2) and (3) hereof with respect to the

on the envelope, the seller shall record the date of delivery on the notice of
cancellation.

   Where a sale is made pursuant to negotiations that occur at a place other
than the seller's fixed location business establishment where goods or services
are offered or exhibited for sale, but the agreement or offer to purchase is
signed at a seller's fixed location business establishment, a presumption
arises that the sale was a home solicitation sale.

seller fails to return any goods traded in by the buyer, the buyer may elect to

goods in his possession or control for any recovery to which he is entitled.

cancelled or an offer to purchase has been revoked, the buyer upon demand must
make available to the seller any goods delivered by the seller pursuant to the
sale. The goods made available shall not have been diminished in quantity nor

risk.

      (1)    All water and/or sewer bills not paid by the twenty-fifth of each
month shall be sent a notice no later than the second Friday of the month
following the due date of such bill. The notice shall provide in substance that
charges for water and/or sewer have not been received by the Department of
Utilities or its officially designated payment depository and that failure to
pay such bill by due date of delinquent notice will result in service being
disconnected and the payment of a collection charge will be required.

notice shall be placed on a shutoff list for termination of water and/or sewer
service and will require the payment of all delinquent charges and the

      (3)   Shutoffs will be made within ten working days after delinquent
notice is sent for bills for past due services and penalties which have not

      (4)   Any purchaser who contacts the Department of Utilities prior to
shut-off day to request an extension will be granted an extension, but in no
event shall any extension extend past seven days after the date the delinquent
notice as due. Persons requesting an extension can only do so six times in one
calendar year.
      (5)   Any purchaser who contacts the Utility Clerk’s Office prior to the
shut- off day and due to an event of extraordinary circumstances, such as a
large one-time bill due to leaks or additional usage, or a large estimate based
on that circumstance followed by a less than normal billing or a credit when
the meter is actually read, the designated Department of Utilities employee may
permit the purchaser to avoid the termination of water and/or sewer services by
paying one-half of the past-due balance plus penalties and related charges as
set forth in Section
921.10(b)(4), with the other one-half to be paid with the current month’s bill.
      (6)   Undue hardship cases may be decided by the Finance Director or
brought before the Manager for review.

will have such service terminated at the stop cock at the curb, or if not
possible or if multiple units are connected to the same stop cock or curb box,
a notice will be delivered to the purchaser stating that access into the
property for removal of the meter is required. In the case of residential
apartments which are separately metered, the manager or owner of the property
will be notified and will be required to give twenty-four hour notice to the
tenant of any such residential unit to permit employees of the Department of
Utilities into the residential unit to remove the meter.
   (d)   Water service will only be turned on during hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00
p.m., Monday through Friday. Upon approval of the Village Manger, if the
customer requests the water to be turned on after these hours the customer will
be required to pay the Utility Department an additional fee of one hundred
twenty-five dollars ($125.00) before service will be reconnected.
   (e)   If the purchaser has not contacted the Department of Utilities within
forty-eight hours after termination of service, and if such purchaser is other
than the owner of the property, the property owner will be notified that water
service has been terminated and will be notified of the amount of any
outstanding charges.
   (f)   Water service will be terminated thereafter for any accounts which had
previously been extended as set forth above and which remain unpaid. All
policies set forth herein regarding the non-payment of charges and termination
of service will be applied to such account.
(Ord. 1-05. Passed 1-4-05.)
921.11  SERVICE TERMINATION; TURN ON FEE; COLLECTION FEE.
   (a)    Any person may discontinue water service by proper notice to the
Department of Utilities and be relieved of their responsibility when the water
is turned off at the curb box and the account cleared in the records of the
Department of Utilities.

any rule or regulation of this chapter, a collection charge of fifty dollars
($50.00) shall be assessed.
   (c)    In the event that a City employee or employees have been dispatched
to a property to shut off water and/or sewer services due to the water and/or
sewer bill being delinquent or to deliver a shut off notice, a collection
charge as established by the Manager shall nonetheless be assessed on the water
and/or sewer bill. If any purchaser of water and/or sewer services listed on
the shutoff list shows proof of payment being made between the delinquent due
date and the day the shut offs are actually made, the collection charge will be
waived. (Ord. 06-2024. Passed 3-5-24.)
921.12  REPAIRS.
   Whenever a break or leak occurs in a service line between the main and the

if such break or leak occurs from the back of the curb box at any place upon
the premises supplied, the property owner shall have the break or leak repaired
at their expense. Failure to make repairs may result in water being terminated.

permission of the Manager. The performance of any of these acts shall result in
the violator being punished according to law and will result in the water being
terminated. If the Manager finds that a meter seal has been broken or any by-
pass inserted and there is evidence that the meter has been tampered with, the
water shall be shut-off and shall not be turned on again until the consumer or
owner of the premises pay for the estimated quantity of water which has been
used and registered, and in addition thereto a fee for turning the water back
on as set out in Section

   (d)   The Director of Utilities or his duly authorized representative shall
have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a

Municipality for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems
thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served
shall furnish to the Director of Utilities any information which he may request
regarding the piping system or systems of water use on such property. The
refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the
Director of Utilities, be deemed evidence of the presence of improper
connections as provided in this chapter.
   (e)   The Director of Utilities is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection is in violation of the provisions of

of the property shall be required to connect any improvements located on the
property to such sanitary sewer. Any lot, parcel of land, building or premises
abutting a street or alley in which there is a public sanitary sewer or which
can be connected to any such sanitary sewer through the use of easements
contained directly from other private property owners without substantial cost,
shall be deemed to have available access to a sanitary sewer.
   (b)   Where a sanitary sewer is available within 350 feet of any lot, parcel
of land, building or premises, it shall be conclusively presumed that the
sewage from such lot, parcel of land, building or premises is discharged into
such sewer, and the property or premises shall be billed for sewage service
charges as provided by this chapter. If any lot, parcel of land, building or
premises become connected to a sanitary sewer as provided herein, and if such
lot, parcel of land, building or premises are served by a water well, then the
owner of such lot, parcel of land, building or premises shall be required to
install a water meter as provided in Section
921.04, which meter shall be installed at such owner’s expense.

Way within the corporation limits as such Rights of Way are a valuable and
limited resource which must be utilized to promote the public health, safety,

increased the demand and need for access to Rights of Way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
      (3)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the Rights of Way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the Rights of Way, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (4)   The Municipality has authority under the Laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4 and

special duty to any Provider.
   (g)   Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any System in the Municipality shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the Municipality that the
Provider's obligations for its System in the Rights of Way under this section
and any other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another
Applicant and/or Provider; or
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner
that promotes the Municipality's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited Rights of Way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Municipality Engineer; or
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Municipality Engineer must approve said proposal; or
         D.   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
System in a manner acceptable to the Municipality within a reasonable amount of
time if the Municipality believes that there exists a reasonable justification
for such removal; or
         E.   Submit to the Municipality within a reasonable amount of time and
in accordance with O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its Facilities to the Municipality. If a Provider proceeds under
this clause, the Municipality may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the Facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to Section
931.17(b), require the Provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Municipality for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the Facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a Provider who fail to comply with this Section and
which remain Unused Facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Municipality may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         A.   Abating the nuisance;
         B.   Taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the Facilities by the Provider or by the
Provider's surety.
      (3)   If the Municipality requires a Provider to remove Unused Facilities
in any Rights of Way, the Municipality shall use reasonable efforts to direct
that this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the
Rights of Way. If the Municipality abates the nuisance it may take all action
necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not
limited to, those methods set forth in O.R.C. 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A Certificate of Registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the Rights of Way. A Certificate of Registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the
Municipality, for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the
Certificate of Registration and in accordance with Chapter
931 of the Code. The rights to occupy the Right of Way may not be subdivided or
subleased; provided, however, that two or more Providers may collocate
Facilities in the same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider
complies with the provisions of Chapter
931. Collocating Providers may file a joint application for a Construction
Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its
Facilities on Facilities of others, including the Municipality's Facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in
or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not
cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of Chapter
931. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying
with any provisions of the Code or other applicable Law.
   (i)   Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a Certificate
of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such Services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the Municipality's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such
documents to the Municipality. Further, a Certificate of Registration issued
pursuant to Chapter
931 shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with,
the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber,
cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the Municipality.
   (j)   Rules and Regulations. The Municipal Engineer may propose, and Council
may adopt (and from time to time amend) the Rules and Regulations regarding
Chapter
931, Construction standards and occupancy requirements of the Right of Way.
Such Rules and Regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of any
provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in any
way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of Rules and
Regulations increasing Fees; the requiring of the placement of Facilities in
designated portions of the Rights of Way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of Facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the Rules and Regulations, the Municipality shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via United States Regular Mail, to each Provider who holds a then
current Certificate of Registration. Each Provider shall then have thirty (30)
days following the date of the Municipality's mailing to provide written
comment regarding the proposed language to the Municipality. At least forty-
five (45) days, but not more than sixty (60) days following the date of the
Municipality's mailing, the Municipality shall schedule and hold a meeting, to
make available a forum at which all then current Providers may address any
questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new
Rules and Regulations to the Municipality. The Municipality Engineer shall,
following said meeting and the review of the Providers' comments and
suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and Regulations in a manner that best
serves the Municipality, for approval by Municipality Council.

931.04 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each Provider shall, when
requested by the municipality, file a Construction and Major Maintenance Plan
with the Mayor. Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall be provided
for specific geographical areas requested by the municipality, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the Municipality. It shall be
submitted using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the Provider and the
Municipality and shall contain the information determined by the Municipality
to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency
of Construction in the Rights of Way. The Construction and Major Maintenance
Plan shall include, but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or
anticipated Construction projects for the next calendar year, if none are
scheduled or anticipated then the Plan shall so state. The Provider shall use
its Best Efforts in supplying this information and shall update the
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan on file with the Municipality whenever
there is a material change in scheduled and/or anticipated Construction
projects. In an effort to assist Providers with the completion of their annual
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan, the Municipality, as soon as possible,
will send each Provider's System Representative a descriptive narrative (and
any mapping information reasonably available) for all the planned Right of Way
improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the Municipality then currently
intends to undertake during the calendar year.
   (b)   Mapping Data. With the filing of its Application for a Certificate of
Registration, a Provider shall be required to accurately inform the
Municipality of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right
of Way the Provider's System then currently occupies. With the filing of its
Application for a Certificate of Registration, a Provider may voluntarily
provide such mapping data to demonstrate accurately the general location of its
system within the public right of way. The municipality reserves the right to
create its own public way inventory map and may recover the cost of creation
through the Registration process.
   (c)   Exemption from Disclosure. A Provider shall notify the Municipality if
the Provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the Municipality is exempt from the public records disclosure
requirements of O.R.C. 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and
indicate the specific document or portion of a document that the Provider
believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a Provider, the Municipality will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of O.R.C. 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the
Municipality will endeavor to use reasonable Best Efforts to notify the
Provider of the request prior to making the document available for inspection
or copying.

that would normally be required for their Right of Way use in The Municipality,
shall have the mileage of the Right of Way they use and/or occupy included in
the calculations described in Section
931.05, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of Rights of
Way Costs as defined by Chapter
931 with the exception of Permit Costs.
      (8)   The Municipality shall charge an individual Utility for any expense
that can be attributed solely to that Utility. This charge shall be
specifically identified on the Annual Registration Fee Invoice and not used in
the annual Registration Fee calculations.
      (9)   The Municipality may by separate legislation enacted by Municipal
Council on or about April 1st of each year, in accordance with the results of
Section
931.05(a)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual Registration
Maintenance Fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year's Registration Maintenance Fee (per mile). Revised Registration
Maintenance Fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (b)   Timing.  Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the Certificate of
Registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the Certificate of Registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one (1) full year.
   (c)   Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of Municipality property as a result
of a Provider's use or occupation of the Rights of Way, the Provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to Chapter
931 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in Chapter
931. The Registration Maintenance Fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in Chapter
931, or as required by applicable Law.
   (d)   Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any Registration
Maintenance Fee is not paid to the Municipality by January 31, the Provider
shall pay a monthly late charge of one percent (1%) of the unpaid balance for
each month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)   No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the Municipality of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Municipality may have for additional sums payable.

superseded, and Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation
Act, Pub. L. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156 (Feb. 22, 2012) (codified as 47 U.S.C. §
1455(a)), as may be amended or superseded, and all FCC rules and regulations to
interpret and implement applicable federal statutes.
         (Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
931.06.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)    Subject to the Ohio Revised Code and approval of an application under
this section, an operator may collocate a small cell facility and construct,
maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support structures in, along,
across, upon, and under the municipality right-of-way.
      (1)    An operator shall comply with generally applicable standards that
are consistent with this section and any rules, regulations, and design
guidelines adopted by the municipality for the collocation of a small cell
facility and construction, maintenance, modification, operation, or replacement
of wireless support structures in, along, across, upon, and under the
municipality right-of-way, unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law.
      (2)    All wireless support structures and small cell facilities shall be
constructed and maintained so as not to impede or impair public safety or the
legal use of the right-of-way by the municipality, the traveling public, or
other public utilities.
   (b)    The permitting procedures and authorizations set forth herein shall
apply only to small cell facilities and wireless support structures in the
right-of-way, and do not authorize the construction and operation of a wireline
backhaul facility.
 
   (c)    Relationship to other sections. This section shall supersede all
conflicting requirements of other titles and sections of this Code regarding
the locating and permitting of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the right-of-way.
   (d)    Nothing in this section precludes the municipality from applying its
generally applicable health, safety, and welfare regulations when granting
consent for a small cell facility or wireless support structure in the

obtaining, under this section, or Section 1332.24 or 4939.031 of the Ohio
Revised Code, any requisite consent of the municipality. Before placing small
cell facilities or wireless support structures in the right-of-way, an operator
must apply for and receive a general right-of-way certificate of registration
under Section
931.03. If the operator's sole activities in the right-of-way will consist
solely of collocating small cell facilities, constructing, modifying, or
replacing new wireless support structures and associated small cell facilities,
removing such facilities, or eligible facilities requests, then the operator
shall not be required to pay the annual fee for general right-of-way
certificate of registration provided in Section
931.05. This provision shall not be construed to waive application fees or any
other construction or work permit necessary for work in the municipality.
   (b)   Pre-Application Conference.   
      (1)    Purpose. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the
municipality and request a pre-application conference. This meeting will
provide an opportunity for early coordination regarding proposed small cell
facilities and wireless support structure locations and design, and the
application submittal and review process, in order to avoid any potential
delays in the processing of an application and deployment of small cell
facilities and wireless support structures in the municipality.
      (2)    Appointment Required. An appointment is required for all pre-
application conferences. Applicants must contact the designated municipality
staff member as noted on the application form, who will provide applicants an
appointment with all applicable municipality representatives in a timely
manner.
   (c)    Application Required. In accordance with federal and state law and
the municipality code, an operator may apply to the municipality to collocate a
small cell facility on an existing wireless support structure and to construct,
maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support structures in, along,
across, upon, and under the municipality rights-of-way. Anyone seeking to
collocate a small cell facility on an existing wireless support structure and/
or to construct, maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support
structures in, along, across, upon, and under the municipality rights-of-way
shall first duly file a written application with the municipality, in
accordance with the requirements in this section and additional requirements
set forth in the Design Guidelines as modified from time to time by the Mayor.
   (d)    Required Application Materials. Unless otherwise required by state or
federal law, all applicants shall submit to the municipality materials and
information associated with each application as outlined in the Design
Guidelines in order for the application to be considered complete.
(Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
931.06.04 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS.
   (a)    Permit Application Review Timeframes.  
      (1)    Collocation of Small Cell Facilities on Existing Wireless Support
Structures. The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
collocate, or to replace or modify a small cell facility on, or associated
with, an existing wireless support structure not later than ninety days after
the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)    New Wireless Support Structures and Associated Small Cell
Facilities.  The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
construct, modify, or replace a wireless support structure associated with a
small cell facility within the right-of-way not later than one hundred twenty

      (3)    Wireless Support Structure and/or Small Cell Facilities Removal.
The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to remove
wireless support structures associated with small cell facilities from the
right-of-way typical to the review timeframes for the General Right-of-Way
Permit required for this activity.
      (4)    Eligible Facilities Request. The municipality shall approve
Eligible Facilities Requests in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 4939,
47 C.F.R. §1.40001, and not later than sixty days after the date of filing by
an entity of a submitted application.
   (b)   Failure to Grant or Deny Within Prescribed Timeframes. If the
municipality fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section
or a request for a relevant work permit within the timeframes required,
provided the time period is not tolled or extended with the written consent of
the applicant and the Mayor, the request shall be deemed granted upon the
requesting entity providing notice to the municipality that the time period for
acting on the request has lapsed.
   (c)   Application Denials.  
      (1)    The municipality shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent
for small cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-
way.
      (2)    If a request for consent is denied, the municipality shall provide
in writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)    Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the
municipality, for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to
any person based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical,
and managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (d)    Tolling of Required Timeframes.   
      (1)    The time periods required in this section may be tolled only:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and the
municipality;
         B.   In cases where the municipality determines that the application
is incomplete; or
         C.   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth this section due to
the lack of resources of the municipality, then the municipality may toll the
time limits as follows:
            1.    The time period may be tolled for up to twenty-one days for
each group of fifteen small cell facility or wireless support structure
requests received by the municipality based on date of receipt by the
municipality.
            2.    In no instance shall the municipality toll the time period
for any small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than
ninety consecutive days. Upon request, the municipality shall provide an
operator written notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless
support structure request.
      (2)    To toll the time period for incompleteness, the municipality shall
provide written notice to the person requesting consent not later than thirty
days after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all
missing documents or information. The missing documents or information shall be
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described in
Section 4939.0313 of the Ohio Revised Code or documentation intended to
illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for the
request, in accordance with state and federal law, does not toll the time
period for incompleteness.
      (3)    The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the municipality's notice
of incompleteness.
      (4)    If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the municipality shall
notify the entity not later than ten days after receiving the supplemental
submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information
identified in the original notice that delineated missing documents or
information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices under the procedures identified in divisions (d)(1) to (3) of this
section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing
documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.
   (e)   Consolidated application for multiple small cell facilities and/or
wireless support structures.
      (1)    Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace
more than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure
may file, at the applicant's discretion, a consolidated application for up to
thirty (30) small cell facility requests or up to thirty (30) wireless support
structure requests in a single application and receive a single permit for the
construction, modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell
facilities or wireless support structures subject to the following:
         A.   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         B.   The municipality may separately address small cell facility
collocations or wireless support structures for which incomplete information
has been received or which are denied.
      (2)    In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for
in Section 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code and in separate fee ordinances
may be cumulative. However, the municipality, at its discretion may opt to
reduce such fees in order to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)    In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell
facility or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified,
collocated on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for
purposes of tolling the response deadline as authorized under Section 4939.036
of the Ohio Revised Code and this ordinance. A request by a single operator for
a new or replacement wireless support structure and associated small cell
facility constitutes one request.
   (f)    Timeframe for Completion of Permit.   
      (1)    Collocations of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures and the construction of new wireless support structures and/or
associated small cell facilities for which permits have been granted shall be
completed by the operator or its agent within one hundred eighty (180) days
after issuance of the permit, unless:
         A.   The municipality and the operator agree to extend this period; or
         B.   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipality-owned
wireless support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial
power or backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            1.    The operator has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            2.    The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)    If divisions (f)(1)A. and B. of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the municipality grants an extension in writing to
the operator.
   (g)    Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support Structure activities not
requiring consent.
      (1)    Municipality consent shall not be required for either of the
following activities conducted in the right-of- way:
         A.   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
         B.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the municipality's current design requirements and
guidelines and that are either:
            1.    Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
            2.    The same size or smaller than the existing wireless
facilities.
      (2)    The municipality may require a Right-of-Way Construction Permit
for any activity described in division (g)(1) of this section and for any
activity for which consent is authorized herein and in accordance with state
and federal law if such work involves blocking any access to the right of way
or roadways, including the use of traffic control measures required by the
municipality or other relevant laws.

materials or requirements in addition to, and separate from, Design Guidelines
so long as the information, materials, or requirements do not conflict with
state or federal law.
   (d)    The Mayor shall have authority to update or supplement the Design
Guidelines to address relevant changes in law, technology, or administrative
processes.
   (e)    Where the municipality has designated an underground corridor,
placement of any support structure shall be in harmony and of the same general

calculate all the actual and incurred Construction Permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
Rights of Way that will result from Construction that takes place therein.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
Section means the accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way caused by
Construction in or disturbance of the Rights of Way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such Rights of Way earlier than would be required if the
Construction did not occur.
      (3)   The Municipality, shall total all the Construction Permit Fee
receipts received in accordance with the scheduled fees required by the prior
year's Construction Permit Fees for the previous calendar year.
      (4)   The Municipality shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
Section
931.13(d)(2) by the total Construction Permit Fees received as referenced in
Section
931.13(d)(3) to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous years
cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The Municipality shall multiply the then currently codified
Construction Permit Fees by the numerical factor as referenced in Section
931.13(d)(4) to calculate revised Permit Fees for the new calendar year.
      (6)   The Municipality shall act, in accordance with the results of
Section
931.13(d)(5), to codify new annual Permit Fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous years Permit
Fees. Revised Permit Fees shall be effective upon passage. Any Permit requests
pending on the date of any annual Permit Fee modification shall be subject to
all new Permit Fees as modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in subsection Section
931.13(d)(8), no Construction Permit shall be issued without payment of
Construction Permit Fees except to the Municipality which shall be exempt.
Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the Municipality has
revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of Section
931.10 or Section
931.16(e) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Mayor may permit a Provider to make quarterly or annual
payments of Construction Permit Fees based upon the Provider's financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly or annual payments shall be
due and payable within thirty (30) days of invoicing by the municipality. The
Mayor may revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late
payment, or other just cause.
   (e)   Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
Applications for Construction Permits to work in the Rights of Way at the same
place and time. Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
Construction Permit Fees.

931.14 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (a)   Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights of Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Municipality) or another Permittee, a Permittee
shall conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Municipality Engineer. Where such
Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
Permittee located within the Rights of Way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the Municipality to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Municipality Engineer, a Permittee shall also record
and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way
along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way.
         D.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
931.14(a)(1)D., Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Municipality Engineer, a Permittee
shall not excavate more than a twelve (12) inch hole in the Rights of Way to
complete this task for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be
immediately repaired by the Permittee. A minimum of two (2) Working Days'
notice shall be provided to the Municipality prior to performing these
investigations.
         E.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)   The Engineer may modify the scope of the utility engineering study
as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)   Copy to Municipality. Upon completion of the tasks described in
Section
931.14(a), the Construction Permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled in
accordance with the requirements of Section
931.06(b), the proposed System route maps and Construction Plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the Provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Municipality. The mapping data is only required for the Municipality to
reasonably determine the location of the Provider's facilities in the Rights of
Way. The Provider shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Municipality
Engineer determines that the format currently being used by the Provider is not
capable of being read by the Municipality.
   (c)   Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Municipality Engineer the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (d)   Cost of Study. The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
931.14(a) to (c).
   (e)   Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in Chapter
931 or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Municipality Engineer waives
any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances,
a Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction schedule to the
Municipality not less than five (5) Working Days before commencing any work in
or about the Rights of Way, and shall further notify the Municipality not less
than two (2) Working Days in advance of any excavation in the Rights of Way.
This Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances
under Section
931.16(d)(1) (Emergency Situations) and Section
931.15 (Minor Maintenance).
   (f)   Location of Facilities
      (1)   The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws and the Municipality's Rules and Regulations. Detailed plans
and applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Municipality for review
and approval prior to construction of any Facilities except those that are
categorized as "Minor Maintenance" issues as per Section
931.15 herein.
      (2)   The Municipality shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right
of Way is Full. In making such decisions, the Municipality shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights
of Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health,
safety and welfare, the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year with
respect to essential Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the
Rights of Way, future Municipality and County plans for public improvements,
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest
and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)   Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface Rights of Way pursuant to Chapter
931 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable,
wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to Chapter
931 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)   Special Exceptions. The Municipality may grant a special exception to
the requirements of Section
931.14(f) and Section
931.14(g) if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
        (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the Municipality.
      (3)   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the Municipality herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Municipality.
   (i)   Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way
whenever the Municipality finds it necessary to request such removal and
relocation. In instances where the Municipality requests removal and/or
relocation, the Municipality shall waive all applicable Construction Permit
Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall restore the Rights of
Way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal or
relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then
the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In
accordance with Law, the Municipality may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Municipality.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right of Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Rights of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Municipality, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Municipality, a Provider
fails to commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated by
the Municipality, within thirty (30) days after the Municipality's removal
order, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including
all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the Municipality, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the Municipality shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the Municipality with all rights of ownership, including, but not
limited to, the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer
of all right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for
operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the Municipality at Provider's cost and
expense, by another Person; however, the Municipality shall have no liability
for any damage caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the
Municipality for all reasonable costs incurred by the Municipality in such
action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the
Municipality designated by the Municipality for removal and not timely removed
by the Provider shall belong to and become the property of the Municipality
without payment to the Provider, and the Provider shall execute and deliver
such documents, as the Municipality shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the Municipality, to evidence such ownership by the Municipality.
   (j)   Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any Rights of Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its Facilities.
      (2)   All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)   Rights of Way Restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of Rights of Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
Engineer, and complete the restoration of the Rights of Way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Municipality.
      (2)   In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the
Municipality may choose either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way
or alternatively to restore the Rights of Way itself if the Permittee has in
the past not abided by requirements of Chapter
931.
      (3)   If the Municipality allows a Permittee to restore the Rights of
Way, the Permittee may at the time of Application for a Construction Permit be
required to post a Construction Bond in an amount submitted by the Permittee
with a detailed cost breakdown to the Municipality Engineer for approval that
is sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to its
approximate pre-excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion
of the Restoration of the Rights of Way, the Municipality determines that the
Rights of Way have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond
shall be released.
      (4)   The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the Municipality. The Municipality shall have
the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and may do
so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
Municipality in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following
standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the
excavations, disruptions or damage to the Rights of Way; the traffic volume
carried by the Rights of Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the
Rights of Way; the pre-excavation condition of the Rights of Way; the remaining
life-expectancy of the Rights of Way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights of Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights of Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the Rights of Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Rights of Way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Mayor, correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary using the method
required by the Municipality Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Mayor, unless otherwise extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Municipality, or fails to satisfactorily
and timely complete all repairs required by the Municipality, the Municipality,
at its option, may do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the
Municipality, within thirty (30) days of billing, the Restoration cost of
restoring the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the Municipality.
Upon failure to pay, the Municipality may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Municipality and/ or
another Permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the Restoration
responsibility among the Municipality, Providers and/or other Persons.
   (l)   Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the
Municipality performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary, as may
be allowed by Law, to maintain, support, or move a Provider's Facilities to
protect those Facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that
Provider and shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing.
Upon failure to pay, the Municipality may pursue all legal and equitable
remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or the Municipality may call upon
any bond or letter of credit posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all
legal or equitable remedies. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the Facilities of another Provider caused during the
Municipality's response to an Emergency occasioned by that Provider's
Facilities.
      (2)   Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Municipality-owned Facilities in the Rights of Way which the Provider or its
Facilities damage.
   
   (m)   Rights of Way Vacation.
      (1)   If the Municipality sells or otherwise transfers a Rights of Way
which contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer shall be
subject to any existing easements of record and any easements required pursuant
to O.R.C. 723.041.
   (n)   Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Municipality Engineer.
   (o)   Inspection. When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Municipality.
      (1)   The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or Chapter
931.
      (3)   The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
which does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as
provided in Section
931.19(b). An order may be appealed to the Municipality Administrator. The
decision of the Municipality Administrator may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Municipality
Administrator that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Mayor may revoke the Permit pursuant to
Section
931.16(e).
   (p)   Other Obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other Laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all Laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
Laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the Rights of Way
pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No Rights of Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
931.16(d)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a Rights of Way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Municipality Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (q)   Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by Chapter
931, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the Municipality, always use Best Efforts to
place Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right of Way
shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
 931.15 MINOR MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Requirement. Minor Maintenance
means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of Facilities with like Facilities
not involving Construction and not requiring traffic control (ii) or the
routine repair or replacement of Facilities with like Facilities not involving
Construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours

process for a Provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
Minor Maintenance.
      (1)   Minor Maintenance is allowed without a construction permit.
   (b)   Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit Fees. The Municipality shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit but
may revoke the Right of Way Minor Maintenance Permit as any other Permit may be
revoked under this Chapter.
(Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
931.16 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (a)   Mandatory Denial of Permit.  Except in the case of an Emergency, no
Permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any Person who has not yet made an Application; or
      (2)   To any Person who has outstanding debt owed to the Municipality
unless payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the
Municipality Fiscal Officer and the Municipality Solicitor;
          
         or
      (3)   To any Person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a Permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Municipality Administrator, the
issuance of a Permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict
or interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Municipality Administrator, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by
the safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the Rights of
Way, and by considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (b)   Permissive Denial of Permit. The Municipality Administrator may deny a
Permit in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the Rights
of Way, or when necessary to protect the Rights of Way and its users.
      (1)   The Municipality Administrator, in his/her discretion, may consider
one or more of the following factors:
         A.   The extent to which Rights of Way space where the Permit is
sought is available; and/or
         B.   The competing demands for the particular space in the Rights of
Way; and/or
         C.   The availability of other locations in the Rights of Way or in
other Rights of Way for the proposed Facilities; and/or
         D.   The applicability of Chapter
931 or other regulations of the Rights of Way that affect location of
Facilities in the Rights of Way; and/or
         E.   The degree of compliance of the Provider with the terms and
conditions of its Certificate of Registration, Chapter
931, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         F.   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the Rights of Way;
and/or
         G.   The condition and age of the Rights of Way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Rights of Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Rights of Way; and/or
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of Chapter
931 or, if applicable, any other Law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twenty four (24) months after construction completion
or a newly reconstructed street within twelve (24) months of reconstruction
completion, except where:
         A.   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         B.   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         C.   The Municipality Engineer determines it is in the best interests
of the Municipality that such an open cut take place.
   (c)   Discretionary Issuance of Permit.  
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
931.16(a)(1) and Section
931.16(a)(2), the Municipality Administrator may issue a Permit in any case
where the Permit is necessary;
         A.   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
Permit Applicant, if established by Credible evidence satisfactory to the
Municipality; or

         C.   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
Permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a Permit under this Section, the Permit Applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
Service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (d)   Work Done Without a Permit in Emergency Situations.
      (1)   Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Municipality Administrator of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Municipality Engineer, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and
fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance
with Chapter
931 for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency. In the event
that the Municipality becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Provider's
Facilities, the Municipality shall use Best Efforts to contact the Provider or
the System Representative of each Provider affected, or potentially affected,
by the Emergency. In any event, the Municipality may take whatever action it
deems necessary in order to respond to the Emergency, the cost of which shall
be borne by the Provider whose Facilities caused the Emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an Emergency, any Provider who Constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a Rights of Way without a valid
Permit must subsequently obtain a Permit, pay double the normal fee for said
Permit, pay double all the other fees required by the Code, deposit with the
Municipality the fees necessary to correct any damage to the Rights of Way and
comply with all of the requirements of Chapter
931.
   (e)   Revocation of Permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Municipality reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any Law, or any provision or condition of
the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Municipality or its citizens; or
         C.   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the Application for a
Permit; or
         D.   The failure to maintain the required Construction or Removal
Bonds and/or insurance; or
         E.   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
Certificate of Registration; or
         F.   The failure to complete the Construction in a timely manner; or
         G.   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant to
Section
931.14(o)(3).
      (2)   If the Municipality Administrator determines that the Permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
condition of the Permit, the Municipality Administrator shall serve a written
demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Municipality Administrator may place
additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Municipality
Administrator with a plan, acceptable to the Municipality Administrator, for
its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Municipality
Administrator, or the Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
Permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the Permit.
      (4)   If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year,
except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the
Municipality for the Municipality's reasonable costs, including Restoration
costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection with such revocation.
         (Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
931.17 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (a)   Construction Bond. Prior to the commencement of any Construction, a
Construction Permittee, excluding the Municipality and the County, shall
deposit with the Municipality an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit
and/or surety bond in an amount determined by the Municipality Solicitor to be
appropriate based upon fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a Construction
default, problem or deficiency involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of
the general public, the Municipality shall serve written notice to the
Construction Permittee detailing the Construction default, problem or
deficiency. If the Municipality determines that correction or repair of the
Construction default, problem or deficiency has not occurred or has not been
substantially initiated within ten (10) calendar days after the date following
service and notification and detailing the Construction default, problem or
deficiency, then the Municipality may attach the letter of credit or surety
bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the Construction
Permittee by the Municipality.
   (b)   Removal Bond. Upon issuance of a Certificate of Registration and
continuously thereafter, and until one hundred twenty (120) days after a
Provider's Facilities have been removed from the Rights of Way, (unless the
Municipality notifies the Provider that a reasonably longer period shall
apply), a Provider shall deposit with the Municipality and maintain an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal
to or greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$100,000.00), the
Municipality shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Provider a period of
five (5) calendar days after serving notification in writing to correct or
repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to the Municipality attachment
of the letter of credit or surety bond regarding the removal of Facilities.
Upon attachment, written notice shall be provided to the Provider by the
Municipality.
   (c)   Blanket Bond.
      (1)   In lieu of the Construction Bond required by Section
931.17(a) and the Removal Bond required by Section
931.17(b), Provider may deposit with the Municipality an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of Five Million
Dollars (US$5,000,000.00). Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency
involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the
Municipality shall make all reasonable effort to allow Permittee a period of
five (5) calendar days after sending notification in writing to correct or
repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Municipality's attachment of
the letter of credit or surety bond.
   (d)   Self Bonding.  Any provider regulated by the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio shall be considered self-bonded and the municipality may use
enforcement through the PUCO or courts of competent jurisdiction to enforce the
bonding purposes of this ordinance.
   (e)   Purposes.
      (1)   The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to the
extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
         A.   The faithful performance by the Permittee or Provider of all
terms, conditions and obligations of Chapter
931; and
         B.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Municipality
occasioned by the Permittee or Provider's violation of Chapter
931 or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders, Permits and
other directives of the Municipality issued pursuant to Chapter
931; and
         C.   The payment of all compensation due to the Municipality,
including Permit Fees; and
         D.   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance

surety; and
         G.   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the
Municipality pursuant to Chapter
931 or the Law.
   (f)   Form. The bond documents required by this Section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until ninety (90) days after completion of Construction of the Facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least ninety (90) days' written notice to Municipality of
surety's intention to cancel or not renew this bond. (Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-
21.)
931.18 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   Municipality Does Not Accept Liability.
      (1)   By reason of the acceptance of an Application, the grant of a
Permit or the issuance of a Certificate of Registration, the Municipality does
not assume any liability:
         A.   For injuries to Persons, damage to property, or loss of Service
claims; or
B.   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the installation,
presence, maintenance or operation of Facilities.
   (b)   Indemnification.
      (1)   By applying for and being issued a Certificate of Registration with

is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Municipality's agents,
elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors from all
costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising out of
the Construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or operation of
its Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a Rights of Way,
whether any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited
by a Permit. Such requirement to defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall not
extend to the negligence of the Municipality or its agents, elected officials,
officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors, to the extent that the
existence of such negligence shall be proven to exist. A Provider or Permittee
shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action, suit or other proceeding
claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against the Municipality's
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and subcontractors
for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence, installation,
maintenance or operation of its Facilities, or any activity undertaken in or
near a Rights of Way, whether the act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed or prohibited by a Permit. This Section is not, as to third parties, a
waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the Provider,
Permittee or to the Municipality; and the Provider or Permittee, in defending
any action on behalf of the Municipality, shall be entitled to assert in any
action every defense or immunity that the Municipality could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:
         A.   To the fullest extent permitted by Law, all Providers and
Permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Municipality, its elected officials, agents, officers,
employees, volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits,
claims (including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the
Municipality or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments
for injury or damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable
legal fees, costs and expenses assumed by the Municipality in connection
therewith); and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of Provider or Permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the
Rights of Way, to which Provider's or Permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the Municipality's negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage; and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the Municipality's actions; and
            3.   Arising out of Provider or Permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of Law applicable to Provider or Permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the Municipality:
         A.   Giving Provider or Permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought; and
         B.   Affording the Provider or Permittee the opportunity to jointly
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         C.   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and making available to
the Provider or Permittee all pertinent information under the Municipality's
control.
      (3)   The Municipality shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and
defense thereof, and the Provider or Permittee shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such separate counsel if employed.
         (Ord. 17-2021. Passed 5-4-21.)
931.19 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Reservation of Regulatory and Police Powers. The Municipality, by the
granting of a Permit or by issuing a Certificate of Registration pursuant to
Chapter
931, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the
lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the
Municipality under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of
Ohio or the Municipality to regulate the use of the Rights of Way. The
Permittee by its acceptance of a Permit, or Provider by applying for and being
issued a Certificate of Registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful
powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as now are
or the same as may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the
Municipality, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise
thereof by the Municipality at any time. A Permittee or Provider is deemed to
acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of
the Municipality to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the
safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all
applicable general Laws and ordinances enacted by the Municipality pursuant to
such powers.
   (b)   Rules and Regulations. The Municipality may propose, and the
legislative authority may adopt (and from time to time amend) the Rules and
Regulations regarding Chapter
931, Construction standards and occupancy requirements of the Right of Way.
Such Rules and Regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of any
provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in any
way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of Rules and
Regulations increasing Fees; the requiring of the placement of Facilities in
designated portions of the Rights of Way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of Facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the Rules and Regulations, the Municipality shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via electronic mail, to each Provider who holds a current
Certificate of Registration. Each Provider shall then have thirty (30) days
following the date of the Municipality's mailing to provide written comment
regarding the proposed language to the Municipality. At least forty-five (45)
days, but not more than sixty (60) days following the date of the
Municipality's notification, the Municipality shall schedule and hold a
meeting, to make available a forum at which all then current Providers may
address any questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the
proposed new Rules and Regulations to the Municipality. The Municipality
Engineer shall, following said meeting and the review of the Providers'
comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and Regulations in a manner
that best serves the Municipality, for approval by the legislative authority.
   (c)   Method of Service. Any notice or order of the Mayor, Municipality
Administrator, Municipality Fiscal Officer, Municipality Council, or
Municipality Engineer shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof
is:
      (1)   Delivered personally; or
        (2)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served or via electronic mail; or
        (3)   Left at the usual place of business of the person to whom it is

Engineer and the Manager in order that the health and welfare of the people
will be protected.
   (b)    No natural drainage course shall be altered and no fill, buildings or
structures shall be placed in it unless provisions are made for the flow of
water in a manner satisfactory to the Village Engineer. An easement shall be
provided on both sides of any existing important surface drainage course
adequate for the purpose of protecting, widening, deepening, enclosing or
otherwise improving such stream for drainage purposes.
   (c)    A master grade plan shall be prepared for all subdivisions and shall
be presented to the Manager for review and approval by the Village Engineer.
The grading plan shall show the existing topography, the proposed street grades
and the proposed storm sewers with pipe sizes and grades. It shall also show
the proposed and shall delineate the method of rear yard drainage by showing
proposed scales and direction of surface slope by arrows. The grading plan
shall follow the standards as established for such grading by the Federal
Housing Administration.
   (d)    Wherever possible, with exceptions being made where the topography of
an area does not permit such grading practice, lots shall be graded from the
rear lot line to the street. Where a lot abuts directly on two streets, the
grade shall be from the corner of the lot which is diagonally opposite to the
corner of the two streets on which the lot abuts. This section is included in
order to reduce the amount of water standing in yards to a minimum. Therefore,
where it is not possible to grade a lot in the prescribed manner, the owner or
developer shall provide for the adequate drainage of any and all low areas and
tie such drainage into and make it a part of the storm sewer system, the

1131.01 PURPOSE.
   Under some unusual circumstances, a proposed use which more intensely
affects an area than those uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is
located, may nonetheless be desirable and compatible with permitted uses, if
that use is properly controlled and regulated. Such uses shall be listed as
conditional uses within the description of the respective zoning districts. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may allow such a use to be established as a
conditional use where these unusual circumstances exist and where the proposed
use will be consistent with the general purpose and intent of this Planning and
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 15-2019. Passed 4-16-19.)
1131.02 APPLICATION FOR CONDITIONAL USE.
   Any person owning or having an interest in property may file an application
to use such property for a conditional use provided for by this Ordinance in
the zoning district in which the property is situated. An application for a
conditional use shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector, who shall forward a
copy to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The application shall contain the
following information:.
   (a)   All of the information required for a zoning certificate, pursuant to
Section 41131.03.
   (b)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic circulation, open
spaces, landscaping, refuse, and service areas, utilities, signs, yards, and
such other information as the Commission may require to determine if the
proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this Ordinance.
   (c)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property,
and a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and other
properties in the district.
   (d)   The names and addresses of all property owners contiguous to, and
directly across the street from the property, as appearing on the Licking
County Auditor's current tax list.
   (e)   Such other information regarding the property, proposed use, or
surrounding area as may be pertinent to the deliberations of the Planning and
Zoning Commission as determined by the Village Planner.
      (Ord. 15-2019. Passed 4-16-19.)
1131.03 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   The Commission shall not approve a conditional use unless it shall, in each
specific case, make specific findings of fact directly based on the particular
evidence presented to it, that support conclusions that such use at the
proposed location shall meet all of the following requirements:
   (a)   Will be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the
general vicinity and that such use will not change the general character of
such area.
   (b)   Seeks to maintain, and will not be hazardous to, the health, safety
and welfare of the existing neighborhood, and the total community.
   (c)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewers, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services.
   (d)   Will not create excessive additional requirements for public
facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic welfare of
the community.
   (e)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare or odors.
   (f)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designated as not to interfere with traffic on surrounding public streets or
roads.
   (g)   Complies with any other requirements or standards that are cited under
the specific zoning district regulations of this Ordinance.
   (h)   Will be in accord with the general objectives, or with any specific
objective, of the strategic plan and the Zoning Ordinance
   (i)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
   (j)   Is a conditional use identified for the applicable zoning district.
   It shall be the duty of the applicant to present by the preponderance of
evidence, sufficient proof in the application to demonstrate that the
requirements cited above are met.
(Ord. 15-2019. Passed 4-16-19.)
1131.04 ACTION BY THE PLANNING AND ZONING COMMISSION.
   Within sixty (60) days from the date of the application, the Commission
shall approve, approve with supplementary conditions as authorized in Section
1131.05, or disapprove the application as presented. In rendering its decision,
the Commission may contact and seek input from adjacent property owners and/or
other interested parties. If the application is approved with supplementary
conditions, the Commission shall direct the Zoning Inspector to issue a zoning
certificate listing the specific conditions listed by the Commission for
approval. If the application is disapproved, the applicant may seek relief
pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, the Johnstown Village Charter or other
ordinances of the Village. If no action is taken by the Commission within the
specified time frame, the application shall be considered as approved.
(Ord. 15-2019. Passed 4-16-19.)
1131.05 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS
   In granting any conditional use, the Commission may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with this chapter.
(Ord. 15-2019. Passed 4-16-19.)
1131.06 EXPIRATION AND REVOCATION OF ZONING CERTIFICATE ISSUED UNDER
CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS.
   The approval of the zoning certificate issued in accordance with Section
1131.04 above, shall become null and void if such use is not fully implemented,
as evidenced by issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance, within eighteen
(18) months after date of approval; however, the Planning and Zoning Commission
may grant an extension of a zoning certificate for a conditional use for an
additional period of six (6) months upon good cause shown by the applicant.
Good cause may include such factors as adverse weather or site conditions,
difficulty in procurement of materials, or delay due to complexity of the
project despite the applicant's diligent and good-faith efforts to comply with
the eighteen-month timeframe. The Planning and Zoning Commission may revoke the
zoning certificate, if it finds, based upon written evidence by any citizen or
official of the Village, of violation of this Ordinance and/or written terms
and conditions upon which approval was based. The Conditional Use Permit shall
authorize at most only the conditional use applied for and such Conditional Use
Permit shall automatically expire, if for any reason the conditional use shall
cease for more than one (1) year, unless the property owner or occupant shows
that such cessation is due to force majeure or other calamity or casualty
outside the control of the property owner or occupant, which the property owner
or occupant is working diligently and in good-faith to remedy.

   It shall be the affirmative duty of the applicant to present by the
preponderance of evidence, sufficient basis to demonstrate the propriety of a
conditional permit. Mere application for the permit is not sufficient. (Ord.

necessary conditions are applied to maintain a harmonious environment within
the City of Johnstown.
      (2)   Maintain life, health, safety and welfare of surrounding properties
and persons interacting with the temporary use.
      (3)   Review mitigation measures to minimize impacts to mobility
(vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians) and surrounding properties.

purpose and intent of the city's comprehensive plan and codified ordinances of
Johnstown, Ohio.

   (a)   The applicant for a TUP, as part of the application, must specify the
time needed to conduct the proposed temporary use. City Council, in their sole
discretion, may condition the approval of a TUP to align with the timing needs
of the proposed temporary use.
   (b)   The duration of a TUP shall not exceed six (6) months from the
approval of the TUP unless extended by City Council for up to an additional six
(6) months. In no case shall a TUP be active for more than twelve (12) months

shall be reviewed using the criteria established in Section
1132.07.
   (c)   The site of the temporary use must be returned to original condition
prior to expiration of the TUP.
(Ord. 13-2023. Passed 8-1-23.)

findings below. If the City Manager, or their designee, does not make all of
these findings, he or she shall recommend denial of the TUP.
      (1)   The establishment, maintenance, and operation of the use will not,
under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health,
safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood
of the proposed use.
      (2)   The use, as described and conditionally approved, will not be
detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to
the general welfare of the City.
      (3)   Approved measures for the removal of the use and site restoration
have been required to ensure that no changes to the site would limit the range
of potential permanent uses otherwise allowed by this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Conditions. In approving a TUP, the City Council may impose conditions
to ensure that the required findings can be made. Such conditions may include
but shall not be limited to the following:
      (1)   Measures to minimize impacts on adjacent uses, such as buffers and
screening, stormwater run-off best management practices, hours of operation,
lighting requirements, and/or parking measures.

by a temporary use shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or any other evidence of
the temporary use upon completion or removal of the use.
      (3)   Appropriate performance guarantees/security may be required before
initiation of the use to ensure proper cleanup after the use is finished.
      (4)   Other conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to
ensure that the approval complies with the findings above.
   (c)   Requests for TUP time extension. Requests to extend the initial TUP

addition to the temporary use-specific requirements established in this
chapter, all temporary uses must adhere to the regulations established below:

ensure that no changes to the site would limit the range of potential permanent
uses otherwise allowed by the existing zoning.
      (2)   Limitation on the duration of approved temporary structures to a
maximum of one year, so that temporary structures do not become permanent
structures.
      (3)   General site order and maintenance.

of the use.
   (b)   The physical permit, granted by approval of a TUP request, must be

(Ord. 13-2023. Passed 8-1-23.)
   1132.09 ALLOWABLE TEMPORARY USES.
   The temporary uses listed below may only be established after first
obtaining a valid (TUP). Uses that do not fall within the categories defined
below shall comply with the use and development regulations and permit
requirements that otherwise apply to the property.
   (a)   Construction Yard - Off Site.
      (1)   Definition. A "Construction Yard - Off Site" is a parcel, or
portion thereof, that is used for the temporary storage of materials, vehicles,
and/or equipment related to a construction project that is not located on the
same parcel. An example of a Construction Yard - Off Site is a parcel utilized
to store materials and equipment to support infrastructure improvements within
or adjacent to public rights-of-way which lack sufficient space to store these
goods without impeding vehicular and pedestrian traffic and/or creating public
safety concerns.
      (2)   Allowable Zoning Districts.  A Construction Yard - Off Site is only
allowable as a temporary use within the General Community Commercial (GCC-2),
Light Manufacturing (LM), and Planned Development (PD) zoning districts (so
long as the governing PD district allows for Temporary Uses in the approving
zoning text).
      (3)   Development Standards. The minimum standards necessary for a
Construction Yard - Off Site are as follows:
         A.   Setbacks.    Front: forty (40) feet
                  Side: twenty-five (25) feet
                  Rear: twenty-five (25) feet
         B.   Screening. All Construction Yard - Off Site uses must be enclosed
by a fence a minimum of six (6) feet in height fitted with screening panels to
block views of materials and equipment within the site to the general public.
The screening material shall be kept in good order and securely attached to the
fence through the duration of the TUP.
         C.   Ingress/Egress. Unless otherwise required by Fire/EMS access, a
Construction Yard - Off Site shall have one access point, equipped with a gate
or other access management device. This entry point shall be set back far
enough from the adjacent sidewalk or roadway so that vehicles waiting to enter
the site do not impede traffic flow on the adjacent sidewalk or roadway.
         D.   Where stabilized pavement does not exist, gravel or other
stabilization systems must be used to stabilize storage and vehicular
circulation areas in order to control erosion of soils, prevent permanent site
damage, and minimize dirt and debris leaving the site of the temporary use.

1133.01 GRANTING OF VARIANCES.
   In accordance with Ohio R. C. 713.11, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards
authorize such variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of land,
structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of variance.
1133.02  APPLICATION AND STANDARDS.
   Written application for a variance shall be made to the Zoning Inspector who
shall transmit such application to the Planning and Zoning Commission. Each
application for a variance shall be accompanied by the appropriate fee and
shall be paid to the Zoning Inspector, who shall deliver the same to the
Village Clerk-Treasurer. Each application shall be in written form and shall
contain the following:
   (a)    Name, address and phone number of applicants;
   (b)    Legal description of property;
   (c)    Description and nature of variance requested; and
   (d)    A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
      (1)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
      (2)   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance;
      (3)   That the special conditions and circumstances which create the need
for a variance do not result from the actions of the applicants;
      (4)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance, to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
         (Ord. 1983-20. Passed 8-16-83.)
   (e)   A list of the property owners of any property contiguous to and
directly across the street from the property for which the variance is
proposed, and the addresses of all such persons.
      (Ord. 1995-12. Passed 3-21-95.)
1133.03 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   Before approving or denying the application before it, the Planning
and Zoning Commission shall hold at least one public hearing on such
application within forty-five days after the receipt of an application for a
variance.
   (b)   Before holding a public hearing required in subsection (a) hereof,
notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the Village by two publications which shall be at least fourteen
days before the date of such hearing and at least seven days before the date of
such hearing, respectively. The notice to be published shall set forth the time
and place of public hearing and the nature of proposed variance.
   (c)   Before holding the public hearing required in subsection (a) hereof,
written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the chairperson of the
Planning and Zoning Commission, by certified mail to all owners of property
identified in Section
1133.02(e). The notifications shall contain the same information as required of
notices published in the newspaper as specified in subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Before holding the public hearing required in subsection (a) hereof,
written notice of such hearing shall be posted in a conspicuous location at the
Village offices. Such notice shall be posted at least fourteen days before the
date of such hearing.
   (e)   The applicant shall post one sign per public street frontage of the
subject property within fifteen (15) feet of the curb indicating the subject,
date, and time for the hearing. The sign(s) shall be posted at least ten (10)
days prior to the hearing. The sign(s) should be purchased at the Johnstown
City Offices and will measure no less than 2 feet by 3 feet.
   (f)   Within forty-five days after the public hearing required in subsection
(a) hereof the Commission shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions as specified in Section
1133.04 or disapprove the request for a variance. The Commission shall further
make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the
granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the land,
building or structure.
   (g)   The following factors shall be considered and weighed in the review
and the public hearing of an application for variance.
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without a variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the character of the neighborhood would be adversely
affected or whether adjoining properties would suffer an adverse impact as a
result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance; and
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (8)   No single factor shall be considered a determinative factor, and
the factors shall be weighed and balanced in determining whether a variance is
warranted. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof that the criteria for a
variance have been met and that application of the zoning requirement to the
applicant’s property would be inequitable.
         (Ord. 33-2021. Passed 8-17-21.)
1133.04 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance
as will, in its opinion, secure substantially the objectives of this Zoning
Ordinance. Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of
the terms under which the variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of
this Zoning Ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the Commission grant a
variance to allow a use not permissible under any of the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance in the district involved, or any use expressly or by implication
prohibited by the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in such district.

1141.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS.
   The Village is hereby divided into zoning districts under five general
categories known as residential districts, commercial districts, industrial
districts, planned unit development districts and special districts.
1141.02  ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSES.
   (a)    Residential Districts. The residential districts are intended to
provide land for one, two and multiple-family dwelling. Land uses which are not
related to or desirable for a residential environment are not permitted.
   (b)    Commercial Districts. The commercial districts are intended to
provide land for commercial expansion and new development in an orderly
efficient and efficient distribution of a wide variety of retail goods and
services to the public. Public use of these commercial areas introduces a
concern for an appropriate appearance, pleasing environmental scheme and
adequate safeguards for the public.
   (c)    Industrial Districts. Industrial districts are intended to encourage
the development of manufacturing, processing, warehousing, research and
testing, and wholesale business establishments which are clean, relatively
quiet, and free of hazardous or objectionable elements such as noise, odor,
dust, smoke or glare. While public use of these areas is anticipated to be
minimal, such public use is sufficient to create a concern for appropriate
appearance and adequate safeguards for the public health.
   (d)   Planned Unit Development Districts. Planned unit development districts
are intended to promote the development of large areas of land under a uniform
scheme or pattern.
   (e)   Special Districts. The special districts are intended to provide for
the orderly efficient development of areas with unique or unusual
characteristics.
   (f)   Agricultural District. Agricultural Districts are intended to
encourage the continued use of farmland for agricultural production.

   1165.01 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)    Purpose. The Planned Development (PD) District regulations are
intended to provide flexibility and creativity in terms of the types of uses
and improvements that may be developed and operated within a particular area.
The purposes of the PD District regulations are to:
           (1)    Facilitate master planning to provide for cohesive
development across multiple properties;
          (2)    Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not
permitted within standard municipal zoning district classifications to
facilitate the development and operation of uses in a manner that reflect
modern needs, market trends, and preferences.
      (3)    Allow for the creation of development standards that respect the
unique characteristics and qualities of a property and the immediate vicinity
and protect the community's natural resources.
           (4)    Enable more specific reviews of certain design
characteristics to ensure that a development project is properly integrated
into its surroundings and is compatible with or complimentary to adjacent
development.
           (5)    Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and
around the Planned Development District through appropriate development
controls.
           (6)    Pursue the goals of the City as defined in the city's major
policies and plans like the comprehensive land use plan. .
      (7)    Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce
infrastructure extension and long-term maintenance costs through unified
development.
           (8)    Provide for supporting community amenities such as (but not
limited to) parkland, paths, open spaces, and tree preservation areas.
           (9)    Establish objective criteria for development plan review that
ensure conformity to community and district standards and allow for consistent
treatment throughout.
           (10)    Encourage proper relationships between buildings, other
developments, structures, and land, and develop in an orderly, coordinated, and
comprehensive manner.
           (11)    Encourage unified development projects that exhibit
creative, holistic, and superior planning and design in ways that cannot be
achieved through a standard zoning district.
           (12)    Implement predictable and timely review procedures
applicable to Planned Development Districts.
   (b)    Application. The Planned Development District regulations assist in
accomplishing the above purposes by establishing review steps that combine the
request for a zoning of real property with the development plan review process
and, when applicable, the subdivision process.
         (1)    Separate Districts. Each Planned Development District shall be
considered a separate and unique zoning district wherein a preliminary
development plan (a "Preliminary Development Plan"), including (but not limited
to) an associated written text providing the specific development standards
applicable to the PD District (a "Zoning Text"), is adopted. The Preliminary
Development Plan shall pertain only to the property within the particular PD
District to which it applies. The approval of a Preliminary Development Plan
application also shall constitute a zoning amendment to a PD zoning designation
for the property that is the subject of the application.
         (2)    PD Supersedes Other Provisions. Planned Development Districts
adopted and established in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall
take precedence over any conflicting regulations contained in the City's
Planning and Zoning Code and/or Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)    Ownership/Control. A Planned Development District shall be an
integrated, unified development project wherein the entire project area that is
the subject of a single application shall be in common or shared ownership and/
or control at the time the application for Preliminary Development Plan
approval is filed. Any transfer of land within the Planned Development District
resulting in ownership within the development by additional or other parties
after an application has been filed shall not alter the applicability of the
regulations contained herein. An approved Preliminary Development Plan shall be
binding upon property owners and their successors and assigns.
   (d)    Eligibility. For property to be eligible to be classified with the PD
designation, it must be included within a Preliminary Development Plan
application pertaining to a minimum of three hundred fifty (350) acres, which
must be contiguous to one another. Properties separated by a public right-of-
way shall be contiguous for purposes of this provision.
   (e)    Additions. At any time after a Preliminary Development Plan
application containing a minimum of three hundred fifty (350) acres has been
approved so as to apply the PD designation thereto, separate property will be
eligible, but not guaranteed, to be zoned as an addition to the same PD,
regardless of whether or not it is contiguous to any of the acreage contained
within that PD, if (i) the separate property is owned or controlled by the same
applicant that filed the original PD application, or (ii) the separate property
is under common ownership with a portion of other real property that is already
zoned with that PD designation. In addition, non-contiguous separate real
property that is not contiguous with a boundary of an existing PD shall be
eligible to be added to the existing PD only if any portion of the boundary of
the separate property to be added is located within one half mile of a boundary
of the existing PD.
(Ord. 10-2023. Passed 6-20-23.)
   1165.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.    
   A Planned Development District shall be established according to the
following:
   (a)    Zoning. A request for zoning land to a Planned Development District
classification shall be made according to this Chapter
1165 by filing a Preliminary Development Plan application. All properties with
a PD classification shall be designated on the zoning map as "PD" plus initials
of the development name. The development name can be assigned by the applicant
or can be assigned by the City Manager as a unique identifier for the project
through its application and construction phases.
   (b)    Preliminary Development Plan. A Preliminary Development Plan
application shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission and City
Council in accordance with this Chapter
1165. An action by City Council to approve, approve with conditions, or
disapprove a Preliminary Development Plan application shall be deemed to
constitute the act of zoning and shall be considered to be a legislative
action.
   (c)    Final Development Plan. Final development plans (each, a "Final
Development Plan") shall be reviewed and acted upon for all proposed
developments which are not Major Economic Development Projects (such term being
defined in Section
1165.06(j)) by the relevant reviewing body in accordance with this Chapter
1165. A Final Development Plan application may include the entirety of the PD
District, or it may be submitted for part of the PD District in accord with any
commitments that were made in the approved Preliminary Development Plan with
regard to the phasing of development. All uses and developments within a PD
District which are not Major Economic Development Projects shall comply with an
approved Final Development Plan. An action by the relevant reviewing body to
approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove a Final Development Plan
application (or a permitted modification to or amendment thereof) shall be
deemed to constitute an administrative action.
   (d)    Certificate of Development Approval. A certificate of development
approval ("CODA") shall be reviewed and acted upon for all Major Economic
Development Projects (such term being defined in Section
1165.06(j)) by the Administrative Board of Review (such term being defined in
Section
1165.06(k)). Each use and development within a PD District which qualifies as a
Major Economic Development Project shall comply with an approved CODA. An
action by the Administrative Board of Review to approve, approve with
conditions, or disapprove a CODA application (or a permitted modification to or
amendment thereof) shall be deemed to constitute an administrative action.
   (e)    Plats. When a plat is necessary or required it shall be reviewed in
accordance with the City's Subdivision Regulations (see Part Eleven - Planning
and Zoning Code, Title One. Subdivision Regulations in the City of Johnstown
Codified Ordinance). An application for preliminary plat review and approval
may be filed at the same time as an application for Preliminary Development
Plan review and approval or Final Development Plan review and approval, or may
be filed at a later date. An application for final plat review and approval may
be filed at the same time as an application for Final Development Plan review
and approval or may be filed at a later date.
   (f)    Expiration of Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Text. Given the
nature of the PD District as providing for a Preliminary Development Plan and
Zoning Text having unique features suited to a particular time, the approval of
a Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Text shall expire on the third
anniversary of City Council approval of the Preliminary Development Plan and
Zoning Text unless construction has commenced on at least the first phase prior
to that date. Further, unless construction has commenced on at least seventy
percent (70%) of the total acreage of the PD District, the approval of a
Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Text shall expire as to property on
which construction has not commenced, on the eighth anniversary of Council
approval. At any time prior to expiration, the applicant may request and
Council may grant an extension of the Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning
Text approval for good cause shown.
   Upon expiration of Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Text approvals,
the property will retain its PD District zoning, but no construction or
development may proceed upon undeveloped property without approval of a new
Preliminary Development Plan and Zoning Text through the legislative process
established in this Chapter, or a rezoning to a different zoning district.
(Ord. 10-2023. Passed 6-20-23.)
   1165.03 PERMITTED AND CONDITIONAL USES.
   A PD District may allow for a single use or any combination of uses when
such uses are found to be compatible with one another in the context of a
Preliminary Development Plan and in keeping with the intent of the general
development criteria of the PD District, provided the proposed location of the
uses will not materially adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
   (a)    List of Uses. The specific uses to be included in the proposed PD
District shall be clearly listed in the Zoning Text. Uses in the Zoning Text
need not be listed as permitted uses or conditional uses in any other portion
of the City's Planning and Zoning Code, it being the intent that each PD
District is unique and may allow for the development and operation of uses
which may or may not be permitted in any other zoning district within the City.
Listed permitted, conditional, and accessory uses shall be defined by their
customary name or identification, except where they are specifically defined or
limited in the Planning and Zoning Code or the Zoning Text. Uses that are not
listed as permitted, conditional, or accessory uses in the Zoning Text shall be
prohibited.
   (b)    Designations of Uses. Uses shall be identified in the Zoning Text as
being permitted uses, conditional uses, or accessory uses. Any listed use may
be limited to certain areas delineated in the Preliminary Development Plan. A
PD District may include subareas, districts, or similar designations where only
certain uses are permitted and where particular development standards may be
applied to only a portion of the PD District. Conditional uses shall be
required to be reviewed in accordance with Chapter
1131, provided, however, that a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission
to deny a conditional use application may be appealed by the applicant to City
Council by filing a notice of the appeal with the City Council Clerk within
fifteen (15) days after such the Planning and Zoning Commission action is
taken. City Council shall then hold a hearing on the appeal at its next
regularly scheduled meeting that is at least fifteen (15) days after the City
Council Clerk's receipt of the appeal and shall make an administrative
determination of whether or not the denial of the conditional use was illegal,
arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of
substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the record.
      (Ord. 10-2023. Passed 6-20-23.)
   1165.04 STANDARDS - GENERALLY.
   The proposed PD District shall include development standards in the Zoning
Text to identify the allowable uses of land, buildings, and other structures;
building locations, bulk, layouts, arrangements, designs, and heights; the
percentages of lot areas that may be occupied; the setbacks of buildings from
public street rights-of-way and property lines; the sizes of yards and other
spaces; the density of development; and other matters relevant to the proposed
use and development. (Ord. 10-2023. Passed 6-20-23.)
   1165.05  PROJECT PHASING.
   If the PD District is to or may be developed in phases, each phase shall
have adequate provision for vehicular access, parking, storm water management,
utilities, and other public improvements to serve approved development within
that phase.
(Ord. 10-2023. Passed 6-20-23.)
   1165.06  PROCEDURES.
   (a)    General Provisions. Review of applications for Planned Development
Districts shall be conducted in compliance with the provisions of this Section
1165.06. Each application shall be reviewed for completeness and compliance
with applicable submission requirements, unless specific items are determined
by City staff to be inapplicable or unnecessary. If the application is deemed
insufficient, the City staff shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies.
Only complete applications shall be placed on a Planning and Zoning Commission
or City Council agenda.
   (b)    Concept Plan. Prior to submittal of any application for a PD, the
applicant shall meet with the appropriate staff of the City for the review of a
"Concept Plan" before the applicant files a Preliminary Development Plan
application. The Concept Plan is intended to outline the basic scope,
character, and nature of a proposed project. The review of the Concept Plan is
to provide input in the formative stages of design. The Concept Plan shall
include, at a minimum, a proposed general use diagram for property proposed for
development, an indication of anticipated proposed uses, and other information
which may be relevant to future proposed rezoning and development of the
property. The applicant may (but shall not be required to)  request review and
feedback of a Concept Plan from the City Council prior to preparing a
Preliminary Development Plan and filing a related application. If such a review
is requested, an application for review of a Concept Plan shall be filed with
City staff, which shall then forward it to City Council for review within
thirty (30) days of the filing of the application. No discussions, opinions, or
suggestions provided on any aspect of the Concept Plan shall bind the applicant
or the City.
   (c)    Zoning Amendment Request. The submittal of a Preliminary Development
Plan application to the City shall constitute an application for a zoning
amendment to a PD District classification with respect to the property that is
the subject of the application. The procedures, timing, and requirements for
filing and reviewing a Preliminary Development Plan application as provided in
this Chapter
1165 shall apply to the exclusion of the procedures, timing, and requirements
for other zoning amendment applications as provided in Chapter
1137. Any amendments to an approved Zoning Text and associated Preliminary
Development Plan shall update the original documents, to create a single source
of regulations for each PD. Amendments that only reference a previously
approved plan will not be accepted until such time as the governing Zoning Text
and Development Plan update the original documents accordingly.
   (d)    Preliminary Development Plan Review Procedures. An application for a
Preliminary Development Plan review and approval, including all submission
requirements for Preliminary Development Plans, shall be reviewed and
distributed according to the following procedures.
           (1)    Staff Review. After determining that the application is
complete pursuant to the requirements of Section
1165.08(a), the relevant City staff shall forward the application to the
appropriate City departments and, if determined necessary, professional
consultants, for review and comment. During their review, the staff may meet
with the applicant to review the application, and the applicant may revise the
application in response to staff's comments.
            (2)    Planning and Zoning Commission Review. After the application
has been deemed by City staff to be complete, the Preliminary Development Plan
application shall be placed on the agenda for the next regular meeting of the
Planning and Zoning Commission that meets all notice requirements of the PD
District. This meeting date cannot be less than twenty (20) days but no more
than forty (40) days from the application being deemed complete. The
Preliminary Development Plan application and supporting documentation, City
staff comments, any other reports prepared and any accompanying documents (such
as, but not limited to, letters from residents or maps) shall be transmitted to
the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to the meeting. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall review the application at a public hearing to determine
if it complies with the approval criteria set forth in this Section
1165.07(a). When reviewing the application the Planning and Zoning Commission
shall take into consideration any submitted plans, the Zoning Text, supporting
documentation and/or testimony from the applicant or its agents or consultants,
the City's Comprehensive Plan and/or other relevant plans and studies, staff
reports, staff and/or public comments, and expert opinions.
         A.   Request for Additional Information/Revisions. In its review of an
application, the Planning and Zoning Commission may request additional
information deemed reasonably necessary to adequately review and evaluate the
proposed development, and/or may request that the applicant revise elements of
the application. When this occurs, the Planning and Zoning Commission may table
the application. A tabled application will be scheduled for additional review
at the next regular meeting of the Planning and Zoning Commission following
receipt of the revised materials and schedule of revisions or amendments. The
applicant may request additional time to address the information that has been
requested by the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of its action to table
the case, in which case the Planning and Zoning Commission shall schedule
additional review of the application at the next regularly or specially
scheduled meeting that allows the applicant adequate time to provide the new
information.
         B.   Action by Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall recommend to City Council one of the following after
considering the approval criteria set forth in Section
 1165.07(a):
            (i)   That the Preliminary Development Plan and its supporting
documentation be approved as submitted;
            (ii)   That the Preliminary Development Plan and its supporting
documentation be approved with specific conditions set forth by the Planning
and Zoning Commission to further improve the proposed development; or
            (iii)   That the Preliminary Development Plan be disapproved.
         C.   Transmission to City Council. The Planning and Zoning Commission
shall transmit the Preliminary Development Plan application along with all
appropriate documentation, including a recommendation to City Council, within
seven (7) days of taking action.
      (3)    Review and Action by City Council. City Council shall review and
act on a single proposed ordinance to approve both the zoning of the relevant
property to the PD designation and the associated Preliminary Development Plan,
including conducting a public hearing, in accordance with City Council
procedures. Before holding the public hearing, notice of such hearing shall be
given by the City Council Clerk by posting on the website maintained by the
City at least seven (7) days before the date of such hearing. This notice shall
set forth the time and place of the public hearing, and the nature of the
proposed zoning amendment and Preliminary Development Plan as contemplated in
the application.
         A.   In reviewing the ordinance, City Council shall consider the
approval criteria set forth in Section
1165.07(a). Approval of the Preliminary Development Plan application shall be
required in order for a particular property to be classified with the PD
designation. City Council may accept or reject any conditions of approval of
the application as recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission, in whole
or in part, or it may add conditions either in addition to or in substitution
of conditions recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
         B.   Disapproval by City Council shall result in the property that is
the subject of the zoning/Preliminary Development Plan application retaining
the same zoning classification as applied to it prior to the filing of the
application.
         C.   Adoption of the ordinance to approve the Preliminary Development
Plan application shall constitute a rezoning of the property to a Planned
Development District, and the Preliminary Development Plan and associated

application as contemplated in Section
1165.08(j).
   A Final Development Plan application shall be reviewed according to the
following procedures:
          (1)    Staff Review. After determining that an application is
complete pursuant to the requirements of Section
 1165.08(b), the relevant City staff shall forward the application to the
appropriate city departments and, if determined necessary, professional
consultants, for review and comment. The application shall be reviewed for
compliance with the approved Preliminary Development Plan, and the requirements
of the Zoning Text, approved preliminary plats, and other relevant provisions
of City Code. During the course of their review, City staff may meet with the

any accompanying documents (such as but not limited to letters from residents
or maps) shall be transmitted to City Council prior to the meeting. At the
meeting, City Council first shall take action to determine if it will either
(A) review the Final Development Plan application so that it will make a
decision to approve it, approve it with conditions, or disapprove it, or (B)
refer the application to the Planning and Zoning Commission and delegate
authority to review and act upon the application to that body. If City Council
determines that it will retain the authority to make a decision on the
particular application, then immediately following its vote to retain such
authority it shall undertake a public review of and hearing on the application.
Should City Council determine that it will refer the application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission, then the Planning and Zoning Commission will
review the application at its first meeting that is at least seven (7) days
following the date when City Council took the action to refer the application.
Prior to the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, City staff shall provide
the members of the Planning and Zoning Commission with copies of the same
documents and materials which were provide to City Council for the same

Final Development Plan application, the reviewing body may request additional
information deemed necessary to adequately review and evaluate the proposed
development, and/or may request the applicant to revise elements of the
application. When this occurs, the reviewing body may table the application. A
tabled application will be scheduled for additional review at the next regular
meeting of the reviewing body following receipt of the revised materials and a
schedule of revisions or changes, unless the applicant requests additional time
to address the information that has been requested, in which case the reviewing
body shall schedule additional review of the application at the next regularly
or specially scheduled meeting that allows the applicant adequate time to
provide the new information.
      (4)   Review Standard. In reviewing the Final Development Plan
application, the reviewing body shall determine if the Final Development Plan
complies with all specific requirements, purposes, intent, and basic objectives
of the Preliminary Development Plan, and any commitments made or conditions
agreed to with the adoption of the Preliminary Development Plan, and if
determines that there is such compliance, it shall act to approve the
application.
      (5)   Minor Text or Plan Modifications. The reviewing body for a Final
Development Plan shall review and approve or disapprove of requests for minor
text and/or plan modifications within the PD District, and may, in reviewing
that Final Development Plan or a requested modification thereto, approve a
minor text modification from one or more provisions of the approved Zoning Text
or other elements of the approved Preliminary Development Plan, if it
determines that all of the following provisions are satisfied:
         A.   The proposed modification(s) do not alter the list of permitted,
conditional, or accessory uses or cause an increase in permitted density of
development;
         B.   The proposed modification(s) result in a development of
equivalent or higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict
application of the requirement(s); and
         C.   The development, with the modification(s) as proposed on the
Final Development Plan, will have no adverse impacts upon the surrounding
properties or upon the health, safety, or general welfare of the community.
   
   (f)    Action on a Final Development Plan Application. The reviewing body
for a particular Final Development Plan application shall take one of the
following actions thereon:
      (1)    Approve the application as submitted, including any requested
deviations from the approved Preliminary Development Plan;
      (2)    Approve the Final Development Plan with modification(s) as agreed
to by the applicant and/or with deviations that the required reviewing body
approves; or
            (3)    Disapprove the Final Development Plan when the application
does not demonstrate that the required standards have been met. Disapproval of
the Final Development Plan shall terminate the process, subject to any
applicable administrative appeal rights. The applicant may file a revised Final
Development Plan application if it receives a vote of disapproval on a previous
application. Such action shall be considered a new application for review and
shall contain all the information required for a Final Development Plan.
   (g)    Permits. Following the approval of a Final Development Plan, the
applicant may proceed with the certificate of zoning compliance and building
permit process for the property and the development that was the subject
thereof, consistent with approval as granted.

applicable land areas that are to be dedicated to the City for the property
that was the subject of the Final Development Plan.
      (3)    Required covenants, easements, and restrictions (if any) shall be
recorded prior to the approval of any building permit in a location where such
covenants, easements, or restrictions are intended to apply. The City may
require a copy of the recorded document prior to issuing any building permit.
      (4)    All construction and development under any building permit shall
be in accordance with the approved Final Development Plan, as may be amended
pursuant to Section
1165.04(i). Any unauthorized departure from such plan shall be cause for
revocation of the certificate of zoning compliance.
   (h)    Appeal of Disapproved Final Development Plan. When a Final
Development Plan application (or an application for an amended Final
Development Plan, as provided in the immediately following subsection (i)) is
disapproved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, an applicant may file an
administrative appeal to City Council by filing a notice of the appeal with the
City Council Clerk within fifteen (15) days after such disapproval action is
taken. City Council shall then hold a hearing on the appeal at its next
regularly scheduled meeting that is at least fifteen (15) days after the City
Council Clerk's receipt of the appeal and shall make an administrative
determination of whether or not the disapproval of the Final Development Plan
was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the
preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the record.
When a Final Development Plan application (or an application for an amended
Final Development Plan, as provided in the immediately following subsection
(i)) is disapproved by City Council as the reviewing body or after hearing an
appeal of a Planning and Zoning Commission decision to disapprove a Final
Development Plan application, an applicant may file an administrative appeal in
court in accordance with applicable state law.
   (i)   Modifications to Approved Final Development Plans. Requested
modifications to the approved Final Development Plan(s) shall be reviewed
according to the following:
         (1)    Administrative Approval. The City Manager, or designee, in
administering the approved Final Development Plan and Zoning Text, may
authorize minor plan modifications to building layouts, parking arrangements,
sign locations, lighting, and other site-related improvements that are required
to correct any errors or address changes to the site made necessary during
construction, provided the modifications remain consistent with the purpose of
the approved Final Development Plan and Zoning Text.
           (2)    No administrative modifications shall be made that increase
the permitted density of development or add to the list of permitted or
conditional uses.
           (3)    Modifications deemed minor ("Minor Modifications") may
include such changes as:
         A.   Minor adjustments in lot lines provided no additional lots are
created. adequate buildable space is maintained, and required setbacks are
maintained;
         B.   Minor adjustments in the location of and layout of parking lots
provided the required perimeter setbacks, tree island coverage, yards and
buffers are maintained;
         C.   Minor adjustments in building footprints up to three percent
(3.0%) in total floor area of the originally approved building, building height
(s) or floor plans, that do not alter the character or intensity of the use
thereof;
         D.   Substitution of landscaping materials specified in the landscape
plan with comparable materials of an equal or greater size;
         E.   Redesigning and/or relocating stormwater management facilities
provided that general character and stormwater capacities are maintained;

City Council and the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (4)    Amended Final Development Plan. Modifications other than Minor
Modifications shall be submitted to the reviewing body that approved the
original Final Development Plan as part of an application for an amended Final
Development Plan. Modifications as part of an amended Final Development Plan
shall be approved provided that the reviewing body finds that the modifications
remain consistent with the approved Preliminary Development Plan or warrant any
necessary deviation therefrom. The reviewing body for the amended Final
Development Plan shall have the right and power to grant such deviations as
administrative action. If approved, amendments to the Final Development Plan
shall supersede the originally approved Final Development Plan.
   (j)   Certificate of Development Approval.  An application for a certificate
of development approval (a "CODA") shall be required for a Major Economic
Development Project. The term "Major Economic Development Project" shall mean
"a development containing at least 50,000 square feet of gross building floor
area one or more of the following land uses: administrative or professional
office uses; medical office uses; research and development facilities;
warehousing and/or distribution facilities; data centers; industrial,
manufacturing, assembly, and/or production uses, and other uses which are
identified as Major Economic Development Projects in an approved Zoning Text."
In no circumstance will retail or restaurant use be eligible for Major Economic
Development Project designation unless they are clearly accessory to and
contained within the same building as any use that qualifies as a Major
Economic Development Project absent the square footage contained within the
proposed retail or restaurant use. The intent behind subjecting Major Economic
Development Projects to the CODA application review process (rather than the
Final Development Plan review process) is to enhance the speed-to-market of
"shovel-ready" sites that are attractive to employment-generating uses and
developments and/or uses which otherwise will bring significant private
investments to the City. Decisions on CODA applications shall be deemed to be
administrative in nature.
   (k)   Administrative Board of Review. An Administrative Board of Review
("ABR") is hereby created to review CODA applications. The ABR shall consist of
the Council representative on the Planning and Zoning Commission; and two
members of Council, appointed by a majority vote of Council. The members shall
elect a Chair from among themselves. In addition, the City Manager and the
Planning Director shall be non-voting ex officio members of the ABR who shall
have privilege of participating in ABR deliberations. The ABR shall have the
duty to review and approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove of CODA
applications (and permitted modifications thereof) in accordance with the
requirements of the PD District and other applicable provisions of City Code.
The ABR shall meet at least twice per calendar month on dates determined by the
ABR, provided that meetings may be cancelled by the Chair when no CODA
applications are ready for review by the ABR. Special meetings of the ABR may
be called by any member of the ABR with at least twenty-four (24) hours' prior
written notice being delivered by email or other written means to the other
members of the ABR and otherwise in compliance with open meetings laws.
   (l)   CODA Application Review Process. A CODA application shall be reviewed
according to the following procedures:
           (1)    Staff Review. After determining that an application is
complete pursuant to the requirements of Section
1165.08(c), the relevant City staff shall forward the application to the
appropriate city departments and, if determined necessary, professional
consultants for review and comment. The application shall be reviewed for
compliance with the approved Preliminary Development Plan, and the requirements
of the Zoning Text and other relevant provisions of City Code. During the
course of their review, City staff may meet with the applicant to review the
application, and the applicant may revise the CODA application in response to
staff's comments.
      (2)    ABR Review. After the CODA application has been deemed by City
staff to be complete, it shall be forwarded to the ABR for review at its next
regularly scheduled meeting that is at least fifteen (15) days and no more than
thirty (30) days after the date when the CODA application was unless City staff
deemed the filing to be incomplete, in which case the application shall be
reviewed by the ABR at its next regularly scheduled meeting that is at least
fifteen (15) days and no more than thirty (30) days after the date when all
deficient CODA application materials have been filed by the applicant with City
staff. City staff shall provide to the ABR any comments on the submittal as it
deems to be necessary or appropriate as well as copies of the previously
approved Preliminary Development Plan application, Zoning Text, and other
related documents. At the ABR meeting, the ABR shall review the application to
determine if it complies with the approval criteria set forth in Section
1165.07(c). The review of the CODA application is limited to a determination as
to whether or not the plans and specifications for development of a site that
have been submitted in conjunction with the CODA application comply with the
approved Preliminary Development Plan which applies to that site.
      (3)   Request for Additional Information/Revisions. In its review of a
CODA application, the ABR may request additional information deemed necessary
to adequately review and evaluate the proposed development, and/or may request
the applicant to revise elements of the application. When this occurs, the ABR
may table the application. A tabled application will be scheduled for
additional review at the next regular meeting of the ABR unless the applicant
requests additional time to address the information that has been requested, in
which case the reviewing body shall schedule additional review of the
application at the next regularly or specially scheduled meeting that allows
the applicant adequate time to provide the new information.
      (4)   Review Standard. In reviewing the CODA application, the ABR shall
determine if the plans and specifications that are part of the application
comply with all specific requirements, purposes, intent, and basic objectives
of the Preliminary Development Plan, and any commitments made or conditions
agreed to with the adoption of the Preliminary Development Plan. If it
determines that there is such compliance, it shall act to approve the
application, and if it determines that there is no such compliance, it shall
table the application and provide written comments to the applicant identifying
the items that do not substantially comply with the approved Preliminary
Development Plan. The applicant may then revise the CODA application to address
the comments, and the ABR shall review the revised submission at its next
regularly scheduled meeting that is at least seven (7) days after the revision
submission has been filed by the applicant with City staff. If the ABR
determines that the revised application substantially complies with the
approved Preliminary Development Plan, it shall approve the same, and if it
determines that the revised application does not comply, then it may disapprove
the revised application.
      (5)   Minor Text or Plan Modifications. The ABR shall review and approve
or disapprove of requests for minor text and/or plan modifications for Major
Economic Development Projects, and may, in reviewing a CODA application,
approve a minor text modification from one or more provisions of the approved
Zoning Text or other elements of the approved Preliminary Development Plan, if
it determines that all of the following provisions are satisfied:
         A.   The proposed modification(s) do not alter the list of permitted,
conditional, or accessory uses or cause an increase in permitted density of
development;
         B.   The proposed modification(s) result in a development of
equivalent or higher quality than that which could be achieved through strict
application of the requirement(s);
         C.   The development, with the modification(s) as proposed on the
Final Development Plan, will have no adverse impacts upon the surrounding
properties or upon the health, safety, or general welfare of the community.
   (m)    Permits - Major Economic Development Projects. Following the approval
of a CODA application, the applicant:.
         (1)    Shall obtain all engineering permits, a zoning certificate
pursuant to Chapter
1127, and a building permit prior to commencing construction of improvements on
the property that was the subject of the approved CODA application.
         (2)    A zoning certificate and building permit shall not be issued
until any required final plat has been recorded and the City has accepted any
applicable land areas that are to be dedicated to the City.
         (3)    Required covenants, easements, and restrictions (if any) shall
be recorded prior to the approval of any building permit in a location where
such covenants, easements, or restrictions are intended to apply. The City may
require a copy of the recorded document prior to issuing any building permit.
      (4)    All construction and development under any building permit shall
be in accordance with the approved CODA, including any modifications as may be
provided in subsection (o). Any unauthorized departure from such plan shall be
cause for revocation of the zoning certificate.
   (n)    Appeal of CODA Application Decision. When a CODA application (or an
application for an amended CODA, as provided in the immediately following
subsection (o)) is finally approved or disapproved by the ABR, an applicant or
aggrieved party may file an administrative appeal to City Council by filing a
notice of the appeal with the City Council Clerk within fifteen (15) days after
such disapproval action is taken. City Council shall then hold a hearing on the
appeal at its next regularly scheduled meeting that is at least fifteen (15)
days after the City Council Clerk's receipt of the appeal and shall make an
administrative determination of whether or not the decision on the CODA
application was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by
the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the
record. Appeal of a Council decision shall proceed as provided in state law for
court review of political subdivision administrative actions.
   (o)   Modifications to Approved CODA. Requested modifications to approved
CODAs shall be reviewed according to the following:
         (1)    Administrative Approval. The City Manager, or designee, in
administering an approved CODA and Zoning Text, may authorize minor plan
modifications to building layouts, parking arrangements, sign locations,
lighting, and other site-related improvements that are required to correct any
errors or address changes to the site made necessary during construction,
provided the modifications remain consistent with the purpose of the approved
CODA and Zoning Text. The City Manager may also authorize other Minor
Modifications in accordance with the same requirements as apply to Minor
Modifications of Final Development Plans. The City Manager, or designee, shall
report approved modifications to City Council.
         (2)    Amended CODA.  Modifications other than Minor Modifications
shall be submitted to City Council as part of an application for an amended
CODA. Modifications as part of an amended CODA shall be approved provided that
City Council finds that the modifications remain consistent with the approved
CODA or warrant any deviation therefrom. If approved, amendments to the CODA
shall supersede the originally approved CODA.

   1165.09 SPECIAL PD REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKLAND AND PRIVATELY OWNED OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Applicability.  Except as set forth in Section
1165.09(c), for each residential unit that is to be constructed within a PD,
the applicant or property owner shall be required to dedicate to the City, or
it's designee, at no charge, 1,500 square feet of land area to be used and/or
preserved as publicly owned parkland. A Preliminary Development Plan and/or
Zoning Text shall make commitments to providing certain sizes and locations of
parkland, but in all circumstances the actual locations and sizes of parkland
shall be provided in Final Development Plan applications or CODA applications
for review and approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, parkland need not be
located on the property but must be inside the city's municipal comprehensive
planning area and which is the subject of a Final Development Plan application
or a CODA application.
   In order to ensure that reasonable amounts of common areas and green space
are provided for within the PD District, common areas and green space areas
shall be established and evaluated separately from the parkland requirement.
   The Zoning Text, Preliminary Development Plan, and/or Final Development Plan
shall provide details as to any proposed improvements within the privately
owned open spaces, green spaces and common areas, whether such spaces shall be
open to public use or are to be privately used, and the manner in which the
proposed improvements shall be maintained
   (b)   Sizes and Specifications.  No single dedication of parkland to the
City shall be less than one acre in size. Wet and dry stormwater basins
(existing or proposed by the applicant) shall not be considered to be parkland.
Property that is dedicated to the City as parkland shall have frontage on an
existing or platted public street, or shall be accessible from an existing or
planned public street and sidewalk by vehicles and pedestrians by and through a
permanent easement through other property or adjacent parkland. Parkland shall
meet one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)    It shall contain significant tree stands, forested areas,
watercourses, or other natural features which may be preserved by coming under
public ownership;
      (2)    It shall provide adequate areas for the development and operation
of active or passive recreational activities such as, but not limited to,
playgrounds, leisure or other pedestrian trails, hiking, ballfields, and
fishing; and/or
      (3)   It shall contain historical, archeological, or special geographical
features which may be preserved by coming under public ownership.
   (c)   Fees In-Lieu of Parkland Dedication. Parkland dedications may be
waived when City Council has adopted a resolution, for a particular applicant,
to accept payment-in-lieu fees instead of accepting land dedication. Upon the
request of an applicant, City Council may accept the payment-in-lieu fees if it
determines that one of the following criteria have been met:
      (1)   The features of available parkland within the PD District are less
desirable than other possible parkland acquisitions elsewhere within or near
the City;
      (2)   The use of payment-in-lieu fees will serve a broader public purpose
than dedication of parkland within the PD District by being available to
acquire parkland in other locations should such opportunities arise;
   Payment-in-lieu fees shall be placed into a designated City fund for future
parkland acquisitions to benefit current and future residents. These fees shall
be calculated by taking the product of (i) forty-five thousand dollars
($45,000.00) and (ii) the number of acres of parkland dedication that is to be
offset by the payment. The dollar value in the immediately preceding subsection
(i) automatically shall increase by seven percent (7.0%) over the then-
effective value on the third (3rd) anniversary of the effective date of the
original adoption of this Chapter
1165 and on each third (3rd) anniversary thereafter.
   (d)   Timing of Dedication(s).  No zoning certificate shall be issued by the
City for a residential unit until such time as the applicant has met the
parkland dedication requirements or made payments-in-lieu of parkland
dedication as required under this Section
1165.09.
   (e)   Operations and Maintenance.
      (1)   All parkland shall be preserved for its intended purpose as
expressed in a Preliminary Development Plan, Final Development Plan, or in
plans approved as part of a CODA application. No conservation area shall be
cleared, graded, filled, or subject to construction.
      (2)   Dedication of parkland to the City is subject to formal acceptance
by City Council. City Council may, but shall not be required to, accept
undivided parkland provided:
         A.   Such land is accessible to all residents of the City; and
         B.   There is no cost of acquisition other than any costs incidental
to the transfer of ownership such as title insurance; and
         C.   The City agrees to and has access to maintain such lands. Where
the City accepts dedication of parkland that contains improvements, the City
may require the posting of financial security to ensure structural integrity of
said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements for a term
not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of dedication.
The amount of financial security shall not exceed fifteen (15) percent of the
actual cost of installation of said improvements.
      (3)   The developer or owner of land within a PD District shall cause
privately owned open space, green space, and common areas to be maintained by:
         A.   Establishing an association or nonprofit corporation of all
individuals or corporations owning property within a designated area to ensure
ongoing maintenance; and/or
         B.   Retaining ownership, control and maintenance .
      (4)   Land designated as parkland will be restricted by an appropriate
legal instrument satisfactory to the City Attorney as parkland perpetually, or
for a period of not less than ninety-nine (99) years. Such instrument shall be
binding upon and enforceable by the City and the developer, and their
respective successors and assigns, and shall constitute a covenant running with
the land. Such instrument shall be in recordable form.
      (5)   All recreational facilities and amenities within privately owned
open spaces, green spaces, and common areas shall be specifically included in
the development schedule and shall be constructed and fully improved by the
developer at an equivalent or greater rate than the construction of residential
structures, or the development order will be in default.
   (f)   Ownership Standards. Should the developer elect to maintain privately
owned open space, green space, and/or common areas through an association or
nonprofit corporation, said organization shall conform to the following
requirements:
      (1)   The developer must establish the association or nonprofit
corporation prior to the sale of any lots or parcels that are governed thereby.
      (2)   The developer shall provide a description of the association,
including the bylaws and methods for maintaining the privately owned open
space, green space, and/or common areas, prior to the issuance of a building
permit for the first development that is to be subject to the association or
nonprofit corporation.
      (3)   Membership in the association or nonprofit corporation shall be
mandatory for all property owners within the relevant development.
      (4)   The association or nonprofit corporation shall manage all
recreational and cultural facilities and amenities that are not dedicated to
the public, shall provide for the maintenance, administration and operation of
said land, and shall secure adequate liability insurance on the land.
      (5)   The association or nonprofit corporation shall be responsible for
maintenance of liability insurance and the payment of real property taxes
relating to open space, green space, and common areas ,.
      (6)   The members of the association shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining the open space, green space, and common areas.
   (g)   Maintenance Standards.
      (1)   In the event that the association, nonprofit corporation or any
successor organization shall, at any time after establishment of a development
containing privately owned open space, green space, and/or common areas, fail
to maintain the same in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the City may serve written notice of the failure upon the
owner of record, setting forth the manner in which the owner of record.
      (2)   Failure to adequately maintain open space, green space, and/or
common areas in reasonable condition constitutes a violation of this chapter.

1179.01 PURPOSE.
   The City, recognizing that with increased urbanization and population growth
comes increased demands for well-organized residential areas which take into
account unique natural features, historic preservation, contemporary land use
concepts, and a balanced residential environment, hereby provides for the
Single Family Planned Residential District to promote the variety and
flexibility of land development for single family residential purposes that are
necessary to meet these demands while still preserving and enhancing the
health, safety and general welfare of the residents of Johnstown.
(Ord. 12-2022. Passed 7-5-22.)
1179.02 APPLICATION.
   The owner of any parcel consisting of ten (10) acres or greater, may submit
an application for change in the zoning under the provisions of this chapter of
the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 12-2022. Passed 7-5-22.)
1179.03 PERMITTED USES.
   Within the Single Family Planned Residential District (SFPRD) the following
uses, developed in strict compliance with the approved development plan and
standards, shall be permitted:
   (a)   Single family dwelling.
   (b)   Accessory buildings and accessory uses incidental to the principal
building or use.
   (c)   Non-residential uses of a religious, cultural, educational, or
recreational nature or character to the extent that they are designed and
intended to serve the residents of the Single Family Planned Residential
District. Said facilities may be designed to serve adjoining neighborhoods or
residents if they are located in such proximity to the major thoroughfares as
to permit access without burdening residential streets.
   (d)   Temporary non-residential structures such as construction trailers and
temporary buildings of a non-residential character may be used incident to
construction work on the premises or on adjacent public projects or during the
period while a permanent structure is being constructed. The user of said
structure shall obtain a permit for such temporary use, which permit shall be
valid for six (6) months and may be renewed at the discretion of the zoning
inspector on finding of reasonable progress toward completion of the permanent
structure or project. The zoning inspector may require provisions for sanitary
waste disposal, solid waste disposal and water supply. The fees for such permit
and renewals thereof shall be established by the Johnstown City Council. Said
temporary structure shall be removed not later than ten (10) days after
expiration of said permit, and/or the issuance of the Zoning Certificate of
Compliance regarding such permanent structure. In no event shall such temporary
structure be utilized for any residential use.
   (e)   Golf course community that includes a public or private golf course
with all buildings and club houses incident thereto, integrated with
residential uses permitted by this Section
1179.03. The golf course shall be subsidiary to the primary residential use of
the property.

be required to re- apply for a continuation and/or modification of such use(s)

upon the basis of the definitions, purposes, requirements and conditions set
forth in this Ordinance, excepting that, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, public or private golf courses, with all buildings and club houses
incident thereto, may be designated as "recreational open space" when
integrated into a golf course community as permitted by this section. Such open
space shall be designed to provide active recreation, passive recreation, the
preservation of natural site amenities or any combination thereof. Any
buildings, structures and improvements to the open space must be appropriate to
the uses which are authorized for the open space, having regard to its
topography and unimproved condition. The open space shall be of a size, shape

Single Family Planned Residential District. Public utility and similar
easements, rights-of-way for streets and roads, and right-of-ways for water
courses and other similar channels are not acceptable for common open space
dedication unless such land or right- of-way is usable as a trail or similar
purpose and has been approved by the Zoning Commission. Storm water retention
or detention facilities are acceptable for dedication as Maintained Passive
Open Space, provided such facilities do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
total open space required. The responsibility for the maintenance of all open
spaces shall be specified by the developer in writing before approval of the
development plan. The open space reserved in a Single Family Planned
Residential District shall be dedicated to, and permanently owned by, a
homeowners' association that shall have title to the land for the use of each
owner who buys property within the development. Such open space shall be used
only for the purposes for which it is designated upon the approved development
plan, and in accordance with the approved development plan. The legal articles
relating to the organization of the homeowners' association are subject to
review and approval by the Zoning Commission and shall provide adequate
provisions for the perpetual care and maintenance of all common areas. Such
legal articles shall be inserted into the chain of title of the land within the
Single Family Planned Residential District. All open space shall be prohibited

   (i)   Access. A minimum of two forms of ingress and egress are required
unless approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (j)   Landscaping. Reference Chapter
1183 for landscaping standards. Landscape plans shall be submitted with the
subdivision plat and shall be subject to approval in the same manner required
of the subdivision plat. All such landscaping shall be maintained and kept in
accordance with the landscape plan as submitted, and such maintenance and
upkeep shall be the responsibility of the owner of such yard, space or area.
All vacant lots shall be kept seeded or maintained in such manner as to prevent
erosion of the property and excess drainage onto adjoining lands.
   (k)   Parking. Off street parking shall be provided, at the time of
construction of the main structure or building, with adequate provisions for
ingress and egress according to the development plan. In preparing and
approving the parking plan the provisions of Chapter
1175 shall, when appropriate, be incorporated.
   (l)   Signs. Signs shall comply with Chapter
1177. Signs permitted in SR-1, SR-2, UR-1 and UR-2 districts are permitted in
PUD districts.
   (m)   Building Height Limits.  No building in this district shall exceed

the development plan and may be leased to a secondary entity for the
development of the golf course, but the use shall remain as open space in
perpetuity and shall not be conveyed by the homeowner's association to any
entity other than the City, if such conveyance is mutually agreed. If the golf
course is leased, and the golf course use is abandoned for a continuous period
of twelve (12) months or more, the possession of the golf course, including all
buildings, structures and improvements, shall revert to the homeowner's
association. Unless conveyance to the City occurs, the perpetual care and
maintenance of the golf course shall be the ultimate responsibility of the
homeowner's association.
         B.   Additional open space, beyond that which must otherwise be
provided, shall be required if access to the golf course area by residents of
the golf course community is restricted or requires payment of a fee, other

CHAPTER 1184
Agricultural Buffering and Mitigation
1184.01    Urban/agricultural conflict mitigation.
1184.02    Application steps.
1184.03    Mitigation standards.
1184.04    Deviations.
Appendix I - List of Acceptable Trees
1184.01 URBAN/AGRICULTURAL CONFLICT MITIGATION.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of these standards is to mitigate the potential
for conflict between farming activities and urban uses. The mitigation
provisions of this chapter seek to achieve the following objectives:
      (1)   Minimize the impacts of urban development on agricultural
production activities.
      (2)   Minimize the potential for complaints about agricultural practices
and activities.
      (3)   Ensure the continued use of agricultural land for agricultural
uses.
      (4)   Minimize potential conflict by developing a well-defined boundary
between agricultural and urban uses. The best boundary will be one that
minimizes conflict in both directions.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions apply only to this chapter:
      (1)   "Agricultural land uses" means the use of land for the cultivation
and husbandry of plant and animal products, including agricultural activities
permitted on land zoned exclusive farm use (Agriculture).
      (2)   "Mitigation area" means a management zone of varying size, shape,
and characteristics between different land uses that uses combinations of
mitigation elements to buffer between agricultural land and urban land uses.
      (3)   "Mitigation element" means a physical or legal feature within a
mitigation area that mitigates an adverse impact. A mitigation element may
consist of vegetation, transportation and utility corridors, natural barriers,
deed restrictions, or other natural or manmade features.
      (4)   "Spray drift" means airborne movement of agricultural chemicals
onto a non-target area.
      (5)   Urban Receptor, Sensitivity Of.
         A.   Urban Receptor, Higher-Sensitivity (H).
            i.    Residential use.
            ii.    Motel, hotel, or hostel.
            iii.    Place of worship; public meeting facility.
            iv.    Child care center, kindergarten, school, university, or
other educational institution.
            v.    Medical center or hospital.
            vi.    Public or quasi-public use, such as library, park, etc.
            vii.    Other similar uses.
         B.   Urban Receptor, Lower-Sensitivity (L).
            i.    Commercial use, except for any defined as higher-sensitivity
urban receptor.
            ii.    Industrial use.
            iii.    All other uses not classified here.
   (c)   Description of Impacts Requiring Mitigation.
      (1)   Spray Drift. Principally, spray drift is caused by agricultural
chemical use, but can apply to urban use of agrochemicals. Separation between
urban and agricultural uses is the preferred tool to mitigate the impact of the
spray drift, employing either large setbacks or a combination of smaller
setbacks and a tree buffer.
      (2)   Trespass and Vandalism. Trespass and vandalism are often considered
by farmers to be the most serious adverse potential impact to agricultural
operations in proximity to urban areas. Climb-resistant, trespass-inhibiting
fences and/or hedges in the mitigation area are the means of reducing these
impacts, as is placing the buffer in individual ownership (such as larger urban
lots with strict setback requirements).
      (3)   Odor. Odor is one of the less important agriculture-related adverse
impacts. Unless there are site- specific reasons why mitigation of odor is
critical (such as the presence of a livestock feed lot), issues with odor are
sufficiently addressed by requiring that owners of new urban development within
1,000 feet of agricultural land receive notice through an explicitly worded
deed declaration of the potential adverse impacts to which they will likely be
exposed as a result of living within 1,000 feet of agricultural land.
      (4)   Dust, Smoke, and Ash. Like odor, this grouping of potential adverse
impacts is one of the least important agriculture-related issues in the region,
and, like odor, can be addressed by the use of a deed declaration.
      (5)   Runoff. Stormwater and irrigation runoff arise from both urban and
agricultural uses, and can adversely impact agricultural operations as well as
urban health and livability. Impacts may be avoided or significantly reduced by
employing erosion-prevention and erosion-control measures during construction,
and by an adequate stormwater plan for urban development that takes into
account impacts from and on the adjacent agricultural land.
      (6)   Noise. Noise is an impact arising from agricultural operations.
This section contains no noise mitigation requirements, but applicants are
encouraged to consider community design and construction practices that provide
some level of noise mitigation.

      (3)   Different degrees of mitigation are required of the applicant based
on the following factors: the sensitivity of the adjoining urban use to
agricultural impacts and the impact being buffered; the intensity of uses on
the adjacent Agriculture land.
   (b)   Application. Agricultural Impact Assessment Report. As part of any
application for development or use of land which is adjacent to agriculture
(refer to subsection (d) of this section) and where the agricultural mitigation
standards in Section
1184.03 apply, an applicant shall supply the planning department with a report
entitled "Agricultural Impact Assessment Report" (AIAR). The purpose of the
AIAR is to provide the approving authority with sufficient evidence to
determine agricultural intensity and to evaluate the applicant's proposed
method of complying with the provisions of this section. The AIAR shall include
the following components:
      (1)   Map showing the zoning of land adjacent and within 200 feet of the
property proposed for urban development.
      (2)   A description of the type and nature of agricultural uses and
farming practices, if any, which presently occur on adjacent lands zoned
Agriculture and sources of such information. The information thus required, if
applicable, shall include:
         A.   Method of irrigation (if proposed).
         B.   Types of agricultural production and practices for the five
preceding years.
         C.   Type of agricultural equipment customarily used on the property.
      (3)   Detailed information obtained from the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) concerning soils which occur on adjacent lands
zoned Agriculture, and whether the land has access to water for irrigation.
      (4)   Wind pattern information.
      (5)   A description of the measures proposed to comply with the
requirements of subsection (d) of this section and Section 1184.03.
      (6)   The persons who prepared said report and all persons, agencies, and
organizations contacted during preparation of the report.
      (7)   All statements shall be documented, sources given as reference, and
any other detailed information needed to substantiate conclusions should be
provided in the appendices.
      (8)   If the applicant is requesting a deviation from the standards of
this section, the agricultural impact assessment report shall not be deemed to
be complete unless accompanied by the conflict assessment and mitigation study
described in Section
1184.04(a)(4).
      (9)   A list of acceptable plant type
      (10)   A plan and narrative, including best practices and other industry
standards, to incorporate existing natural vegetation and trees to the required
buffer area.
   (c)   Review Process.
      (1)   Using the definitions of these classifications herein and the
evidence of the AIAR, the approving authority shall determine:
         A.   Whether the applicant's proposed mitigation plan meets the
standards of this section.
      (2)   The approving authority shall approve, approve with conditions, or
deny the AIAR and its proposals and conclusions.
   (d)   Mitigation Requirements.
      (1)   All mitigation elements will be sited on urban land unless
arrangements have been made with the adjacent agricultural land owner to site
some or all elements on agricultural land.
      (2)   Mitigation for Agriculture. To minimize or mitigate the potential
adverse impacts associated with the proximity of urban and agricultural land
uses, the following measures shall be undertaken by the applicant when urban
development is proposed adjacent to land which is in agricultural use:
         A.   Setbacks as illustrated in Section
 1184.03(a), Figure 1, either alone or in conjunction with a tree buffer;
         B.   Tree buffer as illustrated in Section
1184.03(b), Figures 2 and 3,
 1184.03(c), Figure 4, and described in Section
1184.03(b)(1) through (6);
         C.   Screening shrubs (only in conjunction with a tree buffer) as
illustrated in Section
1184.03(b), Figure 2, and described in Section
1184.03(d);
         D.   Trespass-inhibiting hedges/fencing as illustrated in Section
1184.03(b), Figure 2, and described in Section
1184.03(e);
         E.   Deed Declaration. All urban land proposed for development which
lies within 1,000 feet of an Agriculture zoning district boundary shall be
subject to a deed declaration that requires the owners and all successors in
interest to recognize and accept common, customary and accepted farming
practices which may produce noise, dust, odors, and other impacts. The deed
declaration shall be in a form approved by the city. After the deed declaration
is signed it shall be recorded in the official records of Licking County, and
copies shall be mailed to the owners of adjacent agricultural lands zoned
Agriculture.
         F.   Maintenance Program. Land adjacent to an Agriculture zoning
district boundary shall be subject to a restrictive covenant that provides that
the perpetual maintenance of mitigation-related fencing, the perpetual
horticultural care and maintenance of trees, shrubs, and hedges that are used
for mitigation, and the maintenance of other mitigation elements shall be
solely the responsibility of the owners, Homeowners Association (HOA) and/or
all successors in interest of property subject to the covenant. The covenant
shall be in a form approved by the city. After the covenant is signed it will
be recorded in the official records of Licking County.
         G.   Runoff. Measures appropriate to the circumstances present shall
be undertaken by the applicant to mitigate adverse impacts which occur from
periodic naturally occurring runoff and inadvertent agricultural irrigation
runoff.
         H.   Ownership. All buffer mitigation areas shall be contained with
the boundary of a single parcel owned and maintained by the Homeowners
Association.
            (Ord. 20-2018. Passed 6-19-18.)
1184.03  MITIGATION STANDARDS.
   (a)   Illustration of Tree Buffer/Setback Combination Options.
      (1)   Figure 1 illustrates the tree buffer/setback combination options
for applicants.
         A.   The "tree" symbol illustrates the number of rows required under
each option.
         B.   Minimum setbacks are represented by the "structure" symbol ranged
along a linear scale showing distance from the urban/agricultural boundary.
Setbacks apply to any structure or property line as defined.
      (2)   The figure does not depict screening shrubs; however, that element
is required when a tree-based buffer is used and when the tree species in the
first row on the agricultural side will not provide sufficient foliage cover to
ground level.
      (3)   Where there is a mix of urban uses, the buffer design shall protect
the most sensitive use among them.
   (b)   Tree Buffers.
      (1)   Three-Row Buffer. Depending on the species used, the minimum
possible tree buffer width is 100 feet. A 50' setback from buffer/mitigation
area is required to property line for a high sensitivity urban receptor and 50'
to structures for low sensitivity receptors. The buffer area may be extended to
150 feet with no setback required. The buffer shall be composed of at least two
different conifer species.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3163_7200x4830.jpg]
      (2)   Row Spacing and Offset. The purpose of the row-by-row offset is to
mitigate the effect of individual tree mortality and to compensate for the
individual differences between trees.
         A.   Three-Row Buffer.
            i.    Offset. Set off the second row by one third the spacing
distance of trees (ST) in the first row; set off the third row by another
third. Refer to Figure 2 for clarification.
            ii.    Spacing of Rows. The distance between rows will be
determined using the following formula, where SR is the spacing distance
between rows, D1 is the widest foliage diameter of the tree species in one row
when it reaches a height of 30 feet, and D2 is the widest foliage diameter of
the tree species in the next row when it reaches a height of 30 feet:
               SR = 0.5(D1 + D2) + 4
      (3)   Tree Spacing within Rows. Tree spacing within a row is based on the
greatest foliar diameter of a given tree species when it reaches a height of 30
feet. Coniferous trees vary from narrow pyramidal forms (e.g., Atlas cedar) to
broad pyramidal forms (e.g., Norway spruce), so the following table contains
calculation methods for each.
Table 1. Calculation of Tree Spacing within Rows for Narrow- and Broad-Diameter
Trees
 
                   Narrow ST =    Broad ST =
single-species row 1.25D          1.1D
two-species row    0.625(D1 + D2) 0.55(D1 + D2)
               
      D =    Typical foliar diameter of a tree species when 30 feet tall. The
diameter is measured at the widest extent of a pyramidal conifer.
      ST =    Tree spacing within rows; calculated as a multiple of tree
diameter.
Note: When planting more than two species in a row, use the two species with
the widest diameters to calculate spacing.
      (4)   Minimum Tree Height at Planting. Five to six feet, balled and
burlapped.
      (5)   Permitted Tree Species.
         A.   Applicants may use any species of conifer trees provided they are
resistant to or will not harbor agriculturally harmful insects or diseases.
         B.   A list of recommended species is available in Appendix I
   (c)   Transitions between Buffers of Different Intensity. The principal
purpose of the tree buffer is to mitigate spray drift; spray height is the
primary factor in determining whether a higher- or lower-intensity buffer is
required. To lessen the amount of spray being carried past a transition between
the two types of buffer, the applicant will extend the buffer 75 feet beyond
the end of the higher-intensity buffer, as shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Buffer Overlapping for Transition Areas

IMAGES/0-0-0-3166_7200x4290.jpg]
   (d)   Screening Shrubs.
      (1)   Screening shrubs are used only in conjunction with tree buffers.
      (2)   If the first row of trees on the agricultural side of the tree
buffer does not have foliage down to ground level, install screening shrubs to
provide sufficient foliage cover to close the gap. If the first row of trees on
the agricultural side of the buffer provides foliage down to ground level, then
screening shrubs are not required.
      (3)   The mature height of the shrubs shall be 125 percent of the
anticipated ground-to-foliage bare space of the average mature specimen of tree
species.
      (4)   Permitted Screening Shrubs.
         A.   Applicants may use any species of screening shrubs provided they
are resistant to or will not harbor agriculturally harmful insects or diseases.
         B.   A list of recommended species is available in the regional plan,
Appendix III, available at the Village of Johnstown zoning departments.
   (e)   Trespass-Inhibiting Hedges and Fences.
      (1)   Hedges and fences may be used separately or in combination to
inhibit trespass onto agricultural land.
      (2)   Hedge Standards. 
         A.   Spacing and Number of Rows. One or more rows, whichever is
sufficient to create an eight-foot- wide buffer at maturity.
         B.   Spacing within Rows. As appropriate to eliminate gaps within
three years of planting.
         C.   Overall Height.
            i.    No less than three (3) gallon if being used solely as a
trespass inhibitor.
            ii.    If doubling as screening shrubbery, the hedge needs to cover
any bare space between the ground and the lowest branches of trees in the
central portion. Mature height shall be 125 percent of anticipated ground-to-
foliage bare space of average mature specimen of tree species being screened.
         D.   Permitted Trespass-Inhibiting Species. Applicants may use any
species of trespass-inhibiting hedges provided they are resistant to or will
not harbor agriculturally harmful insects or diseases. A list of recommended
species is available in the regional plan, Appendix I, available at the Village
of Johnstown zoning departments.
      (3)   Fence Standards.
         A.   Minimum fence height: six feet.
         B.   Fences shall be climb resistant.
         C.   Install gates only when necessary for maintenance of the
mitigation area.
   (f)   Other Design Requirements.
      (1)   Road Placement. It is always preferable to not bisect buffers with
roads due to the wind-funneling effect they create. If a road is unavoidable,
it should be as narrow as possible, not straight, and should not be oriented to
the prevailing wind. It should be noted that even a road with an acceptable
orientation and design will permit some degree of increased spray drift to pass
through the buffer area, and will also pose a greater risk of trespass
         (Ord. 20-2018. Passed 6-19-18.)
1184.04  DEVIATIONS.
   (a)   Deviations from Provisions.
      (1)   A proposed mitigation design that deviates from the provisions may
be approved by the Planning & Zoning Commission as described in this section.
      (2)   A mitigation design may not be considered as a deviation if
existing elements consistent with the purpose of the buffer are incorporated,
as described below:
         A.   For mitigation without tree buffers the requirements of linear
distance can be achieved by elements such as the following:
            i.    Manmade or natural features such as infrastructure rights-of-
way, roads, watercourses, wetlands, rock outcrops, forested areas, and steep
slopes;
            ii.    Nonfarmable areas of the agricultural land being buffered
(including yards, storage areas, roads, and all structures) unless such land is
used for animal husbandry.
            iii.    Publicly owned land without consistent present or projected
public use (as determined by the public entity owner);
            iv.    An easement on agricultural land purchased by the applicant;
            v.    Other open areas (except undeveloped rural residential,
commercial, or industrial parcels) that are considered appropriate to the
purpose of the buffer.
         B.   For mitigation with tree buffers the approving authority may
allow the requirements to be partially or fully satisfied by existing areas of
trees and shrubs, as long as their mitigation effect is essentially the same as
that intended by the requirements in Section
1184.03. If the characteristics of the existing vegetation do not meet the
requirements in Section
1184.03, and cannot substitute in full or in part for an adequate tree buffer,
then the area can either be incorporated into the design at half its mitigation
value (for example, a 20-foot-wide riparian area would be calculated as 10 feet
of tree buffer) or it can be left out of the tree buffer and be calculated at
its original width (20 feet of existing vegetation would be considered as 20
feet of bare land).
      (3)   When an applicant proposes a mitigation design that deviates from
the minimum standards in this section, the applicant is responsible for the
preparation of a conflict assessment and mitigation study (CAMS).
      (4)   Conflict Assessment and Mitigation Study (CAMS).
         A.   The CAMS shall:
            i.    Determine the present and likely future agricultural land
uses, practices, and activities with the potential to cause adverse impacts to
adjacent urban development. This determination shall be based on factors such
as soil type; topography; parcel size, shape, and location; infrastructure;
microclimatic conditions; regional agricultural practices and crops; and the
farming history of the adjacent agricultural land and surrounding similar
parcels.
            ii.    Determine how the proposed urban development would likely
impact the management and operation of nearby agricultural lands. All owners of
Agriculture-zoned land within 1,000 feet of the land proposed for development
shall be asked for an interview, and the findings of those interviews will be
included in the CAMS.
            iii.    Identify the land uses, practices, and activities that may
cause adverse impacts and the extent of the impacts, from both the urban use as
well as from the agricultural land. It shall also quantify the impacts, where
possible, in terms of frequency and duration of activities to determine the
impacts. As part of this evaluation, the CAMS shall consider the likely future
uses determined in subsection (a)(4)A.(i) of this section. The buffering
mechanisms that are proposed shall be sufficient to accommodate these potential
future uses. The current financial viability of a particular crop will not be
considered an important limiting factor in determining potential future use.
            iv.    Propose a set of buffering measures that will achieve
acceptable buffering outcomes, which may include, but are not limited to, the
siting of residences, size and geometry of lots, separation distances, communal
open space, vegetation, natural landscape features, acoustic features, and so
forth.
            v.    Propose the means by which the proposed buffering measures
will be monitored and maintained. This includes responsibility for implementing
and maintaining specific features of the buffer areas to ensure continued
effectiveness. Acknowledgment of the authority responsible for ensuring
compliance with any agreement will be plainly cited.
            vi.    Establish a timeline for the development that establishes
when the buffer will be installed.
      (5)   Any approval of a deviation does not create a precedent for any
subsequent requests for deviations from the standards of this section.

inspection as is deemed necessary to determine that such fence is constructed
in accordance with plans submitted for permit, provided however, that the
issuance of such permit by the Village shall not be construed to mean the
Village has determined such fence is not encroaching upon another lot, nor

APPROPRIATENESS.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed environmental change,
including landscaping or exterior signage, the Board or City staff member shall
consider the following, as a part of its review:
   (a)   The compliance of the application with the Design Guidelines and
Requirements. The proposed environmental change is to comply with the Design
Guidelines and Requirements of the City, incorporated by reference.
   (b)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (c)   The visual and functional components of the building and its site,
including but not limited to landscape design and plant materials, lighting,
vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and signage.
   (d)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
   (e)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its historic
time, place and use. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek
to create an appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original integrity
of the property shall be discouraged.
   (f)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (g)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
   (h)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of
the property and its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (k)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved, if such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (l)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
   (m)   Demolition of a structure shall follow the criteria for evaluation and

1187.08 as it relates to consideration of the demolition of a structure.
      (Ord. 16-2024. Passed 7-15-24.)
1187.09  DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Decisions approving or denying Certificates of Appropriateness for the
demolition of structures will be guided by the following criteria, among other
considerations.
   •    The historic, architectural, or cultural significance of the structure.
   •    How the structure contributes to the identity of the district.
   •    The feasibility of reproducing the structure due to characteristics
unique to the building, including design, materials, architectural details,
etc.
   •    Whether the structure represents a specific example of period
construction or is the one of the last remaining buildings from this period.
   •    Plans for the reuse of the property and how these plans affect the
character and identity of the surrounding district.
   •    Whether the structure presents a clear danger to the health and safety
of the public. This may include the possibility of unexpected collapse,
existence and dissemination of pollutants, unauthorized use, etc.
   •    Whether there is clear evidence that alternatives to demolition have
been explored.
   •    Whether there is benefit to the public to protect or demolish the
structure based on the current or projected use of the property.
   •    Whether the structure has been altered to the extent that no historic
or architectural relevance is
   •    Is there a reuse plan? A new structure would need to have conformity
with the surrounding architecture.
   •    Is it legitimately in poor enough structural condition as to warrant
demolition and not "demolition by neglect"
   •    Does the demolition negatively affect adjacent property owners?
   •    The lot must be returned to turf and landscape, and anything posing a
danger must be filled/remediated like basements/foundations/septic tanks/
cisterns etc. The Design Review Board can also decide if they want to ensure
that foundation slabs, driveways, walkways, fences, etc. are removed.
   (b)   Purposeful Neglect.  The Design Review Board will not approve
applications where the willful neglect of a property is evident. In cases of
intentional neglect, or damage, where the property has been allowed to
deteriorate with the purpose of causing demolition, the owner may be held
responsible for the cost to stabilize, repair, or replace the structure.
(Ord. 16-2024. Passed 7-15-24.)
1187.10 MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance
or repair of any property within the Design Review District, nor shall anything
in this Chapter be construed to prevent any change, including the construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any feature which in the view of
the Village Manager is required for the public safety because of an unsafe,
insecure or dangerous condition.
(Ord. 16-2010. Passed 8-17-10.)
1187.11 MODIFICATIONS.
   Certificates of Appropriateness or Design Plans which have been previously
approved by the Design Review Board and require minor modifications may be made
with the approval of the Chair of the Design Review Board and the City Planner.
To apply, the applicant shall submit to the City Planner four (4) sets of the
previously approved plans and the proposed minor modification, along with a
written statement explaining the reason for the proposed minor modification.
Within ten (10) working days after the plan submission, the City Planner and
the Chair of the Design Review Board shall review and approve or disapprove the
minor modification. Input from the City Engineer can be requested by the City
Planner and the Chair of the Design Review Board. Approval shall be granted
only if the City Planner and the Chair of the Design Review Board unanimously
agree the minor modification does not significantly change the previously
approved plan. If unanimous consent is not obtained, the proposed minor
modifications are disapproved and can only be made if approved by the Design
Review Board.

1197.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible and
economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level of
storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to property
and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of Johnstown, Ohio:
   (a)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within Johnstown, Ohio to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize Johnstown, Ohio's future
expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1197.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Licking County, and
Johnstown, Ohio shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after the date upon which this Chapter becomes effective and, to the
maximum extent practicable, for projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1193 Erosion and Sediment Control. (Ord. 13-2019. Passed 4-2-19.)

1197.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm
event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to
meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The storm water management practices shall function as an integrated system
that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving storm water
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         Storm water management practices that meet the criteria in this
regulation, and additional criteria required by the Village Engineer shall
comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)   Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1111, Design Standards, shall provide storm water management for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)   Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section
1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1197.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the Village Engineer as detailed in Section
1197.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by Johnstown, Ohio, storm
water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a
separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if
compensated by the property owners, by Johnstown, Ohio. Storm water management
practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots, protected within
an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
   (b)   Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream relocation or enclosure: The Village Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site storm water discharges: Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other storm water management practice from areas too long and/or too large to
maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour
storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Johnstown, Ohio zoning or where the use of an open drainage
system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the Village
Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer systems
when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm.
            The system shall be designed to meet these requirements when
conveying the flows from the contributory area within the proposed development
and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream from the development.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Full headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or
outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in Johnstown, Ohio:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Full headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or storm water management practice such that the
runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing path and
does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year
water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot
below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing the flood
routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be
taken into consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by Johnstown, Ohio must be
compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. For all areas of
development that do not increase the floodplain storage by 1/10th of the
floodplain elevation there shall be no compensatory flood storage requirement.
First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes
should be given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to
the new floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration
will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to
compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the
contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by Johnstown, Ohio,
reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal
boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage
areas must reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed
area. The use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Storm Water Quality Control:  
      (1)   All stormwater quality control shall be in accordance with the Ohio
EPA General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activity Under the NPDES.
   (d)   Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects: Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing site
impervious areas by at least 20 percent. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, then stormwater management practices shall be
implemented to provide storm water quality control facilities for at least 20
percent of the site's impervious area. When a combination of impervious area
reduction and storm water quality control facilities is used, the combined area
shall equal or exceed 20 percent of the site. Where conditions prevent
impervious area reduction or on-site stormwater management for redevelopment
projects, practical alternatives as detailed in Section
1197.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 13-2019. Passed 4-2-19.)
 
1197.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When Johnstown, Ohio determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of storm water quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of storm water quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the drainage area of the proposed development
project to the maximum extent practicable.
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer and/or the
Village Manager:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by Johnstown, Ohio to be applied to
community-wide storm water management practices.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices and/or
the retrofit of an existing practice to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to storm water control such as wetland complexes.
(Ord. 13-2019. Passed 4-2-19.)
            
1197.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to storm water management practices as required by the Village
Engineer and/or Village Manager for inspections and maintenance shall be
secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply to all easements:

1199.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-Structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
        Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from Johnstown, Ohio Engineer, is
required for any one of the following conditions, as determined in Table 3
below:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.   10-acres of disturbed drainage.
         The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone
and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67
cubic yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area and have a
minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a drainage area over
5 acres.
         The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of
the following methods:
         A.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000 feet, three
(3) per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model. When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-
site areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The
configuration between the inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at
least two units of length for each one unit of width (>2:1 length: width
ratio), however a length to width ration of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must
be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity has been
reduced by 40 percent. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies
one-half of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the
applicant must consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as
a design factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must
be used where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a
combination of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve
maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 >2% but < 20%
0.125                                >20% but < 50%
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
            Based on site conditions, Johnstown, Ohio Engineer may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.
            These additional BMPs may include:
            1.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
            2.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas
must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or
to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1199.09(g) of this regulation.
            3.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. Johnstown, Ohio Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions
shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage
area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all containers in
the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternately, sediment may
be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter bag or
comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain sediment or
other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. However,
care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it does not
become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other pollutant
sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24-hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from Johnstown, Ohio Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
   stabilization is achieved.
      (3)   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
         These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by Johnstown, Ohio or an alternate
form acceptable to Johnstown, Ohio Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
            1.   The inspection date.
            2.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.

               c.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years, following final
stabilization, the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications
of personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major
observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to
whether the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any
incidents of non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by Johnstown, Ohio Engineer.
      When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation
of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be
followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
      (4)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by
Johnstown, Ohio Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.

1301.99    Penalty.
1301.01 SCOPE.
   (a)   Recognizing that the preservation of existing rental housing stock is
of tremendous importance. Rental housing provides needed, affordable housing
for many and is a valuable asset that must be preserved and maintained. The
Village has a significant interest in ensuring that rental housing remains a
desirable housing option for its citizens. Over time rental housing often
deteriorates because of intentional and unintentional neglect by property
owners, managers and tenants. This deterioration often results in substandard
conditions that adversely affect the economic values of neighboring structures,
and that are hazardous to the public health and safety. In many cases, property
owners choose not to make the necessary repairs because of cost, and tenants do
not report the deficiencies out of lack of knowledge or because they fear being
evicted for doing so. A robust rental housing inspection program will be self
sufficient with funds generated by income being used for personnel costs.
   (b)   The Village of Johnstown recognizes a need to compel the disclosure of
information about any residential rental units in the Village and the need for
a registration program.
   (c)   Village Council finds that establishing a rental registration program
is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public; and
prevent deterioration and blight conditions that adversely impact the quality
of life in the Village.
(Ord. 18-2018. Passed 6-5-18.)
1301.02 REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.
   No person shall hereafter allow to be occupied or lease to another person

applicable.
   (b)    Name, address and phone number of a designated local property manager
or contact agent if the property owner lives or has its principal place of
business outside the metropolitan area of the Village, which shall be defined
as a 20 mile radius from the municipal corporation limits.
   (c)    The street address and Licking County Auditor Parcel Number of the
rental property.
   (d)    The number of units within the rental property.
   (e)    The maximum number of occupants permitted in each dwelling unit.
   (f)    The name, address and phone number of the person authorized to make
or order repairs or services for the property, if in violation of Village or
state codes, if that person is different from the owner or local manager or
contact agent.

1301.03  MANNER OF REGISTERING.

(Ord. 18-2018. Passed 6-5-18.)
1301.04 TRANSFER OF PROPERTY.
   Every new owner of residential rental property (whether as fee owner or land
installment contract vendor) shall be required to furnish to the Office of the
Village Manager the information required in Section 1 before taking possession
of the property. Except for the interim registration fee, no registration fee
shall be required of the new owner during the year in which possession takes
place, provided that the previous owner has paid all registration fees and has
complied with all requirements of this ordinance and any notices from any
applicable governmental agency concerning violations of health, zoning, fire or

misdemeanor. The Village may pursue the civil penalty and the minor misdemeanor
simultaneously, where appropriate, in the sole discretion of the Law Director.

      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
      H.   Zone X (Future Base Flood): Also known as area of future conditions
flood hazard, the land area that would be inundated by the one percent annual
chance flood based on future conditions hydrology.
   (12)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS) means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway
boundaries, and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
   (13)   Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   (14)   Historic structure means any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (15)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (16)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) is a revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) is a revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is a formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (17)   Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (18)   Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (19)   Manufactured home park means as specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (20)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is a Federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (21)   New construction means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Johnstown’s Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 17, 1982, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (22)   Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (23)   Special Flood Hazard Area means the land in the floodplain subject to
a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps
and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special
flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated
from other federal state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (24)   Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (25)   Structure means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (26)   Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (27)   Substantial Improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (28)   Variance means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (29)   Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Johnstown as identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas
annexed by the Village of Johnstown.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.05 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
“Flood Insurance Study Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas” dated May
2, 2007. This study, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated May 2,
2007 and any revisions thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to
be a part of this ordinance. The Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate
Maps are on file at the offices of the Village of Johnstown.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.06 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full compliance with
the terms of this ordinance and all other applicable regulations which apply to
uses within the jurisdiction of this ordinance, unless specifically exempted
from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1331.11.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal any existing ordinances including
subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall
be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant
or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by
the regulations.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,

a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Johnstown, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   (a)   An application for a floodplain development permit shall be required
for all development activities located wholly within, partially within, or in
contact with an identified area of special flood hazard. Where it is unclear
whether a development site is in an area of special flood hazard, the
Floodplain Administrator may require an application for a floodplain
development permit to determine the development’s location.
   (b)   A floodplain development permit shall be obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator before construction or development begins within any area of
special flood hazard established in Section
1331.05. Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished
by the Floodplain Administrator and may include but not be limited to: site
specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. The following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed non-
residential structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1331.16 where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1331.16 where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
         (Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.11 EXEMPTION FROM FILING A DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   An application for a Development Permit shall not be required for
maintenance work such as roofing, painting and basement sealing or for small
nonstructural development activities (except for filling and grading) valued at
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Any proposed action exempt from filing
for a Development Permit is also exempt from the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.12 DESIGNATION OF THE FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Manager or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and
implement these regulations and is referred to herein as the Floodplain
Administrator.
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.13 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR.
   The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall
include but are not limited to:
   (a)   Permit Review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this ordinance have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may
also be delineated in other sources of flood information. If the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway, assure that the
encroachment provision of Section
1331.17(a) is met.
   (b)   Use of Other Base Flood Elevation and Floodway Data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1331.05, are designated as Zone A on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map.
Within these areas, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from
federal, state or other source, including data obtained under
1331.16(f), in order to administer Sections
1331.16(a), (b) and
1331.17.
   (c)   Information to be Obtained and Maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         A.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
         B.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications.
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this ordinance.
   (d)   Alteration of Watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in Section
1331.10 that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portions
of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for all altered
or relocated portions of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (e)   Interpretation of Flood Boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section
1331.14.
   (f)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.
   (g)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Village of Johnstown’s flood maps and studies identified in Section
1331.05 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1331.16 (f).
      (2)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data
prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or
Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees
for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
         A.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
         B.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations but
no floodway.
      (4)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to
1331.13(g)(1).
(Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.14 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Appeals.
      (1)   The Village Council as established by the Village of Johnstown
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
      (2)   The Village Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made
by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Village Council or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Licking County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Village Council shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and;
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors in subsection (a)(4) above and
the purposes of this ordinance, the Village Council may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
      (6)   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
   (b)   Conditions for Variances.  
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (a)(4) have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not prelude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (5)   Variances shall on be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this ordinance,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (a)(4) hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)

structures must meet the encroachment provisions
1331.17(a) and the following additional standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They all be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall

         (Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.17 FLOODWAYS.
   (a)   Areas with Floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in Section
1331.05 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1331.13(b). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and cause erosion. The
following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (a)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1331.15 et. seq.
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Floodplain Administrator to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (b)   Areas Without Floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard where
FEMA has provided base flood elevation data as set forth in Section
1331.05, but FEMA has not delineated a floodway, the following provisions
apply:
      (1)   New construction, substantial improvements or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 1 (one) foot at any point.
      (2)   If subsection (b)(1) is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1331.15 et. seq.
         (Ord. 01-07. Passed 4-3-07.)
1331.18 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.

1333.01 UNCLEAN PREMISES PROHIBITED.
   No person shall lease, let, permit the continuation of the occupancy of, or
continue the occupancy of any structure or building or any portion thereof,
used for human habitation, unless such structure or building or portion thereof
is free from unclean unsanitary conditions, as defined in Section
1333.02 and unless the provisions of this chapter are complied with.
1333.02 UNSANITARY CONDITIONS; NUISANCE.
   (a)    Any structure or building, or any portion thereof, used for human
habitation shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition when:
      (1)    Any portion of such building or structure is infected with a
communicable disease, or has no toilet facilities as required by law or
ordinance, or by reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or thereon.
      (2)    It is unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or
harmful to the lives or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited
portion of the house being damp or wet or in such a state of disrepair, or has
accumulations of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous
substances or by reason of such defects makes improper use of the drainage,
plumbing or ventilation, or due to the existence on the premises of a nuisance
or other similar condition which is likely to cause sickness among the
occupants.
   (b)    Any structure or building or any portion thereof, used for human
habitation, which is in such unclean or unsanitary condition is hereby declared
to constitute a public nuisance.
   (c)    All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe or not
provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard or are
otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing uses
constitute a hazard to health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation
or obsolescence are "unsafe buildings". All such unsafe buildings are declared
to be a public nuisance and shall be abated by repair and rehabilitation or by
demolition.
1333.03 ABATEMENT ORDER; VACATION.
   (a)    Whenever Council ascertains from examination or reports from its
inspectors or sanitary officers or otherwise, that a public nuisance exists as
defined in Section
1333.02, in or upon any structure or building or portion thereof, and is of the
opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate
vacation of the premises or such portion thereof, and serves notice upon the
owner of such house, or his lessee or agent, or the person in possession,
charge or control thereof directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the
unclean or unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by
the authority and specified in the notice, the owner, agent or person shall
abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever abatement does not take place
within the prescribed time, or whenever in the opinion of Council such
abatement is impossible or impractical without an immediate vacation of the
house or portion thereof, and notice is served upon the owner, lessee, agent,
or person in possession, charge or control thereof to vacate or cause the
vacation of such house or portion thereof designated in the notice, such
vacation shall occur within the time specified in the notice and if no time is
specified, then not less than twenty-four hours after service of notice.
Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of notices as provided
herein, Council is of the opinion that such nuisance can be abated by a tenant
or other occupant of such building or structure or portion thereof, and such
notices, either for abatement of the nuisance or of vacation of the premises,
are served upon the tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the duty of such
tenant or other occupant to comply with the terms of such notices and to abate
the nuisance or vacate the premises accordingly. After service of such notice
or order of vacation, no person shall occupy or permit the occupancy of such
premises or portion thereof until the nuisance has been completely abated and
such building or portion thereof has been rendered clean and sanitary in
accordance with the terms of the notices as provided herein.
   (b)   When there is no owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession
or control who is a resident of or can be served within the Village, then
personal service outside of the Village on any such owner, agent, lessee or
person in charge, possession or control by anyone delegated by Council shall be
made by registered letter. If the address of the owner, lessee, agent or person
in possession, charge or control is unknown, or service is not secured by
registered letter after an effort to do so, notice shall be made by publication
once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of general circulation
in the Village or by posting or attaching to or on the outside of the structure
or building, a copy of the notice or order consecutively for two weeks.
   (c)    The Zoning Inspector and Fire Inspector shall examine or cause to be
examined every building or structure, or portion thereof, reported as or
believed to be an unsafe building. He shall give written notice to the owner or
owners of record, including any purchasers under a recorded land contract, and
to the persons occupying the building if they are not the owners thereof. The
written notice shall specifically state the defects that cause the building or
structure to be unsafe and shall state that the work shall commence within
thirty days and continue work, either to complete the specified repairs or
improvements, or to demolish and remove the building or structure or portion
thereof, leaving the premises in a clean, safe and sanitary condition, such
condition being subject to the approval of the Zoning Inspector and Fire
Inspector. In cases of emergency making immediate repairs necessary, the Zoning
Inspector and Fire Inspector may order the change or demolition to be made
within a shorter period. The notice shall also require the building or portion
thereof to be vacated forthwith by the occupants thereof.
   Proper service of such notice shall be by personal service, registered or
certified mail; provided, however, that such notice shall be deemed to be
properly served if a copy thereof is sent to the last known address. If any of
the parties cannot be located, or proper addresses cannot be ascertained, this
notice shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy thereof is placed in a
conspicuous place in or about the building or structure affected by the notice.
1333.04 VACATION AND ABATEMENT HEARINGS.
   (a)    When the notice or order of vacation follows a notice or order of
abatement, as provided in Section
1333.03, enforcement of such notice or order of vacation shall not be carried
out as provided in this chapter unless the notice or order of abatement
specifies a time when the person so notified or ordered may appear for a
hearing before Council or other appropriate authority to show cause why such
order or notice of vacation should not be issued. The hearing shall be set not
less than five days after service of the notice or order of abatement.
   (b)    When the notice or order of vacation is issued as provided in Section
1333.03 without a previous notice or order of abatement, the enforcement of
such notice or order of vacation shall not be carried out as provided in this
chapter unless it specifies a time, not less than five days after service of
the notice, when the person so notified or ordered may appear for a hearing
before Council to show cause why such notice or order should not be enforced.
In the event of an emergency which requires, for the protection of the health
of occupants, the vacation of the building or portion thereof without delay,
then no such fixing of a time for a hearing as provided herein shall be
required.
1333.05  NOTICE OF VACATION; POSTING.
   (a)    Whenever, in the opinion of Council, such procedure is desirable or
necessary, Council may affix conspicuously on the buildings of part thereof the
notice or order of vacation.
   (b)    The Zoning Inspector and Fire Inspector shall cause to be posted at
each entrance to any building deemed unsafe, a notice to read: DO NOT ENTER.
UNSAFE TO OCCUPY. VILLAGE OF JOHNSTOWN OHIO.
   Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs are made or
demolition is completed. No person shall remove such notice without permission
of the Zoning Inspector.
1333.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Enforcement by Police Chief. When the notice or order of vacation as
provided in this chapter has not been complied with, and Council certifies such
fact to the Police Chief, together with a copy of the order of notice, the
Police Chief shall enforce such notice or order of vacation and cause the
premises to be vacated in accordance with the terms of such notice or order.
   (b)    Enforcement through Court Proceedings. Whenever Council certifies to
the Director of Law any failure to comply with any order or notice of abatement
or vacation, with the request that civil proceedings for enforcement thereof be
instituted, the Director of Law shall institute any and all proceedings, either
legal or equitable, that may be appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of
such order or notice. All suits or proceedings are to be brought in the name of
the Village and proceedings under this section shall not relieve any party
defendant from criminal prosecution or punishment under this chapter.
1333.07 HOTELS AND LODGING HOUSES.
   Every owner of, and every agent in charge of a tenement house, lodging
house, tourist home, tourist cabin or hotel, or part thereof, shall cause all
parts of the premises not within the occupied apartments to be kept clean. No
person shall place filth, urine, or fecal matter in any place other than that
provided for the same, or keep filth, urine or fecal matter in his apartments
or upon his premises for such length of time as to create a nuisance, and every
tenant shall keep his apartment in clean and sanitary condition. The walls of
courts and shafts, unless built in a light colored brick or stone, shall be
thoroughly whitewashed or painted a light color and shall be so maintained. The
whitewash or paint shall be renewed as required by health authorities.
1333.08  RIGHT TO DEMOLISH; COSTS.
   In case the owner of record, or the purchaser under a land contract, if that
is the case, fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair,
rehabilitate or demolish and remove a building or structure or portion thereof,
the Fire Inspector shall proceed to have the building or structure or portion
thereof demolished and removed from the premises, leaving the premises in a
clean, safe and sanitary condition, and the cost of such work shall be paid by
the Village. If the Village is not immediately reimbursed for such cost, the
amount thereof shall be certified to the County Auditor who shall place the
costs upon the tax duplicate. The costs are a lien against the property and
shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the Village.
1333.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty of a minor
misdemeanor and fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day a
violation continues or occurs shall constitute a separate offense.

in this chapter.
   (b)   The owner, agent, lessee, occupant or other person having control of
any building in the Village upon a street to which street numbers of buildings
have been assigned shall cause the proper Arabic numbers to be placed on and
continuously maintained on the fanlight, transom, door, entrance, steps or
gate, or other conspicuous place on the front of such building in such a manner
that the number may at all times be legible and visible from the street
pavement in front of such building. If a building stands back more than forty-
five feet from the front lot line, the number shall be conspicuously displayed
at or near the walk, driveway, or common entrance to such building at the
street line on a gate post, fence, tree, or post, or other appropriate place so
as to be legible and visible from the street pavement. As used in this section,
"front" means that side of the building which faces the street on which the
