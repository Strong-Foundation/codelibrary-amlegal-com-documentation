EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
(1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action taken
thereunder;
(2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or liability
previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
(3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
(4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any such
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
(c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
(2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings of
Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

(3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
(4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
(1)   The object sought to be attained;
(2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
(3)   The legislative history;
(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be

   127.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   The proper operation of democratic government requires that all public
officials, elected or appointed, and employees be independent, impartial and
responsible to the people; that government decisions and policy be made in
proper channels of governmental structure; that public office not be used for
personal gain; and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its
government. In recognition of these goals there is hereby established this Code
of Ethics for all public officials and employees, whether elected or appointed,
paid or unpaid. Accordingly, this Code shall apply to, and regulate the conduct
of, including all members of Council, the Mayor, all officers and employees of
the Village, and all members of any board, commission or advisory committee or
council of the Village of Bratenahl ("Village"), to all of whom the phrase
"officials and employees," as used in this Code, shall be deemed to apply. The
purpose of this Code is to establish and set forth Villagers' expectations for
ethical standards of conduct for all such officials and employees by setting
forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of
the Village. The provisions and purpose of this Code and such rules and
regulations as may be established are hereby declared to be in the best
interest of the Village. (Ord. 3598. Passed 9-18-13.)
   127.02 RESPONSIBILITIES OF PUBLIC OFFICE.
   The public officials and public employees of the Village are agents of
public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public only. They are
bound to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, the
Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio, and the laws of the Village; and to
carry out impartially the laws of the United States, the State of Ohio, and the
Village and thus foster respect for government. They are bound to observe in
their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge
faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations,
recognizing that the public interest shall be their primary concern. Their
conduct in their official matters and business should be above reproach.
(Ord. 3598. Passed 9-18-13.)
   127.03 DEDICATED SERVICE.
   (a)   All public officials and public employees of the Village should be
fully aware of the objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs
developed to attain and maintain those objectives. Appointive officials and
employees shall adhere to the rules of work and performance established for
their positions by the appropriate authority.
   (b)   Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach
the law, or ask others to do so, and they should strive to work in full
cooperation with other public officials and employees and the general public
unless prohibited from so doing by law or by the officially recognized
confidentiality of their work.
(Ord. 3598. Passed 9-18-13.)
   127.04 FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT.
   No official or employee of the Village shall request, use or permit the use
of Village- owned leased or controlled vehicles, equipment, materials or
property for personal convenience or profit, except when such equipment
services are available to the public generally or are provided as Village
policy adopted pursuant to ordinance for the use of such official or employee
in the conduct of official business. Every official or employee of the Village
shall strive to give equal consideration, treatment, and advantage to any
person.
(Ord. 3598. Passed 9-18-13.)
   127.05 CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   No member of Council, the Mayor or other public official or public employee
of the Village, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or
transaction or have a financial or personal interest, direct or indirect, which
is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties in the
public interest or which would tend to impair his or her independence of
judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties, without
first making a public disclosure thereof. Personal interest, as distinguished
from financial interest, includes an interest arising from blood, adoption,
guardianship or marriage or close business or political association.
   Typical conflicts of interest are enumerated herein for the guidance of all
public officials and public employees and Villagers:
   (a)   Incompatible Employment: Holding, engaging in or accepting private
employment or rendering services for or on behalf of private interests where
such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of the

the performance of the official duties of the public official or public
employee.
   (b)   Disclosure of Confidential Information: Disclose, without appropriate
authorization, any information acquired by the public official or public
employee in the course of his or her official duties which is confidential
because of statutory or ordinance provisions, or when clearly designated as
confidential to him or her when such confidential designation is warranted
because of the status of the proceedings or the circumstances under which the
information was received and preserving its confidentiality is clearly
necessary to the proper conduct of government business. No such information
shall be used to advance the financial or private interest of the public
official or public employee or others.
   (c)   Gifts and Favors: Solicit, receive, accept or agree to receive or
accept, directly or indirectly, or use or authorize the use of the authority or
influence of his or her office or employment to secure anything of value or the
promise or offer of anything of value for or in connection with his or her
public service or public employment including, but not limited to, any gift,
service, loan, gratuity, compensation, favor, thing or promise from any person,
partnership, trust, business trust, corporation or association which to the
knowledge of the public official or public employee is interested, directly or
indirectly, in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the Village or
that may tend to manifest an influence upon the public official or employee in
the proper discharge of public duties; nor shall any public official or
employee grant in the discharge of public duties any improper favor, service or
thing of value. For the purposes of this Section (c) publicly elected and
appointed officials may accept de minimis hospitality, such as breakfasts or
lunches with constituents, up to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) per
person or entity, not to exceed an annual total of five hundred dollars ($500)
without requiring public disclosure.
For the purposes of this subsection (c) publicly elected and appointed

the Village in any litigation or proceeding in which the Village is a party; or
accept a retainer or other compensation that is contingent upon a specific
action by a Village agency, including Council, administrative department,
division or office, board or commission; or appear before any board, commission
or other public body of the Village except in the performance of public
obligations or official duties.
The provisions of this subsection (d) shall not prohibit:

before any department, division, office, board, commission or other Village
agency in the discharge of his or her duties as such public officer or employee
and without private compensation for such appearance or participation,
including appearance or participation on behalf of constituents as a
representative of the electorate.
      (2)    An appearance at or participation by a public official or
employee, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of partnership, trust,

which he is not a member, with respect to a matter which is not in conflict
with duties as such official or employee of the Village.
   (e)   Contracts with Village: Acting, directly or indirectly, as attorney,
agent broker, or employee or in any other representative capacity on behalf of

property, the cost of which is payable by Village funds or to the Village, or,
directly or indirectly, be interested in the profits of any contract, work or
service with the Village or in the sale or acquisition by the Village of any
property, the cost of which is payable by Village funds or to the Village. No
official or employee of the Village shall, directly or indirectly, have any
interest other than his or her fixed compensation and reimbursable expenses in
any expenditures of funds by the Village. A public official or employee shall
not be deemed interested in any contract, work or service, or the sale or
acquisition by the Village of any property, or the profits of any contract,
work or service, or the sale or acquisition by the Village of any property
unless such is approved, authorized, awarded or entered into by the public
official or public employee in his or her official capacity.
   (f)   Solicitation of Employment: Within one (1) year after termination of
public service or employment, no public official or employee shall represent a
client or act in a representative capacity or accept private employment or
receive private compensation for services, whether as attorney, agent, broker
or employee with respect to any matter, case, proceeding, application,
determination, issue or question in which he or she personally participated

service as such official or employee.
   (g)   Personal Gain: Use of public position for personal gain.
   (h)    Personal Investments: Holding (possession of) investments which
interfere with or tend to interfere with the proper discharge of public duty.

substantial financial interest and when the public official or employee can

corporation or association, trustee of a trust or a shareholder in a
corporation whose shares are not obtainable on a recognized public stock
exchange.
   (k)    Seeking Employment: Soliciting employment with a person, partnership,

position as a reward for any political activity.
Notwithstanding (a) through (I) above, no Member of Council, the Mayor, or
other public official or public employee of the Village is prohibited from
participating in general interest matters that provide a uniform benefit or
detriment to all citizens of the Village and include matters involving taxes,
sewer and water services, police and fire protection, parks; or matters that
are of such character as to not provide a substantial and improper influence on
the employee or official since they do not affect the employee or official in a
selective, differential or disproportionate way from any other citizen. In such
general interest matters, a public employee or official should not be precluded
from participating in such decisions that he or she was duly elected or
appointed to make, unless he or she would secure a particular benefit that
creates a conflict of interest.
Further, notwithstanding (a) through (I) above, this Section
127.05 does not apply to a public contract in which a public official, member
of a public official's family, or one of a public official's business
associates, has an interest, when all of the following apply:

services for the Village or governmental agency or instrumentality involved;
      (2)   The supplies or services are unobtainable elsewhere for the same or

instrumentality as part of a continuing course of dealing established prior to
the public official's becoming associated with the Village or governmental
agency or instrumentality involved;
      (3)   The treatment accorded the Village or governmental agency or
instrumentality is either preferential to or the same as that accorded other
customers or clients in similar transactions;

or decisions of the Village or governmental agency or instrumentality with

         (Ord. 3598. Passed 9-18-13.)
   127.06 DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE INTEREST IN LEGISLATION.

substantial private interest in any such legislation or pending matter, shall
immediately publicly disclose on the official records of the Council the nature
and extent of any direct or financial interest or other personal or private

   129.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   This Code of Conduct reflects and supports trust and public confidence
in government. It ensures that Village of Bratenahl ("Village") officials and
employees share a common basis and understanding for acceptable conduct
extending beyond governing legislative provisions. It recognizes that officials
and employees of the Village are agents of public purpose and hold office for
the benefit and well-being of the public and are bound to observe in their
official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the
duties of their office regardless of personal consideration, recognizing that
the public interest must be their primary concern. It recognizes that officials
and employees have an obligation to serve constituents in a conscientious,
diligent, and responsive manner, acknowledging that as leaders of the
community, they are held to a higher standard of behavior and conduct, while
encouraging independent, impartial and duly responsible service to
constituents. Their conduct in both their official and private affairs should
be above reproach.
   (b)   This Code of Conduct provides guidelines to foster the highest
standards of personal and professional conduct which demonstrate and reflect
upon the integrity of Village officials, employees, and citizens, including
their processes and accomplishments. It is intended to promote trust and public
confidence in government.
(Ord. 3782. Passed 9-17-14.)
   129.02 AVOIDANCE OF IMPRESSION OF CORRUPTIBILITY.
   Public officials and employees of the Village, whether appointed or elected,
full-time or part-time, paid or unpaid, should conduct their official duties
with integrity, impartiality and in the public's interest. They also should
conduct both their official and private matters so as not to reflect a
reasonable basis for the impression that any such official or employee can be
improperly influenced in the performance of his or her official duties. Such an
official or employee should so conduct themselves as to maintain public
confidence in their performance and in the government they represent and to be
worthy of the public trust. They should not be a source of embarrassment to the
Village and should avoid even the appearance of conflict between their public
duties and private interests.(Ord. 3782. Passed 9-17-14.)
   129.03 MAYOR AND VILLAGE COUNCIL INTERACTION.
   (a)   The Mayor and Village Council Members are hereby mandated to act
professionally to preserve and protect the well-being of the Village and its
citizens and to treat each other as they would like to be treated. They are
individuals with a wide variety of backgrounds, personalities, values, opinions
and goals. Despite this diversity, all have chosen to serve in public office
and have the obligation to preserve and protect the well-being of the Village
and its citizens. In all cases, this common goal should be acknowledged and it
should be recognized that certain behaviors are counterproductive.
   (b)   The Mayor and Council Members shall interact with one another in the
following manner:
      (1)   Practice civility and decorum in discussion and debate;
      (2)   Difficult questions, challenges to a particular point of view, and
criticism of ideas and information are legitimate elements of an effective
debate, however, to produce successful resolution of issues, the debate should
not become belligerent, impertinent, slanderous, threatening, abusive,
including personal or disparaging attacks;
      (3)   The Mayor and Council Members have the right to an individual
opinion, each of which should be respected. It should be assumed that each
individual has the appropriate motives and interest of the public in mind and
not criticize differing opinions because they believe them to be lacking in
judgment or improperly motivated;
      (4)   An issue may be contentious without being hostile, degrading, or
defamatory; and
      (5)   The Mayor and Council Members should act as cooperatively as
possible and may be required, from time to time, to modify to some extent their
positions so that a decision can be reached. Compromise in a position does not
indicate dishonestly or lack of integrity, but does indicate a recognition of
the realities involved in reaching a consensus or decision which is in the best
interest of the Village.
         (Ord. 3782. Passed 9-17-14.)
   129.04 PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   Public officials and employees of the Village, whether appointed or
elected, full-time or part-time, paid or unpaid, should make every effort to be
cooperative and show mutual respect for the contributions made by each other
for the best interests of the Village.
 
   (b)   Administrative employees of the Village work within a chain of command
under the direction of the Mayor, as the principal administrator in the
Village. Questions, suggestions, comments, and directions to all administrative
employees should be made through the Mayor.
   (c)   Public criticism of other officials and employees by public officials
and/or employees of the Village is to be avoided since it undermines
effectiveness with the public.
(Ord. 3782. Passed 9-17-14.)
   129.05 CONDUCT AT VILLAGE MEETINGS.
   (a)   Unless otherwise provided by Ohio law and/or the Bratenahl Codified

   (b)   Meetings are to be conducted in a courteous and orderly fashion.
Citizens are encouraged to take advantage of and participate in their
government and to use their right of free speech.
   (c)   Every effort should be made by all participants to be fair and

timely fashion.

one full year from the starting date of employment and for each year of service
thereafter unless such full-time officer or employee’s starting date is on or

   (a)   All full-time employees of the Village shall be entitled for each
completed eighty hours of service to sick leave of four and six-tenths hours
with pay. Employees may use sick leave, upon written approval of the Mayor, or
under such other rules and regulations as he shall promulgate, for absence due

could be communicated to other employees, and for illness, injury or death in
the employee’s immediate family. Unused sick leave shall be cumulative without
limit. Provisional employees or those who render part-time, seasonal,
intermittent, per diem or hourly service shall be entitled to sick leave for
the time actually worked, at the same rate that is granted to full-time
employees.
   (b)   The Mayor may require an employee to furnish a satisfactory written,
signed statement to justify the use of sick leave. If medical attention is

either a written, signed statement or a physician’s certificate shall be
grounds for disciplinary action including dismissal.

retirement from active, full-time service with the Village and with ten or more
years of continuous service with the Village, the State or other political
subdivisions of the State, or any combination thereof, to be paid in cash for
one-half the value of his/her accrued but unused sick leave credit. The payment
shall be based on the employee’s rate of pay at the time of retirement and
eliminates all sick leave credit accrued but unused by the employee at the time
payment is made. An employee may receive one or more payments under this
section, but the aggregate value of accrued but unused sick leave credit that
is paid shall not exceed, for all payments, the value of seven hundred twenty
(720) hours of accrued but unused sick leave.
   (d)   This section only applies at the retirement of full-time Village
employees and shall not be deemed applicable to any removal or involuntary
resignation. As used in this section, “retirement” means disability or service
retirement under any state or municipal retirement system in this state.
   (e)   Bereavement Leave. In addition to the above sick leave, all full-time
employees shall be entitled to up to three continuous days, or twenty-four
hours, of bereavement leave upon the death of a member of the immediate family.
For purposes of this provision of this subsection, "immediate family" shall be
defined as the full-time employees' spouse, child, father, mother, mother-in-
law, father-in-law, brother, sister, grandparents and grandparents-in-law.
   The bereavement leave set forth herein is available irrespective of the
availability of accumulated sick leave, and shall not be used or considered in
calculating available sick leave, sick leave credit or any payments upon
retirement as set forth in subsection (c) above.
(Ord. 3891. Passed 11-16-16.)

   149.07 INJURY LEAVE.
   (a)   When a full-time employee is injured in the line of duty, while
actually working for the Village, he shall be eligible for paid injury leave
not to exceed ninety calendar days which shall not be deducted from any other
accumulated compensated absence time, provided such employee files for Workers
Compensation and executes a waiver assigning to the Village those sums of money
such employee would ordinarily receive as weekly compensation as determined by
law for those number of weeks the employee receives benefits under this
provision.
   (b)   Eligibility for injury leave must be approved by that employee’s
department head and the Mayor within ten days of the processing of such
employee’s Workers Compensation claim through the appropriate Village officer
and such decision shall be reported by the Mayor to Council at Council’s next
regularly scheduled meeting. Eligibility and approval for injury leave shall be
based, in part, upon such employee’s Workers Compensation claim processed
through the appropriate Village office, and, if necessary, also based upon a
physical examination by a physician appointed by the Village resulting in the
physician’s certification that the employee is unable to work due to the
injury. The opinion of the designated physician shall govern whether the
employee is actually disabled or not, but shall not govern whether the injury
was duty related.
   (c)   If at the end of the ninety day period the employee is still disabled,
the injury leave may, at the Mayor’s discretion, be extended for an additional
ninety calendar day period, or any portion thereof. Such decision shall be made
at least ten days prior to the end of such period and such decision shall be
reported by the Mayor to Council at Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting.
   (d)   During injury leave, sick leave shall not be earned and accumulated
nor shall time- off for holidays occurring during leave be granted. Uniform
allowances shall continue to remain in effect during the term of any injury
leave.
(Ord. 2696. Passed 2-17-93.)
   149.08 LEAVE DONATION PROGRAM.
   Employees of the Village of Bratenahl may donate paid sick leave to a fellow
employee who is otherwise eligible to accrue and use sick leave. This section
applies to both full-time and part-time employees of the Village. The intent of
the leave donation program is to allow employees to voluntarily provide
assistance to their co-workers who are in critical need of leave due to serious
illness or injury of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate
family. The definition of immediate family as provided in rule 123:1-47-01 of
the Ohio Administrative Code shall apply for the leave donation program.
   (a)   An employee may receive donated leave, up to the number of hours the
employee is scheduled to work each pay period or as provided in paragraph (a)
(4) of this rule, if the employee who is to receive donated leave:
      (1)   Or a member of the employee's immediate family has a serious
illness or injury;
      (2)   Has no accrued leave;
      (3)   Has not been approved to receive other Village or state-paid
benefits; and
      (4)   Has applied for any paid leave, workers' compensation, or benefits
program for which the employee is eligible. An employee who has applied for
these programs may use donated leave to satisfy the waiting period for such
benefits, when applicable. After the waiting period, donated leave may be used
up to an amount equal to the benefit for which the employee applied, (e.g.,
seventy percent for disability leave benefits) while the employee's application
is pending approval.
   (b)   Employees may donate leave if the donating employee:
      (1)   Voluntarily elects to donate leave and does so with the
understanding that donated leave will not be returned;
      (2)   Donates a minimum of eight hours; and
      (3)   Retains a combined leave balance of at least eighty hours. Leave
shall be donated in the same manner in which it would otherwise be used.
   (c)   The leave donation program shall be administered on a pay period by
pay period basis. Employees using donated leave shall be considered in active
pay status and shall accrue leave and be entitled to any benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Leave accrued by an employee while using donated
leave shall be used, if necessary, in the following pay period before
additional donated leave may be received. Donated leave shall not count toward
the probationary period of an employee who receives donated leave during his or
her probationary period. Donated leave shall be considered sick leave, but
shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
   (d)   Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
      (2)   The type of leave and number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   That the employee will have a minimum combined leave balance of at
least eighty hours; and
      (4)   That the leave is donated voluntarily and the employee understands
that the donated leave will not be returned.
   (e)   Department heads shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate
leave. Department heads shall respect an employee's right to privacy, however
department heads may, with the permission of the employee who is in need of
leave or a member of the employee's immediate family, inform employees of their
co-worker's critical need for leave. Department heads shall not directly
solicit leave donations from employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a
strictly voluntary basis.
      (Ord. 3454. Passed 9-16-09.)
   149.09 EMPLOYEE PROBATIONARY PERIOD.
   (a)   All new or promoted employees are subject to a probationary period as
follows:
         Full time employee - one (1) year from date of appointment.
Part time, seasonal part time, or temporary part time employee - 1040 hours.
   
   During the employee's probationary period, the employee may be terminated
without cause. In the case of promotion, the employee may be placed back into
his former position if the Mayor considers the employee unsuitable for the
intended position.
   (b)   The Street Commissioner, with the approval of the Mayor, may extend
the probationary period for an additional six (6) months for a Service
Department Employee if warranted. During such additional six (6) months, the
employee's rate of pay will remain at the rate established for a probationary
employee.
(Ord. 3774. Passed 7-16-14.)
   149.10 EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT.
   (a)   Full time employees who already have achieved or achieve an

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
161. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 161
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
(a)    Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case for
which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
(b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (l) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. "
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX
   171.0701 METHOD OF DETERMINATION.
   In the taxation of income which is subject to Village income taxes if the
books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within
and without the boundaries of the Village, shall disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part of the
business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the Village, then
only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village
for the purposes of municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net
profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having been derived from within the
Village, in the absence of actual records thereof, shall be determined as
follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
(a)    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the Village
during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in the preceding
paragraph, real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
(b)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period to
persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in the
Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period
to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their services are
performed.
(c)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing allocation formula
does not produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform
regulations, be substituted so as to produce such result.
(Ord. 1835. Passed 6-17-70.)
   171.0702 SALES MADE IN THE VILLAGE .
   As used in subsection (c) of Section
171.0701 "sales made in the Village" means:
(a)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the Village.
(b)    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales results from such solicitation or promotion.
(c)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Village to purchasers outside of the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
(Ord. 1835. Passed 6-17-70.)
   171.0703 TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with subsections (a),
(b), and (c) of Section
171.0701 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving said total in order to obtain the business
allocation percentage referred to in Section
171.0701.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Village.
(Ord. 1835. Passed 6-17-70.)
   171.0704 RENTALS.
   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the computation of
net profits from business activities under subsections (c), (d), and (e) of
Section
171.0501, only if and to the extent that the rental ownership, management or
operation of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00)
per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity, when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00)
per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds said one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) per month; and provided further that the person who operates
a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the
gross income exceeds one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per month.
(Ord. 1835. Passed 6-17-70.)
   171.0705 OPERATING LOSS-CARRY FORWARD.
   (a)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to July 1, 1970, allocable to the Village may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village, until
exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
   (b)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to the
Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to the

in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.

   173.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   173.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
173.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
         (Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.   .
            (Ord. 3881. Passed 9-21-16.)
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
173.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

in Section
173.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)

used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
173.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
173.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
173.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   173.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
173.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
173.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
173.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
173.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   “Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
173.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
 
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
173.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
173.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
173.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
173.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
173.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section 4 of this [Chapter/Ordinance], on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession.
         For taxpayers that make this election, the provisions of division
173.062 of this section apply to such apportionment except as otherwise
provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2)of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D)(1) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (I)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 173.04 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 3825. Passed 10-21-15; Ord. 4206. Passed 12-20-23.)
   173.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
173.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
173.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
173.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
173.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts

         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each

that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;

beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Sction
173.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals

per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
173.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

   173.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   173.081 TAX CREDIT.
   (A)   Effective June 1, 2019, when the taxable income of a resident of the
Village is subject to a municipal income tax in another municipality on the
same income taxable under this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit
of fifty percent (50%) of the income tax paid on such taxable income to such
other municipality, but such credit shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
tax assessed by this chapter. For the purposes of this section, taxable income
shall include the share of net profits of a resident owner of an unincorporated
business entity.
   (B)   A claim for credit or refund under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may by regulation provide. In the event such

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified compensation plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
173.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
173.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

173.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of a
Municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a

shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (B) or (C) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.

corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under

extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section. (Ord. 4206. Passed 12-20-23.)

return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
173.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

Section
173.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
173.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

   173.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
173.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
173.10 of this Chapter.

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
173.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
173.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
173.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
173.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
173.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
173.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)
   173.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
173.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
173.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
173.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
173.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section

(Ord. 3835. Passed 10-21-15.)

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets

   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn

in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:

evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person

enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

   (a)   No person shall operate a watercraft or manipulate any water skis,
aquaplane or similar device in a reckless manner or carelessly or heedlessly,
or at a speed greater or less than is reasonable or proper, having due regard

ANALYSIS.
   (a)   No person shall operate, be in physical control of any vessel
underway, or manipulate any water skis, aquaplane or similar device upon the
waters in this City if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person is under the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse, or
the combined influence of alcohol and a drug of abuse;
      (2)   The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one percent or
more by weight of alcohol in his blood;
      (3)   The person has a concentration of fourteen-hundredths of one gram
or more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his urine;
      (4)   The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one gram or
more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his breath.
 
   (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of this section relating
to operating a vessel or using any water skis, aquaplane or similar device
while under the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse, the court may admit
evidence on the concentration of alcohol or a drug of abuse in the defendant's
blood, urine or breath at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the defendant's blood, urine or breath taken within two
hours of the time of the alleged violation.
   When a person submits to a blood test, only a physician, registered nurse or
qualified technician or chemist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content. This limitation does not
apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A physician, registered nurse
or qualified technician or chemist may refuse to withdraw blood for the purpose
of determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content if in his opinion the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
   The blood, urine or breath shall be analyzed in accordance with methods
approved by the Director of Health of the State by an individual possessing a
valid permit issued by the Director of Health of the State pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143 (3701.14.3).
   If there was at the time the blood, urine or breath was taken a
concentration of less than ten-hundredths of one percent by weight of alcohol
in the defendant's blood, less than fourteen-hundredths of one gram by weight
of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his urine, or less than ten-hundredths of one
gram by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his breath, that fact may be
considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant.
   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the test shall
be made available to him, his attorney or agent, immediately upon the
completion of the test analysis.
   The person tested may have a physician, registered nurse or qualified
technician or chemist of his own choosing administer a chemical test or tests
in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer,
and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test
by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test
or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
   A physician, registered nurse or qualified technician or chemist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first-
aid station or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal liability, and from civil liability that
is based upon a claim of assault and battery or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in
withdrawing blood from the person.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c)(1), (2) or (3) of
this section.

fine of not less than one hundred fifty nor more than one thousand dollars.
         The court may suspend the execution of the mandatory jail term of
three consecutive days that it is required to impose by subsection (c)(1) of
this section if the court, in lieu of the suspended jail term, places the
offender under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and
requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10. The court
also may suspend the execution of any part of the mandatory jail term of three
consecutive days that it is required to impose by subsection (c)(1) of this
section if the court places the offender under a community control sanction
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three consecutive days; requires
the offender to attend, for that part of the three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10; and
sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three
consecutive days that the offender does not spend attending the drivers’
intervention program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs, in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11, of a
municipal ordinance relating to operating a watercraft or manipulating any
water skis, aquaplane, or similar device while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or a combination of them, of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a watercraft or manipulating any water skis, aquaplane or similar
device with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath or urine, of division (A)(1) of Ohio R.C. 2903.06, or
of division (A)(2), (3) or (4) of Ohio R.C. 2903.06 or Ohio R.C. 2903.06 or
2903.07 as they existed prior to March 23, 2000, in a case in which the jury or
judge found that the offender was under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or a combination of them, the court shall sentence the offender to a
jail term of ten consecutive days and may sentence the offender pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.24 to a longer jail term. In addition, the court shall impose
upon the offender a fine of not less than one hundred fifty nor more than one
thousand dollars.
         In addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the offender,
the court may require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program
that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to more than one violation identified in
subsection (c)(2) of this section, the court shall sentence the offender to a
jail term of thirty consecutive days and may sentence the offender to a longer
jail term of not more than one year. In addition, the court shall impose upon
the offender a fine of not less than one hundred fifty nor more than one
thousand dollars.
         In addition to any other sentence that it imposes upon the offender,
the court may require the offender to attend a drivers’ intervention program
that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3793.10.
      (4)   Upon a showing that serving a jail term would seriously affect the
ability of an offender sentenced pursuant to subsection (c)(1), (2) or (3) of
this section to continue the offender’s employment, the court may authorize
that the offender be granted work release after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of three, ten or thirty consecutive days that the court is
required by subsection (c)(1), (2) or (3) of this section to impose. No court
shall authorize work release during the mandatory jail term of three, ten or
thirty consecutive days that the court is required by subsection (c)(1), (2) or
(3) of this section to impose. The duration of the work release shall not
exceed the time necessary each day for the offender to commute to and from the
place of employment and the place in which the jail term is served and the time
actually spent under employment.
      (5)   Notwithstanding any section of the Ohio Revised Code that
authorizes the suspension of the imposition or execution of a sentence or the
placement of an offender in any treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned
or serving a jail term, no court shall suspend the mandatory jail term of ten
or thirty consecutive days required to be imposed by subsection (c)(2) or (3)
of this section or place an offender who is sentenced pursuant to subsection
(c)(2) or (3) of this section in any treatment program in lieu of being
imprisoned or serving a jail term until after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of ten or thirty consecutive days required to be imposed
pursuant to subsection (c)(2) or (3) of this section. Notwithstanding any
section of the Ohio Revised Code that authorizes the suspension of the
imposition or execution of a sentence or the placement of an offender in any
treatment program in lieu of being imprisoned or serving a jail term, no court,
except as specifically authorized by subsection (c)(1) of this section, shall
suspend the mandatory jail term of three consecutive days required to be
imposed by subsection (c)(1) of this section, or place an offender who is
sentenced pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section in any treatment
program in lieu of imprisonment until after the offender has served the
mandatory jail term of three consecutive days required to be imposed pursuant
to subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (6)   As used in subsection (c) of this section, “jail term” and
“mandatory jail term” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct
constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY HELD BY POLICE DEPARTMENT.
   (a)   Any property that has been seized in relation to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 2933.42 and any contraband in the custody of the Police Department that is
subject to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 2933.43 shall be held and disposed of
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2933.43 and any other procedure provided by law. Any

deposited in the fund after payment of the charges set forth in division (D)(1)
through (D)(3) of that section. Monies from the fund shall be allocated by the
Council to the Village Police Department only, and shall only be expended for
any one or more of the following purposes:
(1)   To pay the costs of protracted or complex investigations or prosecutions;
(2)   To provide reasonable technical training or expertise;
(3)   To provide matching funds to obtain Federal grants to aid law
enforcement;
(4)   For such other law enforcement purposes as the Council determines to be
appropriate.
   (c)   Any and all monies that result from the retention, sale or other
disposition of property by the Police Department and that do not qualify for
deposit in the Law Enforcement Trust Fund shall be deposited in the General
Fund.
(Ord. 2555. Passed 9-20-89.)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
   A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
   B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
   C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
   D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
 
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor     Maximum Fine
First degree            $5000.00
Second degree        4000.00
Third degree            3000.00
Fourth degree           2000.00
Minor                   1000.00
Misdemeanor not
specifically classified 2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not
specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.

property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in

545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

have been obtained prior to commencement of the work.

   No person shall cut any curb on any of the streets, alleys or public ways

with a bond guaranteeing that the work shall be done to the full satisfaction
of the Village (represented by the Building Commissioner) and that the area
affected by the work shall be restored, as nearly as possible, to its original
condition and such condition maintained, at the cost of the permit holder, for
a period of one year after the completion of the work. However, such bond may
be released at an earlier period if, in the opinion of the Building
Commissioner, such release is warranted. The amount of such bond shall be
commensurate by the extent of the work and shall be determined by the Building
Commissioner, but in no event shall the amount be less than three hundred
dollars ($300.00) for any one project.
   Applicants who because of their operations find it necessary to enter the
Village streets, alleys or public ways at recurring intervals shall be
permitted to furnish a blanket bond with the same conditions as set forth
herein. The amount of such bond shall be determined by the Building
Commissioner, but in no event shall it be less than one thousand dollars

specific bond subject to the discretion and approval of the Building
Commissioner as to amount and conditions.

   The opening and restoration of a pavement or other surface shall be

   Upon failure or refusal of the permittee to satisfactorily fill the
excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the time
specified in the permit or, where not specified therein, within a reasonable
time after the commencement of the work, the Village may proceed without notice
to make such fill and restoration and the bond referred to in Section
901.05 shall be deemed forfeited. If the amount of such services performed by
the Village shall exceed the amount of the bond, the Village Solicitor and
Clerk shall proceed to collect the remainder due from the permittee.
   901.07 BARRICADES AROUND EXCAVATIONS.
   Any person engaged in or employing others in excavating or opening any
street, sidewalk, alley or other public way shall have such excavation or
opening fully barricaded at all times to prevent injury to persons or animals.

   Any person engaged in or employing others in excavating, or otherwise in any
manner obstructing a portion or all of any street, sidewalk, alley or other
public way, at all times during the night season shall cause at least two
illuminated red lamps to be securely and conspicuously posted on, at or near
each end of such obstruction or excavation, and if the space involved shall
exceed fifty feet in extent, then at least one additional lamp for each added
fifty feet or portion thereof excavated or obstructed shall be so posted.

any street or sidewalk, permit the same to be encumbered with barrels, boxes,
cans, articles, deposits of snow or ice or substances of any kind so as to
interfere with the free and unobstructed use thereof.
(Ord. 2104. Passed 1-18-78.)

failure to possess the financial, technical and managerial resources necessary
to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the Village and in
accordance with Ohio law.
         B.   If the Village denies a person’s application to Occupy or Use the

franchise agreement or ordinance shall require additional consent for such
additional Occupancy or Use. Franchisees shall comply with the Registration

in the removal of its Facilities. Each such insurance policy shall contain the
following endorsement:

the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after receipt by
the Village, by registered mail, of a written notice addressed to the Village
Clerk of such intent to cancel or not to renew.”
      (6)   Within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Village of said notice,
and in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to said cancellation, the

Clerk, a Service Provider may be self-insured to provide all of the same
coverages as listed in this Section; except that all coverages for Workers’
Compensation shall be in compliance with state law. No approval for self-
insurance shall be given until the Village Clerk has made a complete review of
the Service Provider’s financial ability to provide such self- insurance. As a
part of the review process, the Village Clerk may require, and the self-
insurance applicant shall provide, any and all financial documents necessary to
make a valid determination of the applicant’s ability to meet the needs of this
Chapter.
   (f)   General Indemnification. Each application for consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way, and each annual registration, shall include, to the
extent permitted by law, the Service Provider’s express undertaking to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village and its elected and appointed officers,
officials, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors harmless from
and against any and all damages, losses and expenses, including reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs of suit or defense, arising out of, resulting from or
alleged to arise out of or result from the negligent, careless or wrongful
acts, omissions, failures to act or misconduct of the Service Provider or its
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors in the
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation, maintenance, repair or
removal of its System or Facilities, and in providing or offering Services over
the Facilities or System, whether such acts or omissions are authorized,
allowed or prohibited by this Chapter.

(Ord. 3364. Passed 5-16-07.)
   941.05 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Location of Facilities. All Facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within such
Facility.
      (2)   A Service Provider with permission to install Overhead Facilities
shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles
only, and then only if Surplus Space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar Facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a Service
Provider with permission to Occupy the same Public Right-of- Way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities, must also
locate its Facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the Village Clerk.
      (5)   The Village reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)   Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the Village’s goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way.
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and the Village reasonably
determines such construction is in an area in which other Service Providers
would likely construct Facilities in the future, the Village may require the
Service Provider to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with
Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of- Way, provided the Service Provider
shall be reimbursed for the use of the Excess Capacity by another Service
Provider. The Service Provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for
occupancy of the additional conduit space as reimbursement.
   (c)   Village Owned Conduit. If the Village owns or leases conduit in the
path of a Service Provider’s proposed Facilities, and provided it is
technologically feasible for the Service Provider’s Facilities to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the Village, the Service Provider shall be required
to Occupy the conduit owned or leased by the Village I order to reduce the
necessity to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Service Provider shall pay
to the Village a fee for such Occupancy which shall be the cost the Service
Provider would have expended to construct its own conduit, as certified by the
Service Provider’s engineer and approved by the Village Engineer. The Village
and the Service Provider may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments
to the Village.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, a Service Provider shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any Facilities in the Public Right- of-Way whenever the Village shall have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for:
      (1)   The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any Village or other public improvement in or upon the Public
Right-of- Way.
      (2)   The operation of the Village or other government entity in or upon
the Public Right-of-Way.
   Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
Facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
   (e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, any Service Provider or other Person that
owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the Village
or shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the
Village. After thirty (30) days have expired, the Village may remove the
Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way at the other party’s
expense. A System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider’s consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way of the
Village, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and approved by the Village;
      (4)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (5)   If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of- Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the
Village’s consent to Occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction
Permit;
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section
941.03 of this Chapter.
   (f)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities, or stop work on any
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation or Evacuation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public
health, safety or welfare; except to the extent that the Village’s actions
would cause a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.

maintenance and indicating how the Service Provider will meet all requirements
of ODOT’S Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable ODOT
regulations.
   (c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
Emergency work, a Service Provider may commence such Emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for Emergency work that
requires Excavation of a Public Right-of-Way or Lane Obstruction or closing of

possible before commencing such Emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required, the
Service Provider shall notify the Village Clerk.

   1105.01 TITLE.
   This Code is the "Land Planning and Zoning Code and Zone Plan of the Village
of Bratenahl", and is part of the Village Plan.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
   1105.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this Code, and the intent of Council in its adoption, is to
provide planning, standards, criteria, procedures, regulations and control for
the use of land in the Village, and the design, use, bulk, location and spacing
of buildings in order to most effectively, and to the fullest extent
permissible under its powers of home rule, insure and preserve the public
health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the Village.
   Bounded entirely by the City of Cleveland and the Lake Erie shoreline, the
Village is incapable of geographic or territorial expansion. Although most of
the area of Cleveland, which surrounds the Village, is of nonresidential use
and character, because of its location within the metropolitan area, its
relationship to Lake Erie and the historical development of the community, the
Village has traditionally provided a unique residential environment affording a
wide choice of housing. The preservation and enhancement of this unique
residential setting and wide choice of housing opportunities, which is a
primary objective of the Village, is dependent upon the ability of the Village
to provide for the increasing costs of municipal services. The costs of these
services in the Village are met through real estate taxes, a municipal income
tax and through the Village's share of taxes levied upon the estates of its
deceased residents. Revenues from these sources as generated by the existing
development of the Village can no longer be relied upon to continue to defray
necessary and rapidly escalating Village expenses.
   The maintenance of the range of housing choices and the quality of the
Village as a residential community is established by the Village as the primary
goal for the future. To achieve this goal, the Village recognizes that new
development shall occur to renew and further expand housing choices within the
community and to provide the basis for meeting the increasing financial
requirements of municipal services.
   The officials of the Village have recognized that revisions and adjustments
to this existing Zoning Code are necessary for the Village to respond to
changes in development economics and techniques and market preferences.
   Therefore, after careful study, the legislative authority has adopted, with
the approval of the Planning Commission, an Updated Master Plan and Development
Policy. To carry out the Plan and Development Policy and to preserve and
protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general
welfare of the Village and its inhabitants, and to preserve the essential
residential values of the Village, the legislative authority of the Village has
adopted and enacted this Code setting forth standards, criteria, procedures,
regulations and controls for the use of land in the Village and the design,
use, bulk, location and spacing of buildings thereon which shall most
effectively utilize the highest professional skills and provide the maximum
flexibility of design, arrangements, spacing and construction of improvements
on the land, and the location and character of such uses and buildings and the
increase and distribution of populations resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
   1105.03 CONFLICT.
   Where a provision of this Code is found to be in conflict with any other
code or ordinance, or provision thereof, of the Village, such provision of this
Code shall prevail and be controlling.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
   1105.04 VALIDITY.
   Should any section or provision of this Code be declared invalid by a court
of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
Code as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the section or provision so
declared to be invalid. Nor shall the decision affect its application to
different facts or circumstances.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
   1105.05 FORM OF CODE.
   This Code is subdivided by titles. Each title is subdivided by chapters.
Each chapter is subdivided into sections which are numbered in sequence within
the chapter, commencing with the first section in Chapter
1105, which section is numbered
1105.01. The first figure before the decimal signifies the chapter and the two
figures "01" after the decimal signify the first section in that chapter. The
title and chapter headings herein have been inserted for convenience in
reference and are not intended to define or limit the scope of, or otherwise
affect, any provision in this Code.
(Ord 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
   1105.06 ILLUSTRATIONS; VISUAL INTERPRETATION.
   Illustrations, prototype or concept plans which Council may approve and
append to this Code from time to time are intended to clarify, supplement and
be applied along with the land planning and architectural design criteria to
fulfill the intent, purposes and objectives of this Code.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
   1105.07 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   (a)   No structure shall be located, erected, constructed, reconstructed,
moved, converted, or enlarged; nor shall any structure or land be used or be
designed to be used, nor shall any land be subdivided within the limits of the
Village except in full compliance with all the provisions of this Planning and
Zoning Code and, when required, after the lawful issuance of the certificates
(s) or permit(s) required by this Code.
   (b)   Existing lots, buildings, structures and uses of land that do not
comply with the regulations of this Planning and Zoning Code are subject to the
regulations set forth in Chapter
1129, Nonconformance.
   (c)   No lot, setback, open space, or other space shall be reduced in area
or dimensions so as to make such area or dimension less than the minimum
required by this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   No part of a setback, open space or other space provided for any
building or structure for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this
Code shall be included as part of a required setback, open space or other space
required under this Code for another building or structure not on the same lot.

   1127.01 INTENT.
   A primary objective of the Village is to encourage the preservation of the
traditional architectural character and image of the community. The
preservation and continued maintenance of the large residential estates, which
exist in many areas of the Village, shall contribute to the achievement of this
objective. Therefore, as a means to foster preservation and maintenance of the
buildings and grounds of such properties, the Village may consider an
application for a special permit for a conference center use on parcels within
the R-1 Standard Single-Family District, where such use shall result in the
preservation, restoration and maintenance of the original principal residential
structures and the preservation, restoration and maintenance of the general
character of the landscaped grounds associated with the original residence. No
special permit for conference center use shall be issued unless the Planning
Commission, with the advice of the Design Review Board, finds that the proposed
conference center use shall further the objectives of the Village and the
purposes and intent of this Code and this section, and that the proposed
conference center use shall have no substantial adverse affect upon adjoining
properties and the surrounding areas of the Village, and that the development
and operation of the proposed conference center use shall be in accordance with
the standards, requirements and procedures set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1127.02 DEFINITION AND USE.
   For the purposes of this chapter "conference center use" means the use of an
existing principal residential structure on a lot, developed and used in the
manner prescribed by this chapter, by one or more nonprofit colleges or
universities certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 1713.02 or by a charitable
corporation established pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 1702 for educational
conferences, seminars and meetings related to the educational and civic
improvement programs of such institutions and for the purpose of promoting the
cultural arts, horticulture, education and civic affairs of the community and
the institution.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1127.03 ISSUANCE PROCEDURES, APPLICATION INFORMATION AND PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   In any R-1 Standard Residential District, the Commissioner of Buildings may
issue a special permit for the location and use of a conference center as
described and according to the procedures prescribed in this chapter after
approval thereof by the Planning Commission. Approval of the issuance of a
special permit for a conference center may be given by the Commission upon
application made therefor by the owner of the property to be so used. Before
the issuance of such special permit, the Commission shall give public notice
and hold a public hearing. The application shall include or be accompanied by:
(a)    A description of the lot and the buildings and the improvements located
or to be located thereon with sufficient specificity to show compliance with

property and use, satisfactory to the Planning Commission;
(f)    Such additional evidence as the Commission may reasonably require to
demonstrate that the conditions and standards prescribed by this chapter for
the approval of such a special permit shall be complied with and maintained;
and
(g)    Evidence satisfactory to the Commission that the use of the conference
center shall not result in a loss of tax income to the Village.
   The Commission may impose such additional conditions for the issuance of a
special permit as it may deem necessary for the protection of the public peace,
health, safety and welfare, and for the preservation and protection of property
values and enjoyment of neighboring property.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1127.04 AREA AND YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   A conference center must be located on a lot at least six acres in area held
in one ownership. The minimum yard sizes prescribed in Section
1155.04 shall not apply, but instead the lot used as a conference center shall
have a minimum front yard of 350 feet, two side yards of at least 100 feet
each, and a minimum rear yard of 100 feet, except that, where the rear of the
lot adjoins Lake Erie or any public open space, no rear yard shall be required,
and except that the Planning Commission at the time of approval of use of the
property as a conference center, may approve the continued location of existing
accessory buildings within such minimum yard space. Landscaping shall be
provided to insure privacy to adjoining properties, and buildings and grounds
shall be maintained in attractive, safe and orderly condition in keeping with
community standards.

less than forty parking spaces, and may be located in part or entirely off the
premises if:
(a)    The nearest parking spaces are within 400 feet of the nearest boundary
of the lot upon which such use granted by special permit is located, measured
by a straight line between the points, and
(b)    The premises used for off-street parking are either owned or controlled
by the same ownership as the premises for which such special use permit may be
granted.
   Exterior lighting provided for the parking area or areas shall be
constructed and arranged to prevent the direct emission of light upon adjoining
lots or public streets.
(Ord. 1805. Passed 6-18-69.)
 
   1127.06 SCREENING OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE.
   Where five or more off-street parking spaces are provided, and are located
on a lot that adjoins or is across the street from a lot on which there is a
building containing dwelling units, such parking spaces shall be screened
therefrom by an opaque wall, a uniformly painted fence of fire resistant
material, or a strip of land at least four feet wide planted with shrubs that
form a dense screen. Such wall, fence or shrubs shall be at least three feet in
height but such wall or fence shall be not more than six feet in height. Such
wall, fence or shrubs located within fifteen feet of the intersection of two or
more streets, or the intersection of an access driveway and a street, shall
have a maximum height of three feet and a minimum height of two feet. The
required screening shall be maintained in good condition at all times. No signs
shall be attached to or hung from the required screening.

   1127.07 HOURS AND ATTENDANCE.
   A conference center may operate on any day, but only between 8:00 a.m. and
11:00 p.m. No conference center event shall have an attendance of more than 300
persons at any one time, except with prior approval of the Commissioner of
Buildings. Such prior approval shall be granted only if the Commissioner finds
that the attendance of more than 300 persons can safely be accommodated and
will not adversely affect the enjoyment of neighboring property. In making such
decision, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the degree to which
the attendance exceeds 300, the nature of the conference center event and the
hours during which such event shall take place.
(Ord. 1805. Passed 6-18-69.)
 
   1127.08 TERM OF PERMIT.
   Such special use permit shall be issued or renewed by the Commissioner of
Buildings, but not for a period of more than three years, as shall be approved
by the Planning Commission. Any failure or refusal of the permit holder to
comply with the ordinances of the Village or the standards and conditions of
the permit shall constitute revocation thereof. Any change in ownership or any
change in the user of the premises or of any part thereof shall render the
permit void unless within thirty days after such change application is made to
the Commissioner for transfer of such permit and such transfer shall be
approved by the Planning Commission.

   1133.01 INTENT.
   (a)    Regulations in this Title Five shall be considered minimum
requirements for the protection of the public health, safety, comfort, property
or general welfare, pursuant to the authority of the platting and land
subdivision statutes in Ohio R.C. Chapter 711, or such statutes hereinafter in
effect, and shall be construed most favorably to the Municipality as
encouraging standards of planning and development exceeding these basic and
minimum regulations.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 9-21-60.)
 
   (b)    The procedures in this chapter prescribe the steps by which the
subdivision of land may be accomplished. Subdivisions are classified as minor
and major subdivisions.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.02 MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   (a)    Definition. A proposed division of a parcel of land along an existing
public street, not involving the opening, widening or extension of any street
or road, and involving no more than five lots after the original tract has been
completely subdivided, shall be classified as a minor subdivision.
   (b)    Application. An application for approval for each minor subdivision
shall be filed by the developer with the secretary of the Planning Commission.
A plan shall be prepared at a scale of not less than fifty feet to the inch. It
shall show the proposed layout and dimensions of each lot together with all
common land included in the parcel to be subdivided. The Commission may require
the applicant to furnish sufficient information to show that the proposed
subdivision is in conformance with the Village Plan. The Commission shall take
action upon the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting after
submission of all required information.
   (c)    If the Commission determines the proposed subdivision is a minor
subdivision and is satisfied that it is in conformance with the Village Plan
and with all requirements of this Code, the Commission shall approve the minor
subdivision.
(Ord. 4113. Passed 9-22-21.)
 
   1133.03 RECORDING OF A MINOR SUBDIVISION.
   After approval of a minor subdivision application, the developer shall
submit either a metes and bounds, deed description, and/or plat in compliance
with all applicable County and State standards. If the same is certified by a
registered engineer, it shall be approved as herein provided. If not so
certified, it shall be presented to the Village Engineer for review. If it is
found to conform to the approved application and is otherwise satisfactory to
the Village Engineer, he shall so certify his approval thereon.
   When the description has been approved, the secretary, chairman or other
official as may be designated by the Planning Commission, shall stamp on the
conveyance "Approved by Bratenahl Planning Commission. The conveyance may then
be recorded in the office of the County Recorder. (Ord. 4176. Passed 1-18-23.)
 
   1133.04 MAJOR SUBDIVISION: PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)    Definition. A major subdivision is a division of a parcel of land,
shown as a unit or as contiguous units in the records of the County Auditor,
into two or more lots when such subdivision involves the opening, widening or
extension of any street or the granting of easements for the extension and
maintenance of sewer, water, storm drainage or other facilities. Any division
of a parcel of land into more than five lots is a major subdivision.
 
   (b)    Preliminary Plan. In order to explore the best design for a major
subdivision, the best relationship of the major subdivision to adjoining
subdivisions or undeveloped land, and to obtain the advice, suggestions and
requirements of the Planning Commission with respect to any plan of
improvements upon the parcel to be subdivided, a preliminary plan is required.
 
   (c)    Application for Approval of Preliminary Plan. Written application for
approval of a preliminary plan, accompanied by six black-on-white prints of the
preliminary plan and accompanied by the maps and information hereinafter
required, shall be submitted by the developer to the secretary of the
Commission for each proposed major subdivision. The plan shall be accurately
and clearly drawn at a scale of not less than 100 feet to one inch. Each print
of the preliminary plan shall be accompanied by maps and data, which either
separately or in combination shall show the following:
(1)    Streets: The layout, right-of-way, pavement widths, approximate grades
and names of streets;
(2)    Lot lines: The number of lots and their approximate dimensions;
(3)    Public land: Areas to be reserved or dedicated for parks, playgrounds or
other public uses;
(4)    Protective covenants: A summary of all protective convenants proposed;
(5)    Vicinity map: A map, such as a section of the 400' municipal map,
showing thereon the location of the proposed subdivision and relationship to
adjacent developments, streets and all community facilities which serve or
influence it;
(6)    Property line map: A plat showing existing and proposed lot lines,
bearings and distances of the parcel to be subdivided; location, width and
purpose of easements; the name, width and location of abutting streets
including location of pavements and sidewalk, structures on parcel within
twenty-five feet on adjoining property.
(7)    Utility map: A map, showing utilities on and adjacent to the parcel,
including location, size and invert elevations of all sewers, location and size
of water and gas mains, location of fire hydrants and electric power and
telephone poles;
(8)    Topographic map: A map, showing contours at two foot intervals based on
the County datum plane. It shall show approximate direction and gradient of
ground slope on immediately adjacent land; indicate subsurface condition of
tract if not typical; show watercourses, marshes, wooded areas, isolated
preservable trees and other significant features. The topography may be
compiled by photogrammetric methods and shall be at the same scale as the
preliminary plan;
(9)    Titles and certifications indicating present parcel designations
according to official records, name of developer, name and address of owners
and evidence of their consent to the subdivision, certification of registered
surveyor, scale and date of survey.
 
   (d)    Planning Commission Action. When the Commission has received all of
the maps, drawings, data and plans as above required, it shall hold a public
hearing upon the question of authorizing the developer to proceed. The
Commission shall notify, by first class mail, the owners as shown upon the
current records of the County Auditor, of adjoining unsubdivided land at least
ten days before the time and place of the meeting at which the proposed
subdivision is to be considered. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate the proceedings.
   For all subdivisions which are of such scope or at such locations as to
affect the design of coordinated neighborhood street pattern, or extensions to
adjoining unsubdivided land, or which include public sites, involve topographic
or unusual conditions, the Commission shall request an analysis and
recommendation from the staff of the Regional Planning Commission.
   The Commission shall act upon the application within thirty days from the
date when the application and all required maps, plans and data were received
by it or within such further time as may be agreed to by the developer.
   If the Planning Commission approves the preliminary plan, the chairman and
secretary shall affix their signatures to four copies thereof with a notation
that the developer is authorized to proceed thereon subject to such special
conditions, if any, as the Commission shall attach. After such approval the
Commission shall return one copy of the preliminary plan to the developer,
submit one copy to the Mayor, file one copy with the Clerk and retain one copy.
If the Commission fails to approve the preliminary plan, it shall state in
writing the reason or reasons for such action.
 
   (e)    Effect of Authorization to Proceed. The authorization to proceed on
the preliminary plan authorizes the developer to proceed with the preparation
of the final plat and assures him that within a six months' period from the
date of such authorization:
(1)    That there will be no objection to the general layout of streets, lots
and other features and the preliminary plan may serve as the basis for the
preparation of the final plat; and
(2)    That the developer may submit a final plat for the whole or part of the
subdivision, including all streets, utilities and appurtenances thereto to be
installed therein.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.05 MAJOR SUBDIVISION: PROCEDURE FOR FILING AND APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   (a)    Application: After an authorization to proceed, the developer shall
proceed with due diligence to complete the final plan. An application for a
final plat shall be filed within six months, unless the Planning Commission
extends the time. It shall include the original tracing of the final plat, the
original tracing of the drawings for the required improvements, three black-on-
white prints of each tracing, three sets of specifications and other maps, data

section, tract or lot; scale, shown graphically, north arrow, date.
M.    Approval statements for the Planning Commission and Council, Municipal
Engineer and other officials as may be required.
N.    The titles, certificates, statements, etc. set forth above shall be in
accord with the forms in Appendix I.
(2)    Drawings and specifications: Drawings showing cross sections, profiles,
elevations, construction details and specifications for all required land
improvements. They shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter
1137.
(3)    Certification by Municipal Engineer: Stating that the developer has:
A.    Designed and installed improvements in accordance with the provisions of
this Code and any conditions set forth by the Commission in their approval of
the preliminary plan, or
B.    Posted financial guarantees in sufficient amount to assure completion of
all required improvements.
C.    Protective covenants in final form, to be recorded separately.
D.    A statement that there are no unpaid taxes or special assessments against

(4)    Commissioner to keep plats. The Building Commissioner shall be the
custodian of all final plats for all the plotted lands in the Village of
Bratenahl, subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Planning
Commission. Such plats shall be maintained on file, be properly indexed, and
available for inspection by the public.
   The developer may obtain conditional approval of the plat and install the
required improvements before applying for approval of the final plat, or,
alternatively, he may apply for approval of the final plat and drawings and
specifications of required improvements concurrently and furnish performance
guarantee bond that he will install the improvements thereafter. If approved,
the developer may construct portions of the improvements before approval of
final plat and furnish performance guarantee bond for the construction of the
remaining improvements.
   The developer may apply for final plat approval for only that section of an
approved preliminary plan for a subdivision which he proposes to develop and
record as the first stage. However, the preliminary approval of any section
shall become void if an application for final plat approval is not submitted
within six months after approval of the preliminary plan, unless an extension
of time is granted by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 9-21-60; Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-72.)
 
   (b)    Review by Village Engineer: The secretary of the Commission shall
transmit two prints of each drawing and the specifications to the Village
Engineer for determination if:
(1)    The final plat conforms to the approved preliminary plans and any
special conditions or modification stipulated, and for correctness of
mathematical data and computations, and
(2)    The designs and details of the required improvements as shown on the
drawings and specifications are in conformance with the major street plan and
the improvement code and the construction standards in effect in the Village.
   One copy of each shall be returned to the Commission within ten days
indicating the Engineer's determinations.
 
   (c)    Action by the Planning Commission: If the Engineer finds the final
plat, drawings and specifications are satisfactory in regard to the aforesaid
provisions and if the subdivision complies with all other applicable provisions
of these regulations, the Planning Commission shall approve it. Action shall be
taken within thirty days after the meeting at which the application for
approval and all required plats, maps and data were submitted to the Commission
or an extension of time fixed by the Commission.
   The Commission shall act upon the final plat, drawings and specifications,
either separately or concurrently, but in no event shall it approve the final
plat for recording until the improvements are constructed by the developer or
their construction guaranteed by an approved surety bond. The amount of the
bond shall be the estimated cost of the improvements, as estimated by the
Village Engineer. The form of the bond shall be approved by the Village
Solicitor.
 
   (d)    Form of Approval: The approval of the final plat shall be indicated
by a certification to that effect on the original tracing of the plat with the
signature of the chairman and secretary of the Commission. The Commission shall
obtain one duplicate tracing thereof at the developer's expense before
returning the tracing to him. The reason for disapproval of a plat shall be
stated in the records of the Commission.
   The approval of the drawing and specifications for the required improvements
shall be indicated by a certificate to that effect on the original drawings and
specifications with the signature of the Village Engineer.
   Approval of the improvements as constructed shall likewise be certified by
the Engineer.
 
   (e)    Recording: The developer shall file the approved final plat in the
office of the County Recorder. The approval of the Planning Commission shall
expire within sixty days unless within that period the plat shall have been
duly filed and recorded and the Commission so notified by the developer. If the
final plat is revised in any manner after approval, a new approval shall be
necessary.
 
   (f)    Effect of Approval and Recording: If drawings and specifications for
improvements are approved, the construction of same may be started; after
satisfactory construction the final plat may be approved and recorded, building
permits may be issued, and lots may be sold, leased or transferred.
   If drawings and specifications for improvements are approved and
construction guaranteed, the final plat may be approved and recorded,
construction of improvements started, building permits issued, and lots may be
sold, leased or transferred.
   Occupancy permits for a building shall not be issued until streets and
utilities are accepted by Council for public use. However, a temporary
certificate may be issued upon the condition that the developer assumes all
responsibility for maintenance until officially accepted by Council.
 
   (g)    Planning Commission Rules: The Planning Commission may adopt rules
and regulations to supplement the provisions of this chapter and which are not
inconsistent with the Code.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.06 LANDS FOR PUBLIC USE.
   (a)    Dedication for Public Use: If the final plat indicates land for
public use, the plat shall be submitted to Council for acceptance of dedication
of any public land, and acceptance of any easement before it is recorded. The
acceptance of any street or utility for public use and maintenance and the
naming of any street shall be by separate action of Council.
 
   (b)    Land Reserved for Public Use: Council may request, by resolution, a
developer to set aside, reserve or offer for sale, land for streets, parks,
playgrounds, schools or other public uses shown upon a duly approved
thoroughfare, park and recreation or comprehensive plan for a period of ninety
days after the application for approval of a preliminary plan, or for a longer
period as may be mutually agreed, to allow the Village time to acquire such
land.
   During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees or topsoil shall
be removed or destroyed, no grading shall be done, nor shall any land so
reserved be put to any use whatsoever except on written approval of the
Planning Commission.
   If no sites for a recreational use are shown within a proposed subdivision
on such an approved plan, the developer may be required to contribute a pro-
rata fee to a land acquisition fund for recreation use in accordance with
standards established for the neighborhood to be served.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.07 VILLAGE MAP.
   In order that proposed subdivisions may be properly planned and reviewed, a
map of the Village showing all streets and lot lines shall be kept current and
maintained on file by the Clerk. Preliminary plans, when approved, shall be
indicated on a print of the Village Map, and every final plat or deed, when
recorded, shall be added to the tracings therefor.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.08 RESUBDIVIDING, LOT LINE ADJUSTMENT AND LOT CONSOLIDATION.
   (a)   Resubdividing. Two or more contiguous parcels in a recorded
subdivision that are either (1) undeveloped and owned by the developer or (2)
developed and owned by separate entities, may be reconfigured, subject to the
subdivision review procedures established in this Code. The application for
resubdividing shall be signed by all owners of the lots to be reconfigured.
   (b)   Lot Line Adjustment.
      (1)   Definition. “Lot line adjustment” means the movement or relocation
of a common property line between two or more existing adjacent parcels where
the land taken from one parcel is added to an adjacent parcel, resulting in no
change in the number of parcels than existed prior to the adjustment.
      (2)   Application. An application for a lot line adjustment shall be
submitted for administrative review. The application shall include a metes and
bounds, deed description, and/or plat prepared in compliance with all
applicable County and State standards.
      (3)   Review. The proposed lot line adjustment shall be approved
administratively only when it results in parcels that comply with all
applicable zoning and subdivision requirements, as determined by the Building
Commissioner and Village Engineer.
   (c)   Lot Consolidation.
      (1)   Definition. “Lot consolidation” means combining two or more
contiguous and adjacent lots that are owned in common by the applicant into
fewer number of lots by the elimination of one or more lot lines and where the
boundary of the combined lots remain the same.
      (2)   Whenever adjacent lots owned in common are required by this Code to
be consolidated, a copy of the recorded consolidation or assembly plat shall be
provided to the village prior to the issuance of a building permit. If the
proposed construction requires approval by the Planning Commission and/or the
Architectural & Design Review Board, the applicant may submit a notarized
letter of intent to consolidate the property as part of the requisite
Commission and/or Board review application.
         (Ord. 4113. Passed 9-22-21.)
 
   1133.09 PUBLIC SEWER AND WATER.
   Land shall not be subdivided as provided in this chapter unless both public
sewer and public water will be available prior to occupancy of building lots.
No building permits shall be issued unless such sewer and water are available
to the building lot.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1133.10 MODIFICATIONS.
   Where the Planning Commission finds that the land involved in a subdivision
is of such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitations, or is
affected by such topographical conditions, or is to be devoted to such usage
that it is impossible or impracticable in the particular proposal for the
developer to conform fully to a provision of this Title Five, the Commission
may accept such modification as may be reasonable if within the general intent
and purpose of these Regulations.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 9-21-60.)
 
   1133.11 MODIFICATIONS FOR PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AREAS.
   The regulations and procedures set forth in this Title Five may be modified
by the Planning Commission to the degree necessary to accomplish the objectives
and standards required for the review and approval of planned residential
developments, as set forth in Chapters
1162 and
1164 of the Planning and Zoning Code. If a planned residential development
entails a subdivision of land, nothing set forth in Chapters
1162 and
1164 shall exempt the developer from subdivision plat approval as specified in
this chapter, but, with the approval of the Commission, the review procedures
set forth herein and in Chapter
1164 may proceed concurrently.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1133.12 FEES.
   The owner or developer shall deposit with the Village funds in the amount
fixed by the Village Engineer for all costs and expenses incurred for approval
of preliminary plans and the final plat. Such fees shall be based on the
ordinance governing fees and rates of compensation for the Village Engineer.

   1135.01 INTENT.
   The planning criteria set forth in this chapter shall apply to the
subdivision of land, planned residential developments and their development and
redevelopment, unless specified otherwise. They are intended to be fundamental
criteria, to be applied with professional skill, in the planning of land so as
to produce attractive and harmonious neighborhoods and development areas,
convenient and safe streets and functional building sites. All of the criteria
may not be applicable in each subdivision or development.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1135.02 TOPOGRAPHY.
   Detailed topographic maps shall be utilized in the land planning. All
developments shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the land
in order to utilize the natural contours, to economize in the construction of
drainage facilities, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize
destruction of trees and topsoil. The natural features and other distinctive
characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create
functional variations in the neighborhoods.
(a)    Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat, or of very gentle
undulations, shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage
courses. All building sites, if possible, shall be above the street grade. On
more irregular topography, streets shall be designed to avoid extensive cuts
and fills. They should follow the ridges or be planned approximately parallel
to contour lines.
(b)    Natural Drainage. All developments, particularly of land of very gentle
slopes, shall be designed to take advantage of natural contours so that all the
land can be drained with the minimum of reshaping. Unless water courses or
drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines,
or areas held as common land, shall be approximately parallel to the natural or
straightened course, and only where such a plan is not practical may side lot
lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course.
(c)    Natural Features. Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, view of the lake, hills and other focal points within the site, and
distant views outside the subdivision shall be coordinated with the design to
obtain natural variety and interest in each neighborhood and more attractive
building sites. Trees, top soil and other natural resources shall be preserved
and utilized in the development of the subdivision. Certain required dimensions
may be varied to preserve such features, when approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
(d)    Present Buildings. Whenever practical, existing residences having
unusually desirable architectural characteristics, and their surrounding
landscape development, should be conserved and considered as focal points, and
similarly the site design should be coordinated with such residences located on
an adjoining site.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1135.03 PLANNING OF STREETS AND PRIVATE WAYS.
   Streets shall be designed according to the function served, the use of
abutting land and other standards of street design set forth in Chapter
1137 and set forth below:
(a)    Major Streets: Function primarily for the movement of fast traffic
between points of heavy traffic generation and shall be planned to develop an
overall system. The right-of-way widths shall be in accordance with standards
which may, from time to time, be included in Chapter
1137.
   Major streets shall contain as few intersections as possible. Where a
development joins a major street, the Planning Commission may require marginal
access streets, or such other treatment as the fronting of lots on
perpendicular local streets, in order to protect the residential property from
the movement of heavy traffic and to eliminate driveways into the major street.
(b)    Secondary Streets: Function for collecting traffic from local streets
and distributing it onto major streets and as such streets they should normally
have more intersections with local streets and fewer with main streets.
Secondary streets shall be planned for continuity and directed to one or more
focal points or centers of traffic generation.
(c)    Local Streets: Shall provide direct access to each lot, except as
modified in this Code for planned residential development areas. For all types
of developments they shall be planned for convenient circulation in the
principal direction of travel. As previously described, the layout shall be
related to the topography and natural features. The street pattern shall be
indirect, and yet continuous, to prevent through traffic. The pattern shall be
formed of straight, moderately winding, curved loop, angular, cul-de-sac or ell
streets. There shall be an underlying systematic neighborhood pattern. Gridiron
and other rigid geometrical systems shall be avoided.
(d)    Private Ways: Shall be planned to provide access into planned
residential development areas from streets, to provide for internal circulation
of vehicles within the development area and to provide access to individual
dwelling units. Such private ways shall be designed to prohibit through traffic
and to provide sufficient access for service vehicles and public emergency
vehicles Such private ways shall be private and shall be established by
recorded covenant, declaration, easement or deed restriction, with provisions
therein to assure access for the benefit of all individual dwelling units
within the development area and to provide for the private maintenance of such
ways by the benefitted property therein. Design, construction and maintenance
of such private ways shall be in accordance with Chapter
1137 and shall be appropriate to the overall design, scale and use of the
planned residential area and shall be approved by the Village Engineer, except
that all such private ways shall have a width of not less than twenty-one feet.
(e)   Extension of Streets: Where a subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land,
certain streets shall be planned to extend to the boundary lines so that all
undeveloped parcels may be subdivided and a coordinated street system obtained.
(f)   Intersections: Streets shall be designed to intersect as nearly to ninety
degree angle as possible. No street shall intersect another at an angle less
than sixty degrees. The intersection of more than two streets at a point, or
with center line offsets of less than 125 feet, shall not be permitted. T-
intersections shall predominate. Cross-intersections shall be avoided.
Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of not
less than thirty feet for major streets, twenty feet for secondary streets and
ten feet for local streets.
(g)   Right-of-Way Widths:
(1)   Local Streets: Right-of-way widths for all local streets shall be not
less than fifty feet.
A.   Turning facilities at end of cul-de-sac: Turning facilities at the end of
a cul-de-sac shall have a minimum turning radius of seventy-five feet except
that T or Y turning facilities may be approved by the Planning Commission in
unusual locations.
B.   Marginal access streets: Right-of-way widths for all marginal access
streets shall be not less than fifty feet.
(2)   Secondary streets: Right-of-way widths for all secondary streets shall be
not less than sixty feet.
(3)   Major Streets: The right-of-way shall be in accord with either State
Highway, County or Village standards, depending on the authority constructing.
It may vary from 80 to 120 feet.
(h)   Grades of Streets: Street grades shall be not less than 0.4 percent in
order to provide adequate surface drainage. However, the Commission may permit
a minimum of 0.25 percent where necessary because of topographic or other
conditions.
(i)   Driveways and Curb Cuts: Driveways and curb cuts shall be located in
accordance with a subdivision plan, a site development plan or a plan for a
development area. They may be grouped in pairs or spaced separately as the
Planning Commission authorizes. Intersections of driveways at major streets
shall be located in relation to curves and grades to cause the least
interference with and danger to the traffic on the major street. Driveways
shall be provided with turn-arounds to avoid backing a vehicle onto a major
street.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)

street parking and other required facilities, and shall be designed for group
development and not according to the typical lot and street pattern.
 
   (e)   Partial Blocks. If the site of a proposed subdivision is of such
limited dimensions so as not to comprise an element of a neighborhood pattern
and would result in a partial block with some fractional or odd-shaped lots,
the Planning Commission may plan the neighborhood and request the developer to
incorporate the subdivision into the neighborhood plan, and all lots that
cannot be conforming as to depth or other regulations shall be retained by the
developer in the original parcel and be not approved as a building site or
recorded as a separate lot.
 
   (f)    Pedestrian Ways. Pedestrian ways of not less than twenty-five feet
right-of-way and in a straight line, may be required across blocks exceeding

   1137.01 INTENT.
   The land improvements which are required by this chapter for standard
residential subdivisions shall be designed, furnished and installed by the
developer in accordance with the provisions of this Code and other codes of the
Municipality. They shall be installed before the final plat is approved, or, in
lieu thereof, agreements to install shall be approved concurrently with the
approval of the final plat.
   The developer shall dedicate all land required for rights of way within the
subdivision and to furnish and install all improvements to provide a complete
and coordinated system of streets and all utilities for the neighborhood, in
accord with the thoroughfare, water and sewer plans adopted.
   The land improvements which are required by this chapter shall also be
applicable for all planned development areas and shall be designed, furnished
and installed by the developer in accordance with the provisions of this Code
or other codes of the Municipality, unless a more specific provision relating
only to planned development areas is applicable, or unless the Planning
Commission recommends and Council approves an adjustment or variation of a
requirement hereof in the review process set forth in Chapter
1164. Whenever the term subdivision is used in this chapter, the term shall be
deemed to include a planned development area submitted under the provisions of
Chapter
1164, whether or not a subdivision of land is involved therein.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1137.02 REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    Land for the right-of-way for the opening or extension of any street
within or on the boundary of the subdivision shall be dedicated by the
developer, and all easements for the extensions of utilities shall be provided.
 
   (b)    Improvements, such as utilities, pavements, walks and other land
improvements as required by this chapter shall be designed, furnished and
installed as hereinafter set forth or required by other codes of the
Municipality. The improvements shall be of such sizes and capacities as are
required for the development of the proposed subdivision and of such extra
sizes as may be necessary to serve nearby land which is an integral part of the
neighborhood service or drainage areas.
   The developer shall be required to extend the improvements to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision or planned development area, the Planning
Commission may require the developer to construct off-site extensions of the
improvements. Procedures for providing any necessary extra-size and off-site
improvements and general standards for prorating costs are set forth in Section
1137.12.
 
   (c)    The developer shall provide and install within the proposed
subdivision the following land improvements:
Grading             Streets and Lots
Drainage facilities Sewer system

   1137.03 GRADING.
   The developer shall grade each subdivision in order to establish street
grades, floor elevations of buildings and lot grades in proper relation to each
other and to existing topography, as follows:
(a)    Grading Plan. A master lot grading plan shall be prepared for the street
and building site areas along with the street improvement details. Such master
grading plan shall show proposed typical building footprints and the grading of
areas adjacent thereto.
(b)    Grading Standards. The grading shall be in accord with the standards
established by the Village Engineer. The plans may be based on any of the
following grading systems:
(1)   Where there is a ridge along rear lot lines, and the lots drain to the
streets;
(2)    Where parts of all lots drain to a swale or ditch along rear lot lines;
(3)    Where there is a gentle or a steep cross slope and drainage onto
adjoining properties. Such drainage shall be controlled by the installation of
swales and/or yard inlets connected to piped systems;
(4)    Where the land is relatively flat and adequate drainage must be formed;
(5)    Or, a variation of the above conditions.
The grading of the roadway shall extend the full width of the right of way plus
the full width of any adjacent utility easement. Tree lawns shall be granted at
a gradient of not less than two percent (2%) or more than three percent (3%)
upward from the curb to the sidewalk or property line, wherever possible.
(c)    Individual Site Grading. Each application for a building permit shall
include, in addition to the detailed plans for the proposed structure, a
Topographical Survey and a Site Grading Plan. The format and required
information for such survey and grading plan shall conform to the prototype
entitled "Sample Topographical Survey and Grading Plan (Pre-Construction and
As-Built)" which is on file in the office of the Building Inspector and the
Village Engineer. No permit to build shall be issued by the Building Inspector
without prior approval of such Topographical Survey and Grading Plan (Pre-
Construction) by the Village Engineer. Each building site shall then be graded
in conformance with the approved plan.
   Prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy, an applicant shall file
with the Building Inspector a final Site Grading Plan (As-Built) utilizing as
its background the aforementioned Topographical Survey and Grading Plan (Pre-
Construction) previously approved by the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer
will review the "As-Built" plan to determine conformance with the intent of the
approved Pre-Construction site grading design. Should the Village Engineer find
any significant deviations in the "As-Built" conditions, he shall advise the
Building Inspector of corrective actions to be taken by the applicant before a
Certificate of Occupancy may be issued. Should the Village Engineer find the
"As-Built" information as submitted to be acceptable, he shall so advise the
Building Inspector and a Certificate of Occupancy may be issued.
   Topographical Surveys and Grading Plans (Pre-Construction and As-Built)
shall be prepared by either a Professional Engineer or Professional Surveyor
licensed to practice in the State of Ohio.

water way. The system shall have a capacity to serve the subdivision and
drainage area of which it is a part. The system shall include pipes, culverts,
manholes, catchbasins, drain inlets and a connection for each lot.
(b)    The developer may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an
easement to the Municipality for a drainage channel not less in width than
required by a plan or standards adopted by the Municipality, or by the existing
topography along the watercourse. The developer may rechannel any watercourse
through his property in order to contain the storm drain flow within a lesser
width. The developer shall be responsible for clearing the drainage way of all
debris as a condition of acceptance.
(c)    The drainage system shall be designed in accord with standards of the
Municipality. The developer shall construct and pay for all sewers up to and
including twenty-four inches in diameter if it traverses his subdivision and is
necessary to serve a drainage area of which it is a part. If extra-size or off-
site storm sewers are required, standards for prorating costs are set forth in

   1137.12 EXTRA-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   The utilities, pavement and other land improvements as required and set
forth in this Code shall be designed, of such sizes and capacities and as
required for the development of the proposed subdivision and of extra sizes
and/or extensions as may be necessary to serve nearby land which is an integral
part of the neighborhood service or drainage area.
(a)    Extra-Size Improvements. Where extra-size improvements are required the
developer, in addition to the cost of pavement and improvements necessary to
serve the proposed subdivision or planned development area, may be required to
pay a proportionate share of the cost of extra-size improvements to serve the
proposed development and nearby land which is an integral part of the
neighborhood service drainage area. Such costs for extra-size improvements
shall be established pursuant to subsection (d) hereof. Where extra-size
improvements are required, the Municipality may construct the extra-size
utility and require a deposit in advance from the developer for the cost of the
utility he is required to install plus his portion of other costs, and the
Municipality may assess, against the benefitted property owners of the service
or drainage area, the balance of the costs to the extent allowed by law.
(b)    Extensions to Boundaries. The developer shall be required to extend the
improvements to the boundary of the proposed subdivision to serve adjoining
unsubdivided land. However, where the Planning Commission determines that a
connecting street is necessary for the future subdividing of adjoining land,
but the present construction of pavement and/or utilities therein are not
warranted, the Commission may require the dedication of land, the pavement
intersections constructed, utilities extended at least five feet beyond the
pavement, and connections provided and made available for the future extension
by other developers.
(c)    Off-Site Extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Municipality may require as a condition
precedent to approval of a preliminary development plan and final plat,
assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided as follows:
(1)    If the Commission finds the extensions across undeveloped areas would
not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties for a
municipal expense until some future time, the developer may be required, if he
wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain necessary easements or
rights-of-way and construct and pay for extensions. Such improvements shall be
available for connections by developers of adjoining land, or
(2)    The Municipality may construct and pay for the extensions and assess the
costs to the owners benefited and require a deposit from the developer as
described in subsection (a) hereof. The Municipality may establish a rotary
fund to pay for such development costs and not collect the assessments on the
intervening land until it is developed.
(d)    Proportionate Costs. In making determinations for proportionate costs
for the construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the
Commission and Council shall consider, in addition to the standards set forth
elsewhere in this Code and other regulations of the Municipality, the following
conditions:
(1)    The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision;
(2)    The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in relation to
present streets;
(3)    The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for water;
(4)    The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision;
(5)    The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity, and
(6)    Any other condition it may find pertinent.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1137.13 REVIEW AND INSPECTION; AS-BUILT TRACINGS ON RECORD.
   The design of the water system, storm and sanitary sewerage systems and
roadways shall be in accordance with the various aforesaid standards and
requirements. Drawings and specifications for the improvements shall be
reviewed and approved by the Municipal Engineer, and the installation shall be
subject to his continuous inspection.
   At the completion of the construction, and before acceptance, the developer
shall furnish the Municipality a set of record or "as-built" tracings showing
the locations, sizes and elevations of all underground utilities.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 9-21-60.)
 
   1137.14 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION.
   (a)    Type of Guarantees. The developer may execute and file with the
Municipality financial guarantees in lieu of actual installation or completion
of the required improvements concurrently with the application for approval of
the final plat. Such guarantees may be in the form of a performance or surety
bond, a certified check or any other type of surety approved by the
Municipality.
 
   (b)    Terms. The terms of such guarantees shall be determined by the
Planning Commission, however, they shall not be for a longer period than
eighteen months unless Council, by resolution, extends the time. Bonds shall be
executed by the applicant as principal with a surety company authorized in the
State of Ohio and shall be in a form satisfactory to the Village Solicitor.
 
   (c)    Amount of Guarantee. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total cost of materials, labor and engineering required
to install or construct the improvements, plus ten percent for contingencies.
Such costs shall be determined by the Municipal Engineer. When any portion of
an improvement has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily completed, a
reduction in the bonds, or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the estimated
costs of such completed improvements may be authorized.
   
   (d)    Progressive Installation. The developer may apply for final approval
and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such a
progressive unit development procedure, the installation of required
improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the
subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
(Ord. 1526. Passed 9-21-60.)
 
   1137.15 STREET OR PRIVATE WAY MAINTENANCE.
   The developer shall guarantee the construction and material of the street or
private way improvements in a subdivision or development area for a twelve-
month period after completion of construction and approval thereof by the
Village Engineer, and in order to secure the guarantee, he shall deposit an
amount equal to three percent (3%) of the total cost of the construction of
street or private way improvements into the Private Way Maintenance Fund, which
is hereby established, for the benefit of the Municipality or unit owners in a
planned development area. Such Fund shall be administered by the Village and
the funds may be utilized by the Municipality or unit owners to make necessary
repairs or replacements during such guarantee period and, at the end of the
guarantee period, any unused portion of such money shall be returned to the
owner or developer.
(Ord. 2573. Passed 2-21-90.)
 
   1137.16 INSURANCE.
   The developer agrees to indemnify and save harmless the Municipality against
and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and expense on account of
damage to property of, or injury to or death of, the parties hereto or third
person, caused by, growing out of or in any way whatsoever attributable to the
construction of such improvements and the use of a street delineated on the
subdivision plat during the construction. The developer further agrees, but
without limiting its liability to indemnify the Municipality to carry liability
insurance contracts with a reliable insurance company covering the period of
construction in the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) to one
million dollars ($1,000,000) for injury to or death of persons and in the sum
of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) to one million dollars ($1,000,000)
for damage to or destruction of property, which insurance contracts shall
include the Municipality as a named insured. The developer agrees to maintain
on file with the Municipality during the period of construction, certificates
or memoranda of insurance evidencing that such insurance contracts are in
force.
(Ord. 2703. Passed 3-11-93.)
 
   1137.17 FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS.
   In the event the developer fails to complete the installation of all land
improvements in a standard residential district subdivision with dedicated
streets according to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the
Municipality upon proper notice may complete the same utilizing such portion of
the unreleased money or bonds for the faithful performance of the work as may
be required therefor.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1137.18 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND OCCUPANCY.
   For standard residential subdivisions a building permit may be issued and
construction started after the completion of the underground utilities. After a
temporary pavement is constructed a temporary certificate of occupancy,
including a statement that the Municipality is not liable for maintenance of
such improvements, may be issued, provided the developer furnishes a bond in an
amount required by the Municipality guaranteeing that all streets shall be
maintained in a passable and reasonable condition until such time as the final
pavement is completed and accepted for use and maintenance.

   1144.01 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    “Telecommunication” means technology permitting the passage of
information from the sender to one or more receivers in a usable form by means
of any electromagnetic system.
 
   (b)    “Wireless telecommunications antenna” means an antenna designed to
transmit or receive communications as authorized by the Federal Communications
Commission excluding all amateur radio operators' antennas.
 
   (c)    “Wireless telecommunications equipment building” means the structure
in which the electronic receiving and transmitting equipment for a wireless
telecommunications facility is housed.
 
   (d)    “Wireless telecommunications facility” means a facility consisting of
the equipment and structures involved in receiving telecommunications or radio
signals from a mobile radio communications source and transmitting those
signals to a central switching computer which connects the mobile unit with the
land based telephone and/or communication lines.
 
   (e)    “Wireless telecommunications tower” means a structure intended to
support equipment used to transmit and/or receive telecommunications signals
including monopoles, guyed and lattice construction steel structures.
 
   (f)   “Monopole” means a single, slender and typically cylindrical, vertical
structure to which antennas or antenna support structures are affixed.
 
   (g)    “Lattice” means a framework or structure of crossed metal strips or
struts and braces constructed vertically in the form of a triangle or square
which tapers from the foundation to the top.
 
   (h)    “Substantial evidence” means more than a mere scintilla of evidence.
It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion.
 
   (i)    “Technically suitable” means the location of a wireless
telecommunication antenna(s) reasonably serves the purpose for which it is
intended within the band width of frequencies for which the owner or operator
of the antenna(s) has been licensed by the FCC to operate without a significant
loss of communication capability within developed areas of the Village.
(Ord. 2969. Passed 3-17-99.)
 
   1144.02 INTENT.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities are permitted in “T-1" Districts and
as conditional uses in a variety of zoning districts contingent upon a number
of specific conditions and requirements being met. These criteria are in place
in an attempt to minimize any adverse safety, public welfare or visual impact
through buffering, siting, design and construction, and reducing the need for
new towers.
(Ord. 2969. Passed 3-17-99.)
 
   1144.03 USE REGULATIONS.
   (a)    General Standards. This section applies to all wireless
telecommunications facilities independent of the zoning district in which they
are to be located. These general standards are to be supplemented with the
provisions for the particular applications specified in subsections (b) and (c)
hereof.
(1)    Location. 
A.   No new wireless communications tower will be allowed within a two thousand
five hundred (2,500) foot radius of an existing wireless tower. The Planning
Commission may waive this requirement with the approval of Council for the
purpose of the clustering of towers so long as the towers are visually
compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.
B.   The location of the tower and equipment building shall comply with all
natural resource protection standards established in this chapter - including
floodplain, wetlands and steep slope regulations.
C.   A tower may not be located on a building or structure that is listed on an
historic register, or is in an historic district.
(2)    Area. A minimum lot area of one (1) acre shall be required for a tower.
In addition, lot area shall be sufficient to provide for all requirements of
setbacks, yards, and building coverage as specified in the underlying zoning
district.
(3)    Tower Type. Monopole or lattice wireless communication towers, which do
not utilize guy wires, and their associated supporting buildings shall be
allowed in the Village. A wireless telecommunications tower which is supported
by guy wires shall only be permitted if the applicant can prove that a monopole
or lattice tower not requiring guy wires is not reasonably feasible, due to
noneconomic reasons, such as specific site conditions, or is required to
provide wireless communications to a specific area that cannot be served by a
guyless monopole tower. In the event guy wires are required to support the
wireless telecommunications tower, the guy wires shall be considered part of
the wireless telecommunications facility and shall meet all setback and yard
requirements.
(4)    Tower Design. A Tower shall be designed to have sufficient structural
capacity to allow for at least three (3) providers to be located on the
structure when constructed to the maximum allowable height. Towers and antenna
shall be designed to withstand sustained winds of at least 100 miles per hour
with one-half (1/2) inch of icing. The wireless communication facility shall
also be designed to show that the applicant has enough space on its site for an
equipment building large enough to accommodate at least three (3) providers. If
the equipment building is initially constructed to accommodate only one user,
space shall be reserved on-site for equipment building expansion to accommodate
up to al least two (2) additional providers.
(5)    Equipment Shelters/Buildings. Underground equipment shelters are
encouraged especially in non-industrial districts, and may be requested by the
Planning Commission. In the event of co-location, all additional wireless
telecommunications equipment shelters shall either be shared with all other
providers utilizing the wireless telecommunications facility, or in the event
such facility sharing is not feasible, any additional wireless
telecommunications equipment shelters shall be attached to any existing shelter
and shall be constructed of similar materials and utilize a design similar to
any existing shelter located on such a property.
(6)    Fencing. A security fence eight feet in height with barbed wire around
the top shall completely surround the tower, equipment building and any guy
wires.
(7)    Buffer. Required buffer plantings shall be determined by the Village
Planner and the following minimum plantings shall be located around the
perimeter of the security fence:
A.   A landscaped buffer area of not less than fifteen (15) feet in depth shall
be placed between the wireless telecommunication facilities and the public
rights-of-way and any adjacent properties from which a direct view can be had
of the facilities, other than the tower itself.
B.   The fifteen (15) foot landscaped buffer area shall consist of an evergreen
screen of either a solid six (6) foot hedge, or a row of evergreen trees
planted and spaced no more than ten (10) feet apart. These trees and shrubs
shall be planted in any configuration which will best serve to buffer the site.
C.   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the maximum
extent possible.
(8)    Compatibility.
A.   To the maximum extent possible, the entire facility must be aesthetically
and architecturally compatible with the environment. The use of residentially
compatible exterior materials such as wood, brick, or stucco is required for
associated equipment buildings, which shall be designed to architecturally
match the exterior of structures within the neighborhood. In no case will metal
or concrete block exteriors be allowed for accessory buildings.
B.   The tower itself must be of such design and treated with an architectural
material so that it is camouflaged or blends in with surrounding uses so as to
be visually compatible with the neighborhood. The tower shall be painted a non-
contrasting gray or similar color minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise
required by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA).
(9)    Co-Location. No new wireless communication facility may be erected if
there is a technically suitable space for a wireless communication facility
available on an existing wireless communication tower within the applicant's
search area in which the new wireless communication antenna is to be located.
With the permit application, the applicant shall list the location of every
tower, building or structure that could support the proposed antenna so as to
allow it to serve its intended function.
   The applicant must demonstrate that a technically suitable location is not
reasonably available on an existing tower, building or structure and include
the reasons therefor. If another communication tower is technically suitable,
the applicant must show that it has requested to co-locate on the existing
tower and the co-location request was rejected by the owner of the tower along
with the reasons for said rejection. In all circumstances, owners of existing
towers shall promptly respond to requests for co- location, but in no event
shall they respond in more than thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
written request for co-location. If another communication tower is technically
suitable, the applicant must further show that it has offered to allow the
owner of the other tower to co-locate an antenna on the applicant's tower on
reciprocal terms and that the offer was not accepted.
(10)    Arbitration of co-location disputes. As an additional condition of
issuing the permit to construct and operate the tower in the Village, the
owner/operator of the tower is required to sign a statement that all disputes
with other providers concerning co-location and the terms and conditions of co-
location shall be submitted to commercial arbitration under a system selected
by the parties but if the parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices
of the Commercial Arbitration Provision of the American Arbitration
Association.
(11)    Discontinued use. If at any time the use of the facility is
discontinued for one hundred and eighty (180) days, a designated local official
may declare the facility abandoned. The facility's owner/operator will be
contacted and instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within one
hundred and eighty (180) days, or dismantle and remove the facility. If
reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the permit will expire on the three
hundred and sixty first (361st) day. In the event that a facility is abandoned,
the Village reserves the right, after written notice to the owner, to claim all
right, title and interest in said facility for what ever use it deems
appropriate.
(12)    Bond. The owner or operator shall be required, as a condition of
issuance of a zoning certificate, to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to
the Village Solicitor of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per
vertical foot from natural grade of the wireless telecommunication tower to the
highest point or antenna which bond shall insure that an abandoned, obsolete or
destroyed wireless communication antenna or tower shall be removed as provided
in subsection (a)(11) hereof.
(13)   Annual inspection. Within sixty (60) days prior to each anniversary date
of the issuance of the zoning certificate for a wireless telecommunication
facility, the owner/operator of such facility shall cause an inspection to be
completed of the facility by a State-certified engineer, at the expense of the
owner/operator, and a certificate as to the structural integrity and general
safety of the entire facility and its components shall be issued by such
engineer to the Village within thirty (30) days following such anniversary.
Upon receipt of said certificate, the Building Inspector shall inspect the
facility for compliance with this chapter.
(14)    Miscellaneous. 
A.   Advertising. No advertising is permitted anywhere on the facility.
B.   Lighting. The tower shall not be artificially lighted except to assure
safety or as required by the FAA.
C.   Signage. Warning signs shall be posted around the facility with an
emergency telephone number of whom to contact in the event of an emergency.
(15)    Approvals. An application must be considered and approved by the
Planning Commission and Village Council with a subsequent Building Permit
issued by the Building Inspector.
 
   (b)    Permitted Use In Designated Overlay Districts. A wireless
telecommunications facility is permitted in those areas within the Village
zoned as a “T-1 Overlay District” which overlay districts have been determined
to be areas where the erection of a wireless telecommunication facility is
technically suitable, aesthetically acceptable and economically viable for
applicants.
 
   (c)    Conditional Use. In any other district not designated as a “T-
1 Overlay District” a wireless telecommunications facility may be approved only
as a conditional use subject to the following conditions:
(1)    Sole use on a lot. A wireless telecommunications facility is permitted
as a sole use on a lot subject to the following:
A.   Minimum yard requirements. The minimum distance from a parcel on which a
tower is proposed to any single-family use or district lot line shall be five
hundred (500) feet. The minimum distance from a parcel on which a tower is
proposed to a school/day care center/public park/residential lot line shall be
five hundred (500) feet. The minimum distance from a parcel on which a tower is
proposed to any nearby structure not previously stated in this subsection shall
be equal to the height of the tower. All side, rear and setback requirements
must be met.
B.   The maximum height of a tower, including antenna, shall be that which does
not require identification markers or painting by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
C.   The maximum size of equipment building shall be three hundred (300) square
feet for a single shelter or, if there is more than one, than seven hundred and
fifty (750) total square feet.
(2)    Combined with another use. A wireless telecommunications facility is
permitted on a property with an existing use, or on a vacant parcel subject to
the following conditions:
A.   The existing use on the property may be any permitted use in the district
or any lawful nonconforming use, and need not be affiliated with the wireless
telecommunications provider.
B.   The wireless telecommunications facility shall be fully automated and
unattended on a daily basis, and shall be visited only for periodic
maintenance.
C.   The minimum lot area shall be the area needed to accommodate the tower
(and guy wires, if used), the equipment building, security fence and buffer
planting. If the title to the land on which the wireless telecommunications
facility is located is conveyed to the owner of the telecommunications
facility, the land remaining with the principal lot shall continue to comply
with the minimum lot area of the district.
D.   Minimum yard requirements. The minimum distance from a tower to nearby
structures shall be equal to the height of the tower. The minimum distance from
a parcel on which a tower is proposed to school/day care center/public park/

(Ord. 2969. Passed 3-17-99.)
 
   1144.04 PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Notice. Prior to taking any action on an application, the Planning
Commission will cause notice of the pending application to be sent by certified
mail to all abutting property owners and property owners within 1,000 feet of
the parcel on which the antenna and/or tower is to be located. The Building
Inspector may also provide notice by regular first class mail to any other
property owner in the Village which he feels will be substantially impacted by
the siting of this tower. The failure of the Building Inspector to give notice
as required in this section shall not affect the validity of the Planning
Commission's action. The foregoing notice requirement may be waived by the
Planning Commission for construction of a new antenna on an existing structure
which application does not require the construction of a new tower or
associated facility.
 
   (b)    Criteria for Permitted Use. The following items must be submitted to
the Planning Commission, along with the application, as a pre-requisite for the
application to be considered for review for wireless communication facilities
to be located in a T-1 District:
(1)    Documentation demonstrating that the height of the tower is the minimum
necessary for operation.
(2)    Documentation that the tower is designed in accordance with the
standards established in the Use Regulations section of this chapter for
wireless telecommunications towers.
(3)    Documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower complies with all
state and federal laws and regulations.
(4)    A current certified survey showing existing lots and property
boundaries, streets, rights of way, servitudes, utilities, buildings and
building setbacks, surrounding streets, and important physical features on the
site, total square footage of the site and lot, permanent parcel number, and
name of subdivision, if applicable.
(5)    A soil report complying with the standards of Appendix I: Geotechnical
Investigations, ANSI/EIA 222-E, as amended, shall be submitted to the
Municipality to document and verify the design specifications of the foundation
for the tower, and anchors for the guy wires, if used.
(6)    A list of all property owners and addressees within one thousand (1,000)
feet of the proposed wireless communication facility.
(7)    A list of competitors together with their addresses so that the Village
may notify the competitors of the application in an effort to encourage co-
location.
(8)    A landscape plan of the site delineating location and dimension of
proposed planning areas, including size, type and number of trees to be
planted, curbs, fences, buffers and screening elevations of fences and
materials used.
(9)    A maintenance plan in which the owner/operator will be responsible for
the upkeep of the site.
(10)    Where the telecommunications facility is located on a property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present documentation that the owner
of the property has granted an easement for the proposed facility and that the
vehicular access is provided to the facility.
 
   (c)    Criteria for a Conditional Use. The following procedural requirements
apply to all wireless telecommunications facilities whose location would
constitute a conditional use and are in addition to any others set forth in
Chapter
1144:
(1)    A wireless facility may be permitted as a conditional use in a
commercial, industrial, light manufacturing, or motor service district. In
order to be considered for review, the applicant must prove that a newly-
constructed tower is necessary and that opportunities for co-location on an
existing tower is not feasible. Such an analysis shall include, but may not be
limited to the following procedure and submissions:
A.   Provide the Commission with a list of the location of every tower,
building, or structure that could support the antenna so as to allow it to
serve its intended function.

expanding the floor area of the permitted use or changing the use which
requires an increase in the amount of parking or a change in the site’s
circulation.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1153.03 PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE.
   Prior to preparation and submission of preliminary development plans as
required by this chapter, the developer or owner of any proposed development,
use or structure within any standard zoning district of the Village is
encouraged to arrange a preliminary conference with the Planning Commission or
its designee. The purpose of such preliminary conference is to establish a
mutual understanding of the provisions of this Code and provide an opportunity
for the developer to have clarified any questions he may have which apply to
the proposed development, use or structure.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1153.04 PURPOSE OF PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   A preliminary development plan shall be prepared by the developer or the
owner for each proposed development of one parcel or two or more contiguous
parcels, including development of the site and construction, reconstruction or
external alterations of structures and buildings located, or to be located
thereon. The principal purposes of the preliminary plan are to inform the
Planning Commission as to the concept and extent of the proposed development,
to determine and inform the developer or owner of the provisions of the code
which are applicable to planning the development of the property and its
relationship to the surroundings, to ascertain if any special development
problems are involved, and for review and recommendations by the Commission
before the developer or the owner starts the final development plan.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1153.05 PROCEDURES FOR PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Submission Requirements. A written application along with the twelve
copies of the preliminary development plan shall be submitted to the
Commissioner of Buildings. The preliminary development plan shall disclose all
uses proposed for the development, their location, extent and characteristics
and shall include, unless parts are not applicable or necessary and are waived
by the Commissioner of Buildings for certain types of projects, the following
maps, plans, design and supplementary documents:
(1)   Maps of the site showing dimensions, topography, existing trees and
landscape features, utilities, buildings to be retained on the site and the
building on adjacent lots using a section of the Village 100 foot scale map
available at cost or the equivalent;
(2)   Preliminary site development plan showing locations of proposed
buildings, driveways, walk, grading and landscape treatment, all related to the
surroundings;
(3)   Preliminary design of buildings proposed to be constructed, reconstructed
or altered as to size, use or significant change in the external appearance,
including floor plans, elevations, texture and color of materials; and
(4)   Other plans, designs and documents as may be found necessary by the
Planning Commission.
   The preliminary development plan shall be prepared by a registered architect
or engineer or by a registered professional having similar training and
experience and who the Commission finds, upon review of the preliminary plans,
has satisfactorily performed the required design and planning services. Fees
for the review of such applications and the construction permits shall be
established in the Building Code.
   (b)   Review for Completeness. The Commissioner shall review the application
and proposed plan for completeness pursuant to the submission requirements set
forth in this Section. Such application shall not be processed until the
necessary items are submitted. When the application is deemed complete by the
Commissioner of Buildings, the Commissioner of Buildings shall forward the
application to the Village Planner to determine compliance with the numerical
requirements of this Zoning Code and the Village Engineer to determine
compliance with the subdivision regulations and other engineering and service
requirements of the Village.
(1)   If, after review by the Village Planner and Village Engineer, the
application is found to be in compliance with all applicable standards, the
Commissioner of Buildings shall refer the application to the Planning
Commission for their review.
(2)   If the application is found not to be in compliance with the applicable
numerical standards, the application shall be denied by the Commissioner of
Buildings and returned to the applicant with the reasons for such denial.
   (c)   Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall evaluate the
preliminary development plan along with the aforesaid findings at it’s next
regular or special meeting and shall determine if the criteria, standards and
requirements have been applied in the proposed design and relationship of the
buildings, open spaces, driveways, landscaping and other site features so as to
produce functional and attractive buildings and site with openness and other
amenities and that the intent and purposes of the Village Plan, the Land
Planning and Zoning Code and the Improvement Code, are satisfactorily
fulfilled. The Commission shall refer the plan to the Architectural and Design
Review Board for their review of the plan, in accordance with Section
1153.08. The Commission may also refer to consultants or experts for the review
of particular aspects of the plan.
   (d)   Action by the Planning Commission. Based upon the above
determinations, the Commission shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of
the meeting when all required plans and data have been received, approve the
preliminary plans submitted, deny approval or grant approval subject to
specific conditions not included in the plans as submitted, such as, but not
limited to, improvements to the building design, yard layout, open spaces, on-
site control of access to streets or such features as fences, walls and
planting to further improve and protect the proposed and surrounding
developments. The developer or the owner shall be notified in advance of any
meeting of the Commission at which time his plan shall be considered and he may
be heard thereon.
   (e)   Preliminary Plan Approved As Final Plan. If the nature or concept of
the proposed improvement is relatively simple and uncomplicated and no further
development of plans is necessary, the Commission may consider the preliminary
plan to be satisfactory as a final plan and approve the plan for immediate
issuance of permits for improving the site and constructing the building if
otherwise in compliance with this Code and the Building Code.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
   1153.06 PROCEDURES FOR FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   Upon approval of a preliminary plan, the developer or owner may
prepare a final development plan of the site and buildings. The final plan
shall be prepared by a registered architect or engineer or by a registered
professional whom the Planning Commission finds has satisfactorily performed
the required services. The final plan shall represent the development and
detailing of the approved preliminary plan, resolving any conditions which may
have been imposed in the approval, and it shall be in accord with the
applicable requirements of this Code.
   (b)   The developer shall submit twelve copies of the final plan and
applications for construction permits to the Commissioner of Buildings. All
final development applications shall be reviewed and approved in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section
1153.05. Upon approval of the final development plan, the permits for improving
the site and constructing the buildings may be approved if otherwise in
accordance with this Code and Building Code of the Village.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
   1153.07 PLAN REVISION; LAPSE OF APPROVAL.
   The final development plan, including the plans of the building, may be
revised by the developer and resubmitted to the Planning Commission, which,
after a review by the Architectural and Design Review Board, if the Commission
so requests, and the Village Planner and Village Engineer, may authorize such
revision. Failure to begin the construction of all or a substantial portion of
the improvements approved by the final development plan within 180 days after
such approval shall render the approval void and of no effect, unless an
extension of time is allowed by the Commission.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
   1153.08 REVIEW REQUIRED BY ARCHITECTURAL AND DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.

   1155.01 INTENT.
   Use, area, yard and height regulations applying to standard zoning
residential districts are established in order to achieve, among others, the
following purposes:
(a)   To regulate the use of dwellings and the accessory uses in relation to
and compatible with the characteristics of present districts;
(b)   To regulate the density and distribution of the population in accord with
a plan for maintaining adequate municipal services;
(c)   To regulate the bulk and location of buildings so as to obtain proper
light, air, privacy and usable open space on each lot;
(d)   To protect, conserve and improve the amenities prevailing in the
neighborhood; and
(e)   To promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land in
accordance with the Village Plan.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
   1155.02 USE REGULATIONS.
   Buildings and land shall be used and buildings shall be designed, erected,
altered, moved or maintained in standard residential districts only for the
uses set forth in this chapter.
(a)   Types of Uses.
(1)   The main use shall be permitted by right in a district in which it is
specifically permitted by this Code.
(2)   An accessory use shall be permitted by right in a district in which it is
specifically permitted by this Code if it is clearly incidental, related and
accessory to the main use located on the same lot or parcel, or a special
permit therefor has been granted.
(b)   Schedule of Permitted Buildings and Uses.
(1)   Main buildings and uses: One-family detached dwellings, not more than one
per lot, municipal buildings, parks, playgrounds and publicschools.
(2)   Accessory buildings and uses:
A.   Buildings: Private garages, greenhouses, garden houses, beachhouses;
B.   Structures: Private swimming and wading pools, air conditioners,
condensers, generators, walls and fences, revetments and stairs to lake;
C.   Yard uses: Private gardens and recreation uses, parking and storage uses;
D.   Landscaping features: Hedges, shrubs;

persons employed on the premises, but without additional cooking facilities;
F.   Temporary structures for construction operations; and
G.   Storage sheds, gazebos, play equipment, or garden equipment/structures
such as statues or trellises.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
   1155.03 LOT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   In the planning of subdivisions, lots shall be designed to provide
functional building sites to fully accommodate the dwelling, yards and
accessory uses in accordance with the requirements and criteria of this
chapter. Moreover, parcels shall be subdivided, consolidated or resubdivided,
to form a coordinated neighborhood pattern as set forth in Chapter
1135. Such divisions and compliance with the design criteria shall be
determined in the review process.
   (a)    Area and Width of Lots. The area and widths of lots shall comply with
the minimum area and width requirements set forth in Section
1155.05 for the district in which the lot is located.
      (1)    In the R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 Districts, the width of a lot shall
be measured at the front building setback line. On curved streets the front lot
line may be less than the required width for the lot but the chord at the front
lot line shall be not less than sixty percent (60%) of the required width at
the building line.
      (2)    In the R-LF District, the width of the lot shall be measured at
both the front building setback line and the front lot line. However, the
standards shall be construed as minimum and not optimal standards. The Planning
Commission may, during the subdivision review process, require adjustments in
lot size and shape to achieve optimal lots that are appropriate for the
neighborhood and type of development proposed, approximating rectangular shapes
to the extent possible.
   (b)    Depth of Lots. The mean horizontal distance between the front and
rear lot lines of the lot shall not exceed two and one-half times its width at
the building setback line except where the front lot line abuts on Lake Shore
Boulevard or the rear lot line abuts the Freeway, Lake Erie or a brook, in
which case the depth of the lot may be increased but may not exceed three and
one-half times its width unless otherwise approved in the review process.
   (c)    Corner Lots. In order to achieve appropriate orientation to both
streets, corner lots shall have extra width as determined in the review process
of the subdivision or development plan.
   (d)    Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be designed to be at right
angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, excepting
such lines should be adjusted to accommodate topography, natural features or a
cluster design.
   (e)    Lot Consolidation Required. A lot that is comprised of two (2) or
more adjacent lots of record owned in common shall be consolidated whenever the
following types of new construction are proposed:
      (1)   Whenever a main building, accessory building more than 40 square
feet in area, or accessory recreational structure, is constructed or enlarged
and the area or placement of the construction is dependent on the total area
and/or dimensions of the lot in order to comply with the zoning requirements,
and would not comply based on the area and/or dimensions of the lot of record
on which the new construction is proposed.
      (2)    Whenever a main building, or part thereof, accessory building more
than forty (40) square feet in area, accessory recreational structure, or
driveway is constructed or enlarged on two or more lots of record.
      (3)    Whenever an accessory building, accessory recreational structure
or accessory parking area is proposed on a lot of record separate from the
dwelling to which the building, recreational structure or parking area is
accessory.  
(Ord. 4115. Passed 2-15-23.)
   1155.04 YARD REGULATIONS.
   Yards shall be provided for one-family dwellings, in accordance with the
schedule in Section
1155.05 in order to attain adequate light, air, privacy and usable open space
on each lot.
   (a)    Front Yards. The minimum front yard depth shall not be less than set
forth in Section
1155.05. Corner lots shall comply with the front yard setback in Section
1155.05 for each street on which the lot has frontage.
   (b)    Front Yards on Built-up Blocks. Whenever there are existing dwellings
that were lawfully constructed before this Code was passed, but which do not
comply with the setback from the street right-of-way set forth in Section
1155.05, the required front setback for additions, alterations, and new
construction shall be the average front setback of the existing, adjacent homes
on either side of the home or vacant lot on which the front setback is to be
determined.
   (c)    Side Yards. Side yard dimensions shall not be less than set forth in
Section
1155.05. Accessory structures may be located in a required side yard in
accordance with Section
1155.06.
   (d)    Rear Yards. Rear yard depth as measured from the main building wall
shall not be less than set forth in Section
1155.05. Detached accessory buildings may be located in the required rear yards
in accordance with Section
1155.06.
   (e)    Projections. Building projections that extend outside the enclosing
walls as an integral, functional and necessary part of the main building, are
encouraged to add form and interest to the exterior design. Such projections
may encroach into the required yard in compliance with the following:
      (1)    Architectural features such as chimneys, bay windows and cornices
may project from exterior walls not more than two and one-half (2 ½) feet into
a required front or side yard.
      (2)    Entrance platforms and hoods, one-story unenclosed porches,
shading devices and other open shelters, may project for a distance of ten (10)
feet into a required front or side yard but shall not project within three (3)
feet of a property line.
      (3)    Projections are not restricted in required rear yards, except as
regulated in Section
1155.05(c).
      (4)    Otherwise, every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky
and unobstructed.

Notes:
(1) See also Section
1155.05(b) for exceptions.
(2) See Section
1155.05(c).
(3) Whichever is less.
   (b)    Exceptions to Schedule
1155.05(a).
      (1)   In an R-1 District, lots fronting on the north side of Lake Shore
Boulevard shall have at least 240 feet depth but not more than as set forth in
Section
1155.03(b).
      (2)   In an R-2 District, lots fronting on the south side of Lake Shore
Boulevard shall have a front yard of at least seventy-five (75) feet and a
depth of at least 200 feet but not more than as set forth in Section
1155.03(b).
      (3)    For lots of fifty (50) feet or less in width, the minimum width of
one yard shall not be less than three (3) feet and the total of the two (2)
side yards shall not be less than ten (10) feet.
   (c)    Setback from Lake Erie Shoreline. As noted in the Bratenahl Village
Plan, the lakefront is one of the most important natural resources in the
Village. The following shoreline
setback regulations apply to lakefront lots in the RLF and R-1 Districts in
order to preserve, protect and enhance the shoreline, views of Lake Erie and
property values, and reduce the potential for damage to buildings and
structures from shoreline erosion.
      (1)    New construction and building additions along the Lake Erie
shoreline shall comply with the minimum shoreline setback determined by the
stringline setback method in subsection
1155.05(c)(2) or 150 feet, whichever is greater.
      (2)    The stringline setback shall be established by drawing a straight
line between the nearest dwelling on either side of the lot on which the
setback is to be determined, from the point where each dwelling projects the
closest to the ordinary high water mark, including attached structures (e.g.,
decks or stairs) that are thirty (30) inches in height or greater above the
existing grade, (see Figure
1155.05(c)).
      (3)    Where more than one point of a primary dwelling is equally closest
to the ordinary high water mark, the stringline shall be drawn from the point
closest to the lot on which the setback is to be determined.
      (4)    New construction of buildings and structures on lots contiguous to
the shoreline shall be compatible in scale with existing development and shall
not extend further lakeward into the minimum shoreline setback except as
permitted in Section
1155.06.
      (5)    No vegetation shall be planted, maintained, or permitted to grow
within the minimum shoreline setback in a manner that unreasonably obstructs
the existing views of the lake from any dwelling on an adjoining lot, as
specified in Section
1155.06(b)(6).
      (6)   For the purposes of this Section only, the “property line” along
the Lake shall be the point where the natural shoreline intersects the ordinary
high water elevation as determined by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Geological Survey.

   1159.01 INTENT.
   An Office, Research and Distribution District is hereby established in order
to provide land in the Village for a use which will be consistent with the
essential residential character of the Village, the maintenance of which is an
essential purpose of this Code. This district is herein referred to as the O
District.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1159.02 MAIN USES PERMITTED.
   In an O District, building and land shall be used and buildings shall be
designed, erected, altered, moved or maintained only for the following main
uses:
(a)    Office buildings for business and professional use and buildings for
storage in connection with wholesale distribution of goods and merchandise,
with offices connected therewith. Neither dead storage nor open warehousing
shall be permitted.
(b)    Laboratories for scientific and industrial research and development
including the use of scientific laboratory equipment and devices, which do not
involve the danger of injury to persons or property at a distance of 100 feet
or more. Industrial machinery is to be used only for experimental and
development work and not for manufacturing. All dust, fumes, gases, noises,
odors, refuse matter and vibrations are to be effectively confined to the
premises within the district.
(Ord. 1600. Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1159.03 ACCESSORY USES.
   Accessory uses incidental to the foregoing main uses are permitted as
follows:
(a)    Service departments, garages and parking facilities;
(b)    Railroad spurs or switch tracks, loading docks and facilities;
(c)    Auditorium, cafeterias, clinics and recreational facilities for the use
only of visitors to the buildings on the premises and employees of the occupant
of the premises, or of affiliates of such occupant, provided that such
accessory uses are planned as an integral part of the main building and
controlled under the same ownership and operation as the main use.
(Ord. 1600 Passed 7-26-62.)
 
   1159.04 SIGNS.
   (a)   Each lot shall have not more than two accessory signs. No sign shall
exceed 100 square feet in area inside its perimeter, unless a larger area is
approved by the Planning Commission as part of the development plan. Each sign
shall be designed as an integral part of the design of the building and located
below the level of the roof. The design shall be submitted with the plans of
the building and approved by the Planning Commission. No exterior spotlighting
or other illumination, as will be an annoyance to inhabitants in residential
districts, is permitted. Necessary safety lighting of roads and buildings and
necessary direction signs are permitted.
   (b)   The owner of any sign which is otherwise permitted by this Code may
substitute a non-commercial message in lieu of any other commercial or
noncommercial message. This substitution of message may be made without any
additional approval or permit. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any
inadvertent and unintended favoring of a commercial message over a
noncommercial message or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over
any other noncommercial message. This provision shall prevail over any more
specific provision to the contrary in the Village of Bratenahl Codified
Ordinances.
   (c)   In addition to the signs and messages permitted in Subsections (a) and
(b) above, a lot in the O District may construct an off-premise sign subject to
the following:
      (1)   Only one (1) off-premise sign, with a maximum of two (2) sign
faces, shall be permitted on a lot; and
      (2)   Off-premise signs shall not be attached to or located on a building
or other structure not intended or utilized for the sole purpose of supporting
said signs; and
      (3)   The maximum size of an off-premise sign shall not exceed two
hundred forty (240) square feet per sign face including the frame and border.
When two (2) sides of a sign are parallel to each other, or within thirty (30)
degrees of being parallel, the off-premise sign may have display on both
surfaces; and (Ord. 4089. Passed 3-17-21.)
      (4)   The maximum height of an off-premise sign, measured from the
elevation of I-90 perpendicular to the I-90 right-of-way directly north of the
location of the sign, shall not be greater than thirty (30) feet; and
         (Ord. 4175. Passed 1-18-23.)
      (5)   An off-premise sign shall be a minimum of five hundred (500) feet
from any other off-premise sign, measured along the nearest edge of the right-
of-way between points directly opposite the center of the signs along the same
side of the street or highway on which the sign is to be located; and
      (6)   No portion of an off-premise sign, including its related framing,
borders, and support structures, shall be located closer than fifteen (15) feet
to a public right-of-way, extend over any property line on which the off-
premise sign is erected, or be located closer to a building than a distance
equal to the height of the off-premise sign; and
      (7)   Only one (1) sign face of the off-premise sign may be internally
illuminated and such internally illuminated sign face shall face the direction
along interstate 90 that has the least impact on Village residents as
determined by the Planning Commission pursuant to the procedures in Subsection
(e) below; and
      (8)   Any off-premise sign face that is not internally illuminated may be
externally illuminated by lighting directed to the display panel and as
approved by the Planning Commission; and
      (9)   An off-premise sign and sign frame shall be supported by a monopole
or similar single, vertical structure.
   (d)   An internally illuminated off-premise sign shall:
      (1)   Have no movement of any kind occurring more frequently than once
every eight (8) seconds; and
      (2)   Have automatic dimming capability that adjusts the brightness of
the sign at any time of the day or night so it does not exceed two-tenths (0.2)
of a foot-candle above the ambient light of the area as measured one hundred
and fifty feet (150') from the face of the off-premise sign.
   (e)   Off-Premise Sign Permit. The Planning Commission shall have the
authority to review a request by an applicant for an off-premise sign pursuant
to the applicable provisions of Chapter
1153 Procedures for Development Plan Review for Standard Districts.
      (1)   In lieu of the submission requirements in Section
1153.05(a) the applicant shall submit: a site plan depicting the existing and
proposed conditions in the vicinity of the off-premise sign; elevations of the
off-premise sign; illustrations depicting the off-premise sign’s relationship
to existing development on the site of the off-premise sign and to adjacent and
nearby property; documentation as to the method of lighting the off-premise
sign including brightness, orientation of the proposed lighting, the levels and
location of light trespass; a copy of a valid conditional permit issued by the
Ohio Department of Transportation for the proposed off-premise sign in the
proposed location, and other documentation to adequately describe the proposal
in sufficient detail for the Planning Commission to determine if the proposed
off-premise sign is in compliance with this Section.
      (2)   All plans for an off-premise sign shall be certified by a licensed
engineer registered in Ohio, stating that the off-premise sign, as proposed, is
designed in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, codes, and
professional standards.
      (3)   An application for an electrical permit shall be submitted
simultaneously with an application for an illuminated off-premise sign.

permit to post a maintenance guarantee acceptable to the Village Solicitor to
insure that an abandoned, non-maintained, obsolete or destroyed sign and/or
sign structure shall be removed within six months of cessation of use and
abandonment. The amount of the guarantee shall cover 100% of the cost to
properly remove the sign and associated support structure and foundation.
   (f)   Construction, Maintenance and Removal of Signs.  
      (1)   All off-premise signs, sign structures, sign foundation and methods
to attach and anchor signs shall be constructed in accordance with industry-
wide standards established by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America
and the Institute of Outdoor Advertising, or their successor organizations, and
applicable provisions of this Village of Bratenahl Building Code.
      (2)   All off-premises signs and sign structures shall be structurally
sound and maintained in a safe and attractive condition. Off-premise signs and
sign structures shall be repaired and painted as often as necessary to prevent
rusting, peeling paint and undue fading. Any damage to the structural
components shall be repaired within 24 hours. Off-premise signs that have been
abandoned or are not maintained in accordance with this section or other
applicable regulations of the Village shall be removed by the last permit
holder or property owner, or by the Village at the expense of such permit
holder or property owner.
      (3)   The sign owner shall securely attach the ODOT-issued sign permit
plate(s) so as to be visible from the main, traveled way.
      (4)   Whenever the sign permit holder is required to submit a renewal
application to ODOT, the owner shall submit a copy of the approved renewal to
the Village Building Department within 30 days of its issuance.
      (5)   Whenever the removal or maintenance of an off-premise sign has been
ordered by the Commissioner of Buildings, the permit holder or the owner of

forty-eight (48) hours after receiving such notice. In the event of
noncompliance, the Commissioner may remove or cause to be removed or maintained

the sign is erected. The funds of the maintenance guarantee shall be used to
make such maintenance, repairs or replacements, and the Village may make a
claim against the maintenance guarantee surety.
      (6)   Removal of a sign shall include the sign, enclosing frame, all sign
supporting members and base.
   (g)   Billboards, as defined in the Bratenahl Planning and Zoning Code, are

district in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter
1153. Such plan and any amendments thereof shall be in conformity with the
following standards:
(a)    Sites shall be at least five acres in area, but the entire site need not
be developed at the time. A site of less than five acres may be recommended by
the Planning Commission for approval, as a variance, by the Board of Zoning

   1161.01 INTENT.
   The Village Plan recognizes that the principal development of the Village
should be residential in nature. However, certain very limited areas of the
Village, by reason of location, nearby land uses and the need for shopping for
the convenience of residents of the community, are suitable for limited, small-
scale neighborhood retail establishments and office uses. Therefore, the
Neighborhood Commercial District (NC) is established to allow businesses that
provide goods and services primarily for the convenience of individual
consumers without exposing such areas to the potential for general commercial
activity that would be detrimental to the existing and surrounding residential
neighborhoods and the Village.
(Ord. 4226. Passed 12-18-24.)
 
   1161.02 USE REGULATIONS.

fastened or suspended in any other fashion.
      (2)    Such signs shall not be attached to nor project from the roof of
the building.
      (3)    No portion of any such attached sign shall project more than
sixteen (16) inches from any wall to which the sign is attached or forms an

twelve (12) square feet and shall be limited to a maximum height of fourteen
(14) feet and a minimum clearance of eight (8) feet from the ground to the
bottom of the sign, except when the projecting sign is located above a
landscaped area or other area that does not permit pedestrian traffic beneath

      (1)    The total surface area of all such attached signs, whether
announcing the name of the building or any uses therein, shall be limited to

which the sign is erected shall remove or maintain the sign within forty-eight
(48) hours after receiving such notice. In the event of noncompliance, the
Commissioner may remove or cause to be removed or maintained such sign at the
expense of the permit holder or the owner of property on which the sign is

and approved by the Planning Commission and the Architectural and Design Review
Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter
1153.
   (d)    Additional Requirements for Conditional Uses. Because of their nature
and special characteristics, townhouses and multi-family dwellings are
regulated as conditional uses and shall be permitted only if certain conditions
are met and when such uses are designed to complement and enhance the
surrounding neighborhood.
      (1)   An applicant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that
the townhouse development or multi-family development will be compatible with
the surrounding area, including but not limited to the traffic circulation,
parking, and appearance of the development.

      (4)    In approving a proposed conditional use, the Planning Commission
may attach additional conditions and limitations concerning use, construction,
character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the
purposes and objectives of this Planning and Zoning Code, as may be appropriate

existing development in the NC district.
      (5)    If the Planning Commission approves the conditional use, it shall
be referred to Village Council for consideration and final approval.
         (Ord. 4226. Passed 12-18-24.)

   1162.01 INTENT.
   (a)   A primary objective of the Village is to encourage new, high-quality
residential development at selected locations, as defined in the Village Plan,
which is sensitive to the unique character and potential of the Village. Toward
achieving this objective, the Village has, in adopting the Village Plan,
clearly identified those locations where planned development is to be
encouraged, and indicated the basic scale of development appropriate to these
locations.
 
   (b)    The purpose of the Planned Development District is to:
(1)   Encourage unique and outstanding design that can respond to the type of
market most likely to be economically successful in the Village;
(2)    Achieve development which is consistent with the scale and character of
the Village; and
(3)   Preserve and utilize topography and other natural site features and
natural resources to both protect the natural environment and enhance the
beauty of the landscape.
 
   (c)   The Planned Development Districts offer opportunities for design,
innovation, for combining a variety of housing types into a single development,
and the opportunity for creating unique high-quality residential environments.
Therefore, this chapter sets forth zoning standards and land planning and
design criteria, supplementary to those applicable in the standard zoning
districts established by this Code, under which a developer may prepare
development plans particularly designed to meet and solve the unusual and
unique opportunities and conditions which exist in the Planned Development
Districts, as defined and designated by the Zone Plan or Map adopted as part of
this Code.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1162.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   Planned Residential Development Districts are established by this Code and
are defined on the Village Zone Plan or Map adopted as part of this Code. Upon
application and submission of plans and approval by the Planning Commission and
Council, in compliance with the procedures set forth in Chapter
1164, development plans may be approved and occupancy and building permits
issued for parcels within these designated Planned Residential Development
Districts in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1162.03 LAND LOCATED IN BOTH STANDARD RESIDENTIAL AND PLANNED RESIDENTIAL
DISTRICTS.
   As disclosed by the Zone Plan or Map, structures and land located in one or
more Standard Residential Districts may also be located in a Planned
Residential Development District (PRD). Where any land or structure is located
both in a Standard Residential District and in a PRD District, all provisions
of this Code applicable in such standard residential district shall apply to
such land and any structure thereon except during such time as a preliminary
plan or final plan of a development area which includes such land has been
approved and is in force and effect. During such time as an approved
preliminary or final plan is in force and effect, all provisions of this Code
applicable in such PRD District shall also apply to such land and any structure
thereon provided that, during such time, any provision of this Code applicable
in the PRD District shall prevail and take precedence over any conflicting
provisions of this Code applicable in the Standard Residential District.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1162.04 USES PERMITTED.
   Because a primary purpose of the Planned Residential Development District is
to encourage innovative and high-quality design, which shall preserve and
enhance the unique residential environment of the Village, all types of
dwellings as set forth in subsection (a) below are permitted in the Planned
Residential Development District.
(a)   Principal Uses in a PRD District. One-family detached dwellings,
developed on subdivided lots or in a flexible arrangement on the site in
compliance with this Chapter.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
(b)   Permitted Accessory Uses in the PRD District.
(1)   Gardens, fences, walls, ornamental pools, patios and other landscaping
features.
(2)   In-ground swimming pools, tennis courts and related terraces, sitting
areas and landscaped areas for the private recreational use of residents within
the District.
(3)   Private garages and storage garages as required by this chapter for the
private use of residents within the District.
(4)   Private ways and open guest parking areas to provide access to and serve
the residential units within the District.
(5)   Facilities for the disposal and removal of rubbish, trash and garbage in
compliance with the provisions of this and all other applicable regulations.
(6)   Enclosed facilities for the storage of building and grounds maintenance
equipment and supplies which shall be integrated into the overall design and
plan for the development.
(7)   Other facilities and areas for the exclusive use of, and operated
specifically for, residents of the development may be included with the
approval of the Planning Commission and Council; such as separate storage
areas, vehicle service facilities, meeting, social or club room facilities and
similar uses.
(c)   Conditional Accessory Uses in the PRD District. Within the PRD District,
the Planning Commission and Council may approve as elements within a specific
planned residential development area certain conditional accessory uses which
because of their unique nature and special characteristics are not permitted by
right. Such uses may be permitted if certain conditions are met, if such uses
are planned as an integral part of a planned residential development area, and
if such uses are designed to complement and enhance the principal residential
uses and the surrounding community. The following accessory uses may be
approved as part of a development plan for a planned residential development
area, pursuant to Chapter
1164 of this Code, provided that they meet the conditions enumerated hereunder
and are deemed by the Planning Commission and Council to complement and enhance
the principal residential uses of the planned residential development area, and
the surrounding community and will not adversely affect the objectives of this
chapter.
(Ord. 2677. Passed 1-20-93.)
(1)   Private boat basin facility. A private boat basin facility provided that:
A.   The facility is operated as a non-profit private organization, association

shall also provide for ongoing site inspections, at the developer’s expense,
throughout the construction period. The Village’s engineer shall be required to
provide a final approval for the entire facility, including any breakwall,
prior to its use.
L.   Once construction of the boat basin or breakwall commences and in order to
ensure and guarantee the developer’s performance, the developer shall be
required to file with the Village financial guarantees, in the form of a
performance bond, letter of credit, funds or other surety approved by the
Solicitor, in an amount equal to the Village engineer’s estimate of the total
cost of material and labor required to construct the facility. Upon the Village
engineer’s recommendation, such guarantee shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the estimated cost of the completed portion.
M.   Upon completion of the facility and prior to its use, the owner shall
obtain a special permit from the Village which provides:
1.   The dock number(s) and size(s);
2.   The names and addresses of all owners/lessors; and
3.   Copies of all inspection reports made by any governmental body relating to
the facility for the preceding twelve months.
   Thereafter, all facilities shall be required to renew their special permit
every twelve months for the facility’s continued operation. Failure to provide
the required information shall result in the revocation of a facility’s special
permit.

limited lodging facilities, provided that:
A.   The facility shall be operated as a private nonprofit facility for the
benefit of the members.
B.   Membership shall be open to all residents of the planned residential
development area, but a substantial number of the dwelling unit owners within
the planned residential development area shall automatically be members, such
number to be determined by the Planning Commission based on the size of the
planned residential development area, the size of the proposed club and other
pertinent considerations. These dwelling units which carry automatic membership
shall be designated on the planned residential development plan by the
developer, and shall be approved by the Planning Commission. Not less than one-
fourth of the total membership of the club, both initially and on a continuing
basis, must be owners of dwelling units within the planned residential
development area or docks or slips.
C.   No retail sales or services to the general public shall be permitted.
D.   The size and location of club parking lots and required set backs shall be
determined by the Planning Commission in accordance with acceptable industry
standards as recommended by the Village Planner.
E.   Access into the facility shall be controlled and limited to members and
their guests. Access to the facility shall be by a separate street or private
way which shall not be an integral part of an access way to residential
dwellings.
F.   Lodging facilities shall be only for overnight or limited occupancy as
guests of a member of the club and not on a commercial basis. Lodging
facilities shall not include cooking facilities of any type.
G.   Outdoor dining terraces, swimming pools, tennis courts and similar
facilities are permitted and shall comply with all applicable provisions and
requirements of this chapter.
H.   Adequate parking space shall be provided as determined by the Planning
Commission and Council.
I.   No signs other than an identity sign and directional graphics shall be
permitted.
J.   Final development plans shall include a detailed statement of the form of
ownership, of the private club, requirements for membership and operating
agreements. All final development plans shall be subject to the approval of the

3.   Copies of all inspection reports made by any governmental body relating to
the facility for the preceding twelve months.
   Thereafter, all facilities shall be required to renew their special permit
every twelve months for such facility’s continued operation. Failure to provide
the required information shall result in the revocation of a facility’s special
permit.
   The Planning Commission and Council may impose such additional conditions to
the approval of a conditional accessory use as they deem necessary to assure
that the facilities are operated as an accessory facility to the overall
planned residential development area in which it is located, and not as a
principal use, and they shall also apply this standard in making the
determinations set forth herein.
(Ord. 2677. Passed 1-20-93.)
 
   1162.05 AREA, HEIGHT AND GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   The standards, criteria and requirements set forth in this section are
intended as minimums for development in planned residential development areas
to provide protection and assurance to surrounding development and to prevent
development which is incompatible, undesirable and unsuccessful within the
Village.
   The various area, height and site planning standards, criteria and
requirements are as follows:
(a)   Minimum Development Area. Sites which are the subject of the individual
applications for development plan approval under the provisions of this chapter
shall be comprised of a single parcel or a group of contiguous parcels for
which the applicant has secured written authorization from the owner(s) of
record to make such application and which shall contain in the aggregate not
less than 5 acres when such group of contiguous parcels are consolidated into
one. Development plans for sites containing less than the required minimum land
area may be submitted under the provisions of this chapter as additions to a
large planned residential development areas then in force, provided such
additions are contiguous to such previously approved areas and are integrated
into an overall preliminary and final development plan for the total combined
sites and otherwise are in accordance with all other requirements of this
chapter.
(b)   The maximum density shall not exceed 1.5 dwelling units per acre. Within
an individual planned residential development area the dwelling units need not
be distributed evenly, however, the total number of units shall not exceed the
product of the total number of acres of land multiplied by the permitted
density.
(c)   Land Coverage. Land coverage means the total land area within a planned
residential development area that is occupied or covered by structures,
including dwellings, garages, storage buildings and surface parking areas, but
not including terraces, walls, pools, walks and similar landscaping or outdoor
recreational areas, internal circulation and access drives, public rights-of-
way, and utility easements and not including the area of any structure which
extends less than three feet above average finished grade and which is
developed as a terrace, pool or similar landscaped outdoor area. For a PRD
area, land coverage shall not exceed twenty- two percent (22%) of the total
site area. In additional, total land coverage for a PRD area, including
terraces, walls, pools and other amenities excluded from the definition of land
coverage shall not exceed forty percent (40%).
(d)   Dwelling Unit Floor Area. Floor area means the sum of the area of the
several floors of a dwelling unit as measured from the interior faces of the
perimeter walls of such dwelling unit. However, there shall be excluded from
the floor area any portion of a floor having a ceiling height of not more than
four feet six inches, any basement or attic not designed or finished or
intended for normal living purposes, and any relatively open portion of the
building exterior such as balconies, porches or terraces. The required minimum
floor areas for each dwelling unit shall not be less than 1,800 square feet.
The average floor area for all dwelling units shall not be less than 2,000
square feet.
(e)   Parking Requirements. Not less than two parking spaces shall be provided
for each dwelling unit within a planned residential development area. All such
spaces shall be within a totally enclosed private garage attached to the
dwelling unit, which shall consist of not less than 440 square feet, exclusive
of necessary access drives or circulation aisles. In addition, one parking
space for each two dwelling units shall be provided as guest or visiting
parking. Such guest or visitor parking spaces may be open, enclosed or
partially enclosed, and each space shall contain not less than 200 square feet,
exclusive of access drives or circulation aisles.
(f)   Required Building Setbacks. All principal and accessory building
structures in minimum distance set forth in the following schedule:
 
                                                  Minimum Distance (feet)
(1) From any street line abutting
    Lake Shore Blvd.                                                   75
(2) From any other street line                                         50
    From any property line adjoining a district zoned exclusively as a
(3) Standard One-family Residential District
                                                                       50
    From any property line adjoining an existing or potential planned
(4) residential development area
                                                                       40
(5) From a private drive serving 40 or more units
                                                                       35
(g)   Building Height. The height of any building or structure containing a
permitted principal use within a PRD area shall not exceed three stories or
thirty-five feet in height. The height of any accessory building shall not
exceed fifteen feet.
(h)   Open Space Requirements. One of the purposes of the PRD regulations is to
permit design flexibility to preserve the Village’s natural features and
significant open space areas. To achieve this objective:
(1)   All PRDs shall be designed and arranged so that all dwelling units and
access drives are located to preserve: natural areas, streams, creeks, and
natural drainage, wooded areas, large trees, and views to natural areas and the
lake to the maximum extent possible; and
(2)   The preservation of both natural features and open space areas shall
result in a consolidated land area, or series of areas, which in the aggregate,
represent a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the project’s development area.
Land fragments between buildings, between buildings and drives, between
buildings and adjacent property lines, and otherwise unbuildable fragments
shall not be considered as satisfying this minimum open space requirement.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)
 
   1162.06 LAND PLANNING AND DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Purpose and Objectives. The Village recognizes that skillful and high-
quality design and arrangement of buildings, structures and outdoor areas is an
important factor in the development of residential areas and in the maintenance
and protection of the health, safety, general welfare and property values
throughout the community. In establishing the land planning and design
criteria, guidelines and requirements, it is he purpose and intent of the
Village to achieve the following basic objectives in the planning and design of
planned residential development areas:
(1)   Preservation of the unique residential character along Lake Shore
Boulevard in terms of privacy from any street and spacious internal landscaped
grounds.
(2)   Insurance of public safety including vehicular and pedestrian traffic and
accessibility of dwelling units for emergency services.
(3)   Creation of appropriate settings, incentive for innovative and
outstanding architectural design, integrated with land planning for the site.
(4)   Preservation of the existing character and unique views in the Village
including the visual character of the community in terms of scale,
architectural design and landscaping.
(5)   Protection and maintenance of the shoreline of Lake Erie.
(6)   Protection and maintenance of light, air and views for neighboring
property.
 
   (b)   Access to Site. Vehicular access to PRD sites shall be located and
designed specifically to:
(1)   Provide a safe entrance and egress from the site with adequate visibility
and sight distances and respect for existing intersections and driveways;
(2)   Preserve, insofar as practicable, existing walls, gates, landscaping and
other features;
(3)   Permit access by fire protection and other emergency vehicles and normal
service vehicles; and
(4)   Prevent through traffic.
   Any street or private way shall be located not less then twenty feet from
any adjoining property line at the intersection with the street line and such
intersection shall be at ninety degrees as nearly as practicable.
   Streets or private ways shall be developed in accordance with Chapters
1135 and
1137 and shall be paved to a width of not less than twenty-five feet for a
distance of not less than seventy-five feet from the street property line.
Streets or private ways may be divided with a landscaped median to separate
entering and exiting traffic. Such median shall be not less than eight nor more
than twenty feet in width and each roadway shall be paved to a width of not
less than twenty-one feet.
   If a street or private way serves more than 40 PRD units or if a conditional
accessory use requires more than 60 parking spaces, the minimum width of the
separate street or private way thereto shall be 25 feet. If access to the site
is to be controlled by a private security guard, facilities for control shall
be located so as to be visible from the street and to prevent obstruction of
traffic in the street by automobile awaiting access.
 
   (c)   Internal Circulation. Internal circulation may be by a street or
private way. Such street or private way shall be located to provide adequate
access to all units and parking areas for safety and convenience purposes, to
minimize intrusion upon the views and landscaped areas of the site, and to
minimize impact upon adjoining properties, and shall be located not less than
twenty feet from any property line and be adequately screened and buffered with
landscaped areas from such adjoining property and shall be located not less
than twenty feet from any principal building, except for direct access into
enclosed parking facilities or convenient “drop-offs” at building entrances.
   Such streets or private ways shall be established by dedication or by
recorded private easements, declarations or covenants, which shall conform to
the requirements of Chapters
1135 and
1137.
   Internal pedestrian circulation shall be provided by an internal walkway
system
which shall provide safe pedestrian access between each dwelling unit and Lake
Erie, where applicable, and between each dwelling unit and required resident
and guest parking areas, and such common facilities as swimming pools or tennis
courts and other major accessory uses as the Planning Commission may decide.
   Such walkways shall be integrated with the landscaping for the site and with
the
arrangement of buildings to assure safe and convenient access and to prevent
unnecessary conflict between common walkways and areas and the privacy of
individual units.
 
   (d)   Parking Area and Facilities.
(1)   Entrances to garages shall be located and designed so as not to interfere
with the safe movement of traffic into and within the site and should be
located and screened to minimize their visibility from the street and
surrounding properties and from the principal views of dwelling units within
the site.
(2)   Required additional parking for guest and visitor use located in open
parking areas shall be located not less than seventy-five (75) feet from any
property line abutting Lake Shore Boulevard and not less than twenty-five (25)
feet from any other property line. If such additional guest and visitor parking
is provided within partially enclosed or enclosed garages, such parking shall
be located in compliance with all appropriate regulations in this chapter
governing accessory structures and parking garages.
(3)   All guest and visitor parking provided in open areas shall be paved in
accordance with specifications approved by the Village Engineer and shall be
maintained free from dust, paper, other loose particles, snow and ice. The
design and arrangement of such parking spaces shall not interrupt or conflict
with the normal movement of vehicles on the site or restrict access to any
other required parking areas or facilities on the site. Guest and visitor
parking areas shall be distributed throughout the site and at least the
required number of such additional spaces shall be located within 250 feet of
the principal entrance of a dwelling unit or dwelling structure.
 
   (e)   Provision for Services and Service Facilities.
(1)   Within any planned residential development area, appropriate facilities
for the private disposal of trash, garbage and rubbish shall be provided.
(2)   The developer shall demonstrate that the proposed development plan has
made adequate provisions for access by delivery and service vehicles, trash,
garbage and rubbish removal vehicles, and emergency service vehicles to all
dwellings in compliance with the provisions of Chapters
1135 and
1137 and all other applicable regulations.
(3)   All utility services, including, but not limited to, electric, telephone
and television cable, shall be installed underground throughout the entire
development.
(4)   Any necessary above-ground service, storage or utility facilities shall
be completely screened with decorative walls and/or landscaping from the
surrounding area and shall comply with all requirements for accessory
structures.
 
   (f)   Building Arrangement and Spacing. The criteria for building spacing
arrangement set forth in this section are intended to provide considerable
latitude and flexibility to encourage variety, innovation and high quality in
the design and arrangement of buildings and landscape features.
   Developers in planned residential development areas are encouraged to
cluster buildings and structures to provide for efficiency of accessibility and
service, to provide variety in the size and character of outdoor spaces and
areas, and to preserve large open grounds which are characteristic of
traditional development in the Village. The site and architectural design shall
provide for the privacy of each dwelling unit.
   All dwellings units shall be provided with adequate light and air, means of
egress and separations for fire protection, as required by the Village Building
Code and the Ohio Basic Building Code.
   The minimum distance between any two units in a planned residential
development area shall be:
(1)   A minimum of forty feet between facing walls with living space less than
sixty feet in length or between facing walls which have an overlapping portion
less than sixty feet in length.
(2)    A minimum of twenty-five feet when a wall with living space faces a
garage.
(3)   A minimum of twenty-five feet between garages.

   1164.02 PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE.
   Prior to the preparation and submission of preliminary development plans as
required by this chapter, the developer or owner of any property within areas
designated as PRD on the Village Zone Plan or Map is encouraged to arrange a
preliminary conference with the Planning Commission or it’s designee. The
purpose of such preliminary conference is to establish a mutual understanding
of the provisions of this Code, the development objectives of the Village as
expressed through the Village Plan and Zoning Code, and to provide an
opportunity for the developer to have clarified any questions he may have
concerning the requirements of the Code in general, and specifically those
provisions which apply to the proposed PRD area. Such preliminary conference is
encouraged but not required.
(Ord. 3051. Passed 1-17-01.)

(j)   The Commission may require additional drawings to supplement the above
where more information is needed or special conditions occur.
(k)   In the event the approved preliminary plan included the phasing of
development, the final plan shall designate appropriate boundaries for the
proposed initial phase. All of the submittals required by subsections (a)
through (j) hereof shall nevertheless be required for the entire development
area to permit evaluation of the development as a whole, except that the
requirements for detailed architectural, landscaping and certain improvement
plans and specifications, and the requirement of disclosing sources and
commitments for financing, may be waived for areas other than that designated
within the boundaries of the initial phase.
Required submittals that have been waived for subsequent phases shall be

development and construction of any such subsequent phase within an approved
final plan of a planned development area.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1164.10 CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL.
   (a)   If the Planning Commission, after public hearing, finds that a
proposed final plan of a development area is in accordance with and represents
a detailed and precise expansion of the preliminary plan heretofore approved by
Council, that it is in accordance with the design criteria and provisions of
this Code which apply particularly to a final plan of a development area, and
that it complies with all the conditions which may have been imposed in the
approval of the preliminary plan, the Commission shall approve such final plan
of the development area and, upon approval by Council, the final plan will be
certified as approved to the Village Clerk.
 
   (b)   Before giving its final approval to any final plan of a development
area, the Commission may request such changes as it deems necessary to insure
that the proposed development preserves and extends the charm and beauty
existent in and inherent to the residential character of the Village; to
stabilize and improve property values, with the least possible burden on
Village services and facilities, which shall result in the highest possible
return to the Village from tax revenues consistent with maintaining and
improving the residential character of the Village, and to provide the best
economical and social advantages which can result from an orderly planned use
of the development area.
(Ord. 2813. Passed 11-29-85.)
 
   1164.11 BUILDING PERMITS.
   A building permit may be issued for the improvement of any parcel or portion
thereof, in a District designated as PRD, if and when a final plan of a
development area in a PRD District, or any phase in a final plan of a
development area in such District has been approved. Upon such approval the
Commissioner of Buildings shall be so notified and he may then issue the
necessary building and other permits upon payment of the required fees.
(Ord. 2680. Passed 1-20-93.)
 
   1164.12 CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS; LAPSE OF FINAL PLAN APPROVAL.
   The developer shall use due diligence to proceed with and complete the
construction of the development area or any approved phase thereof. Failure by
the developer to begin substantial above ground construction in accordance with
the approved final plan of the development area or any approved phase thereof
within one year after approval by the Planning Commission, or discontinuance of
such construction for a period of one year, shall cause the approval of the
final plan of the development area to lapse.
   For approved phased developments, failure by the developer to begin
substantial above ground construction on a subsequent phase within three years
after the substantial completion of construction on any earlier approved phase
shall cause the approval of the final plan of the development area to lapse.
   The Planning Commission, for good cause shown, may extend any approval which
would otherwise lapse under the provisions of this section for one or more
successive periods not to exceed one year each.
   If a final development plan lapses under the provisions of this section, the
Chairman of the Commission shall remove the planned residential development
area notation from the Zone Plan or Map and shall send notice by certified mail
of such action to the owner or developer. Failure of delivery of such mail
notice shall not invalidate such proceedings. The zoning regulations applicable
before the development was approved shall then be in effect.
(Ord. 2242. Passed 7-13-81.)
 
   1164.13 AMENDMENTS TO PLANS.
   At any time after the approval of a preliminary plan or a final plan of a
development area, if the owner or owners of the land within such approved
planned residential area desire to change such plan, they may do so only if an
amendment to the plan is requested and approved. The procedure for requesting
and approving amendments shall be as follows:
(a)   If the amendment deals with the preliminary plan, the request for an
amendment shall be filed with Council and acted upon by it.
(b)   If the amendment deals only with a final plan of a development area, it
shall be filed with the Planning Commission and a copy filed with the Village
Clerk.
   The proposed amendment shall then be subject to the same procedure and
conditions of approval as the original application.

procedures set forth in Section
1164.14(c). The Planning Commission shall make the final determination that the
proposed design is in compliance with the approved development plan.
 
   (b)   Any minor additions or alterations proposed to an existing dwelling
unit within an approved planned residential development area that do not

   1315.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Bratenahl, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Bratenahl has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Bratenahl as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Bratenahl.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas effective August 15, 2019 Flood Insurance Study for Cuyahoga County, Ohio
and Incorporated Areas effective August 15, 2019.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authorized by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Bratenahl as required by Section
1315.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Bratenahl Village Hall, 411 Bratenahl Road,
Bratenahl, OH.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Bratenahl, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 4039.
Passed 7-17-19.)
   1315.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the
principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any
provision of these
regulations or a request for a variance.

year. The base flood may also be referred to as the one percent (1%) chance
annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   1.    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   2.    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually areas of ponding); base
flood elevations are determined.
   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than
one (1) square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   Zone V
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year flood from velocity
hazard (wave action); base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zone VE and V1-30
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year from velocity hazard
(wave action); base flood elevations are determined.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one
[1] foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have
been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is
typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis
such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base
flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall the
designated height be more than one (1) foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain
management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that
could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a
selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed
bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization
in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   3.    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   4.    Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
Bratenahl’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)
A line shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map to indicate the inland limit of the
one and one-half foot (1.5-ft ) breaking wave height during the base flood.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the lowest floor” which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is
designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a
"recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured
home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Moderate Wave Action Area (MoWA)
A special flood hazard area subject to the potential for breaking wave heights
of greater than or equal to one and a half (1.5) feet, but less than three (3)
feet, where the primary source of flooding is storm surges, seiches. A MoWA is
an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is between the inland limit of zone VE
and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where identified. (Also known as “Coastal
A Zone”).
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by Bratenahl and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
“start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [June 15, 1981], and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code §111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s department, or any
court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-
propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30,
A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the ‘before damaged’ condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   1.    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   2.    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.
(Ord. 4039. Passed 7-17-19.)

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Bratenahl,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Bratenahl have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Bratenahl’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Bratenahl boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Bratenahl suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Bratenahl has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1315.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, and V1-30:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1315.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or V1-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures
include issuing press releases, public service announcements, and other public
information materials related to the floodplain development permits and repair
of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal, state, and local
agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of
damaged structures materials and other information related to the proper repair
of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of Compliance insurance
claims. (Ord. 4039. Passed 7-17-19.)

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Bratenahl specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1315.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

flood protection elevation, and
         B.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects
of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.
            1.   Water loading values shall be those associated with the base
flood.
            2.   Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-13 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or current version adopted by Ohio
Board of Building Standards.
            3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
subsection (j)(1)A. and B.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other

appointed to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by
Village Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at Bratenahl
Village Hall, 411 Bratenahl Road, Bratenahl, OH.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) of these
regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty (20) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All application for a variance shall be accompanied by a Variance
Application Fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by the Village of
Bratenahl.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 2506. (Ord. 4039. Passed 7-17-19.)
   1315.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1315.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that

            (Ord. 3907. Passed 1-18-17.)
   1316.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the owner must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. The approved plan must be implemented until the
site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent to the site of soil-
disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion and sediment run-off
and damage, including, but not limited to, private properties, natural and
artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   NON-STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION MEASURES: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible, e.g. stream crossings
for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation and
restoration. Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment removal
and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   EROSION CONTROL PRACTICES: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Owners shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   RUNOFF CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   SEDIMENT CONTROL PRACTICES. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site. All sediment control practices must be
capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion
dikes or channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless
used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices
must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds.
         A.   A sediment settling pond, or equivalent SCM upon approval from
the Village Engineer, is required for any one of the following conditions:
            1.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
            2.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3), inlet protection, or other sediment barriers.
            3.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
            4.   Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a
sediment trap or sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater
and Land Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a
sediment trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage
areas of 5 acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent
SCM may be utilized upon approval from the Village.
         B.   The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage
zone and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least
1,800 cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping SCMs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
         C.   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by
one of the following methods:
            1.   Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be
1000 ft3 per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
            2.   Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the
volume necessary to store the sediment as calculated with Revised Universal
Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) or other generally accepted erosion prediction model
as per the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two
units of length for each one unit of width 2:1 length-to-width ratio; however,
a length to width ration of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from
the sediment-settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage
zone has been completely filled by sediment accumulations. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the owner must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where
intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend
the size of the permissible drainage area.

0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
 
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village, but their use shall not exceed the limitations
indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment SCMs, such as boxed inlet
protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water entering active
storm drain systems. The maximum contributing drainage area shall not exceed
one (1) acre. Straw or hay bales and filter socks around catch basins are not
acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Stormwater control
measures must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These stormwater control measures must include, but
are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the Village Engineer may require additional
stormwater control measures to control off site tracking and dust. These
additional SCMs may include:
         C.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         D.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, a sediment-settling pond,
or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section 1316.09 (G) of
this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash vehicles.
         E.   Owners shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection.  Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be
provided around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is
infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the
SWP3 shall comply with the stabilization requirements in
1316.09.B.1 for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian setbacks if
applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and, unless
infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the owner is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be addressed in the
SWP3:
         A.   All SCMs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   Structural SCMs shall be designated and implemented on site to
protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resources
or wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         G.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from SCMs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         H.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls.  If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the owner
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   NON-SEDIMENT POLLUTANT CONTROLS: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The owner must
implement site SCMs to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other
debris from entering water resources, wetlands or the MS4. These SCMs shall
include but are not limited to the following:
       1.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      2.   Wastewater:  Contaminated washout from stucco, paint, form release
oils, curing compounds, and other construction materials shall not be
discharged directly into a water resource or storm sewer.
      3.   Vehicle fluids:  No pollutants from vehicle fuel, oils, or other
vehicle fluids can be discharged to surface waters of the State.
      4.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility, or natural resource or water of
the state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      5.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and cleanout
of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other construction
materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or
waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or solvents used in
vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If generated, these
wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      6.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 Plan shall contain spill prevention and response procedures
and these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      7.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      8.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff:  Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent stormwater from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Owners may also
reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (f)   COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning.
   (g)   TRENCH AND GROUND WATER CONTROL. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   INTERNAL INSPECTIONS. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven (7) calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Village Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      1.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      2.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      3.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the Village prior to October 1, in
order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in
the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
The owner shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the SCMs are functional and to evaluate whether the
SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are required.
Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in
the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls. Certified
inspection reports for full SWP3 shall be submitted to the Village Engineer
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The owner shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the Village or an alternate form
acceptable to the Village Engineer. The inspection form shall include:
         A.   The inspection date.
         B.   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of inspection.
         E.   Locations of:
            1.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.   SCMs that need to be maintained.
            3.   SCMs that failed to operate as designed or proved inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.   Where additional SCMs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
   (i)   MAINTENANCE. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All SCMs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment SCMs must be maintained in a functional condition until all up slope
areas they control reach final stabilization. The owner shall provide a
description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of SCMs and shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding
to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control SCMs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When SCMs require repair or maintenance. If an internal inspection
reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the exception of a
sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within three (3) days
of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or maintained
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)   When SCMs fail to provide their intended function. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM fails to perform its intended function as
detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more Appropriate SCM is required, the
SWP3 must be amended and the new SCM must be installed within three (3) to ten
(10) days of the inspection as determined by the Village Engineer or his/her
designated site inspector.
      (3)   When SCMs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an internal
inspection reveals that a SCM has not been implemented in accordance with the
schedule, the SCM must be implemented within ten (10) days from the date of the
inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned SCM is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the SCM is
not needed.
   (j)   FINAL STABLIZATION. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
Village Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
owner may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement applies
to that portion of the site. Final stabilization also requires the installation
of permanent (post-construction) stormwater control measures (SCMs).
Obligations under this ordinance shall not be completed until installation of
post-construction SCMs is verified.
   (k)   DISPOSITION OF TEMPORARY PRACTICES. All temporary and permanent
erosion and sediment SCM shall be disposed of within thirty days after final
site stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise authorized by the City Engineering Department. Trapped
sediment shall be permanently stabilized or removed to prevent further erosion.

      (5)   Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment SCMs such as boxed inlet
protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water entering active
storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay bales, and filter
socks around an inlet are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the Village shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in
1316.09 of these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24
hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When SCMs require repair or maintenance.  If the internal
inspection reveals that a SCM is in need of repair or maintenance, with the

   1317.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Bratenahl:
 
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Bratenahl to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
stormwater control measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Bratenahl's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
 
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1317.01.
 
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Bratenahl shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
 
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
 
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1316 Erosion and Sediment Control.
 
   (g)   This regulation does not apply to construction or re-construction of
stand-alone single family dwellings when the parcel is not part of an overall
subdivision or is part of a subdivision that is in existence as of the adoption
of this ordinance, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer. (Ord.
3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this regulation, the following terms shall have the
meaning herein indicated:
   (a)   ACRE: A measurement of area equaling 43,560 square feet.
   (b)   AS-BUILT SURVEY: A survey shown on a plan or drawing prepared by a
Registered Professional Surveyor indicating the actual dimensions, elevations,
and locations of any structures, underground utilities, swales, detention

It is preferred that the entire site be shown on one plan sheet to allow a
complete view of the site during plan review. If a smaller scale is used to
accomplish this, separate sheets providing an enlarged view of areas on
individual sheets should also be provided.
      (10)   An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Inspection and
Maintenance Agreement required for SCMs under this regulation shall be a stand
alone document between the Village and the owner and shall contain the
following information and provisions:
         A.   The location of each SCM, including those SCMs permitted to be
located in, or within 50 feet of, water resources, and identification of the
drainage area served by each SCM.
         B.   A schedule for regular maintenance for each aspect of the
stormwater management system and description of routine and non-routine
maintenance tasks to ensure continued performance of the system as is detailed
in the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. This schedule may
include additional standards, as required by the Village Engineer, to ensure
continued performance of SCMs permitted to be located in, or within 50 feet of,
water resources.
         C.   The location and documentation of all access and maintenance

owner, unless deemed as an emergency by the Village Engineer to verify that the
SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation.
         G.   The Village shall maintain public records of the results of site
inspections, shall inform the landowner(s), organization, or entity responsible
for maintenance of the inspection results, and shall specifically indicate any
corrective actions required to bring the SCMs into proper working condition.
         H.   If the Village notifies the landowner(s), organization, or entity
responsible for maintenance of the maintenance problems that require
correction, the specific corrective actions shall be taken within a reasonable
time frame as determined by the Village.
         I.   The Village is authorized to enter upon the property and to
perform the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the
landowner(s), organization, or entity responsible for maintenance does not make
the required corrections in the specified time period. The Village shall be
reimbursed by the landowner(s), organization, or entity responsible for
maintenance for all expenses incurred within 10 days of receipt of invoice from
the Village.
         J.   The method of funding long-term maintenance and inspections of

The owner must provide a draft of this Inspection and Maintenance Agreement as
part of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan submittal. Once a draft is
approved, a recorded copy of the Agreement must be submitted to the Village to
receive final inspection approval of the site.
         M.   Annual Inspection. There will be an annual inspection of all SCMs
indicated in the CSWM. A SCM, in this case, shall be considered all stormwater
facilities used for the purpose of water quality as decided upon by the Village
Engineer. Examples of SCMs requiring annual inspections are wet ponds, dry
ponds, sand filters, bio-swales, and constructed wetlands. The Village Engineer
may require inspections to be performed more regularly if deemed necessary.
            1.   The landowner(s) or organization shall use a stormwater
certified person (e.g., P.E., CESSWI, CPESC), as approved by the Village
Engineer, for annual stormwater inspections.
            2.   The Stormwater Inspector shall use the SCM inspection
checklist that is available from the Village Engineer upon request.
            3.   It is deemed a violation of this Section if the Village does
not receive the annual inspection report before August 1 of each year. In such
an event, the Village has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
any inspections as necessary to verify that the SCMs are being operated and
maintained in accordance with this Chapter and charge the responsible party
accordingly. Any accounts that are over 30 days delinquent may be certified to
the County Auditor, who shall then place the same on the tax duplicate of the
County, with interest as allowed by law, to be collected as taxes are
collected.

year;
            4.   Records of normal priority corrective actions from the
previous year;
            5.   Contact information of party submitting report.
            6.   The Village shall maintain public records of these annual
stormwater reports for a period of five years.
            7.   The Village Engineer, or his designated appointee, will
inspect all SCMs every five years to ensure the integrity of the annual
inspections.
         O.   Corrective Actions. Corrective actions created by the annual
inspection report shall be listed as either high priority or normal priority.
            1.   High priority items shall be corrected within three months of
the date of the inspection report unless allowed further time by the Village
Engineer. The certified Stormwater Inspector shall submit a letter to the
Village Engineer when any high priority item is completed so that the Village
Engineer can personally inspect.
            2.   Normal priority items shall be corrected before the next
annual inspection and will be listed in the next annual stormwater report.
            3.   The Village is authorized to enter upon the property and to
perform the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the
landowner(s) or organization responsible for maintenance does not make the
required corrections in the specified time period. In addition to any other
penalty provided for in this Chapter, the Village shall be reimbursed by the
landowner(s) or organization responsible for maintenance for all expenses
incurred within ten days of receipt of invoice from the Village.
      (11)   Required calculations:  The owner shall submit calculations for
projected stormwater runoff flows, volumes, and timing into and through all
SCMs for flood control, channel protection, water quality, and the condition of
the habitat, stability, and incision of each water resource and it's the
floodplain, as required in Section
 1317.09 of this regulation. These submittals shall be completed for both pre-
and post-development land use conditions and shall include the underlying
assumptions and hydrologic and hydraulic methods and parameters used for these
calculations. The owner shall also include critical storm determination and
demonstrate that the runoff from offsite areas have been considered in the
calculations.
      (12)   List of all contractors and subcontractors before construction:
Prior to construction or before the pre-construction meeting, provide the list
of all contractors and subcontractors and their names, addresses, and phones
involved with the implementation of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan including a written document containing signatures of all parties as proof
of acknowledgment that they have reviewed and understand the requirements and
responsibilities of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
      (13)   Existing and proposed drainage patterns: The location and
description of existing and proposed drainage patterns and SCMs, including any
related SCMs beyond the development area and the larger common development
area.
      (14)   For each SCM to be employed on the development area, include the
following:
         A.   Location and size, including detail drawings, maintenance
requirements during and after construction, and design calculations, all where
applicable.
         B.   Final site conditions including stormwater inlets and permanent
nonstructural and structural SCMs. Details of SCMs shall be drawn to scale and
shall show volumes and sizes of contributing drainage areas.
         C.   Any other structural and/or non-structural SCMs necessary to meet
the design criteria in this regulation and any supplemental information
requested by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Each SCM shall be designated with an individual identification
number. (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Stormwater Design General Information. No person shall develop any
real property or connect or cause to be connected any building or other
structure, either directly or indirectly, with a drain for the removal of
surface, roof, ground or other water to be discharged into a ditch, swale,
waterway, stream or an existing storm drainage system for such real property,
without complying with the performance standards and paying the charges set
forth in this chapter.
 
   (b)   General:  The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and comply with Chapter
1340 Riparian Setbacks.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village of Bratenahl and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   SCMs designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve the
stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with the
proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in 1121.23 of the Zoning Code, shall provide stormwater
management and water quality controls for the development of all subdivided
lots. This shall include provisions for lot grading and drainage that prevent
structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm; and maintain, to the
extent practicable, the pre-development runoff patterns, volumes, and peak
flows from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the owner shows
proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S.
Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required
in Section
1317.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1316 Erosion and Sediment Control and Chapter 1340 Riparian and Wetland Setback
Requirements, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater facilities in the floodplain: Stormwater facilities
constructed, manufactured or otherwise, that provide treatment of the water
quality volume (see Table 4, Section
1317.09), detention, retention, and/or infiltration, and all related
activities, shall not be constructed in any special flood hazard area, as
defined in Chapter
1315 Flood Damage Reduction.
      (6)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the owner shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (7)   Exemption:  The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1317.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCM, or if the
stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by SCMs defined in
a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the Village
Engineer.
      (8)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by the Village Engineer as
detailed in Section
1317.08.
      (9)   Agreements with Sub-dividers or Developers. A sub-divider or
developer shall be required to construct an on-site SCM for the purposes of
water quality and water retention approved by the Village Engineer. The
combination of stormwater quality and quantity requirements for two or more
developments may be placed into one detention basin to be located at a
strategic site given that a separate agreement with all parties is developed.
The Village shall enter into an agreement with the sub-divider or developer, to
be approved by Council, containing the following conditions:
         A.   The sub-divider of a major subdivision shall require the
formation of a homeowners' association, which shall assume responsibility for
all maintenance, upkeep, repair, replacement and management of the SCM. In
other developments, the sub-divider or developer shall make provisions
acceptable to the Village for maintenance of the SCM area as stated in Section
1317.10. Easements shall be granted to the Village for access to and
maintenance of the stormwater management area.
         B.   If more than one development is to use a single SCM, a separate
association of all members using that SCM shall be formed. This association
will be held responsible for all future maintenance and repairs of the SCM as
stated in this Chapter.
         C.   The sub-divider or developer shall be exempt from the application
of this Section only if authorized by the Village Engineer.
         D.   Where a sub-divider or developer is exempt from the provisions of
this Section, that sub-divider or developer shall comply with and pay fees in
accordance with this Chapter, governing subdivisions and development prior to
the effective date of this Section.
         E.   All SCMs will be placed within blocks and/or easements to allow
Village access (See Section
1317.11).
      (10)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. SCMs that preserve and/
or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent
practicable. Such SCMs may include minimizing site grading and compaction;
protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing
vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in
order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation
of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices;
and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas.
Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide perpetual management of
runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving stream's physical, chemical and
biological characteristics are protected and ecological functions are
maintained.
      (11)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology:  Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters a wetland(s) in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. SCMs such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration basins,
conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent streams,
depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the wetland
hydrology.
If the owner proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological analysis
shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches the pre-
development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics.
      (12)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
 
   (c)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Stream/storm sewer discharge. The stormwater facility (storm sewer
main or natural watercourse) that will convey the discharge from the site shall
be analyzed to determine if it is capable of conveying the additional storm
sewer discharge from the site of a 100-year/24-hour storm. If the designated
outlet is not capable of conveying the discharge from the site during the 100-
year/24-hour storm, then additional storage must be placed onsite to store the
additional volume for a period of 48 hours.
      (2)   Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the owner shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the
Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local
agencies as required in Section
1317.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1316 Erosion and Sediment Control and Chapter
1340 Riparian Setbacks all as determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum,
stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to
the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream
and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (3)   Off-site stormwater discharges:  Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the owner's development site shall be conveyed through
the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at its
existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this in not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (4)   Sheet flow. The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCM from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with landscaped
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (6)   Drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on all
new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm Sewer systems
shall be allowed to augment open drainage systems, such as to limit depth of
roadside or conveyance ditches. The following criteria shall be used to design
storm sewer systems when necessary:
         A.   Storm sewer design flow shall be based on the Rational Method.
Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge from runoff
caused by the 10 - year, 24 - hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade line of
the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying roadway, or
below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway, whichever is more
restrictive during a 25 - year, 24 - hour storm. The system shall be designed
to meet these requirements when conveying the flows from the contributing area
within the proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are
upstream from the development. These calculations will be reviewed and approved
by the Village Engineer prior to design acceptance. Rainfall data shall be
obtained from the latest volume of the NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1.
Runoff coefficients shall be per Table 2.
Table 1 - Rainfall per Storm Frequency

            Where:
          i = Rainfall intensity (in./hour)
          t = Time of concentration (minutes)
Refer to Ohio Department of Transportation's Location & Design Manual, Volume 2
(or latest edition) Drainage Design, Figure 1101-2 for Rainfall Intensity
Constants (a, b & c)The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces
no less than 2.5-fps and no more than a 10-fps velocity within the pipe barrel
under design flow conditions.
         C.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches.
         D.   All stormwater conveyance systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
            i.   Previous studies on file with the Village.
            ii.   FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
            iii.   Calculations prepared by a Registered Professional Engineer.
         E.   Catch basin design spread calculations shall be submitted to the
Village Engineer for review to determine catch basin spacing and sizing. At a
minimum, there shall be at least one total clear lane during a 25 year, 24 hour
storm.
         F.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Outlets discharging into an open-water conveyance structure shall
have an invert at a minimum of three inches above the average water depth
during the snow-melt season.
         I.   The flood elevation for a 100 year, 24 hour storm must be a
minimum of ten feet away horizontally from the perimeter of any homes within
the new subdivision, nor cause any home flooding to adjacent neighboring
properties, and shall be at least two feet below the finished grade elevation
of any livable structure.
         J.   All storm sewer outlets from a subdivision must flow either into
a public storm sewer, stream of the State, or a major ditch unless authorized
by the Village Engineer.
         K.   The maximum distance for sheet flow shall be 300 feet before
entering a storm structure. Except, that the maximum overland drainage area
tributary to the storm structure shall be no greater than 1.5 acres.
      (7)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross an water resource in the Village:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 100-year, 24-hour storm or as
indicated by the Village Engineer. The maximum allowed headwater for such a
storm shall be 12 inches below pavement crown elevation. Water crossings
carrying receiving waters located near upstream Village borders shall convey no
more flow than currently designed to carry unless directed by the Village
Engineer.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 100-year storm under these conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be one foot below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100 year, 24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA,
whichever is more restrictive.
      (8)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (9)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village must be
compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First consideration for
the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be given to areas
where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new floodplain
within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also be given to
enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for floodplain
fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless
otherwise permitted by the Village, reductions in volume due to floodplain
fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development.
Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to
the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical
retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (10)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be
placed at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide
non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Quality Control:  
      (1)   Direct runoff to a SCM: The site shall be designed to direct runoff
to one or more of the following SCMs. These SCMs are listed in Table 4 of this
regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general performance
standards:
         A.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         B.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
         C.   For sites disturbing less than five (5) acres, but greater than
one (1) acre and not part of a common plan of development or sale, where 5 or
more acres are disturbed, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
owner demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet
the objectives of this regulation.
         D.   For sites disturbing five (5) or more acres, or less than five
(5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the owner demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
 1317.09.C.6, and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         E.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Departments of Transportations "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
         F.   The Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the owner
demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs meet the
objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1317.09.C.6.
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         A.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
                  WQV =    C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
                  WQV   =    water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C    =    runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than
1 in.
                  P   =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A   =    area draining into the SCM, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the water quality volume can be determined using
the list in Table 3 or using the following equation to calculate the runoff
coefficient:
 
               C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
               i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
 
 
Table 3: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
 
         B.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the SCM for sediment storage. This volume shall be
incorporated into the sections of SCMs where pollutants will accumulate.
         C.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         D.   SCMs for quality shall be designed such that the drain time is
long enough to provide treatment and protect against downstream bank erosion,
but short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall events as
defined in Table 4.
         E.   All wet or dry extended stormwater detention facilities shall
have a forebay and micropool as per the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
 
 
Table 4: Draw Down Times for Stormwater Control Measures
Stormwater Control Measure                      Drain Time of WQv

• Sand and Other Media Filtration 5           24 hours
• Pocket Wetland 7                            24 hours
1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQv .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
 
         F.   Each SCM shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
         G.   The seasonal high groundwater elevation is the normal water line
or normal elevation of saturation.
         H.   Water quality volume (WQv) orifices less than 3-inches in
diameter shall be designed with an anti-clogging or non-clogging design.
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         A.   Infiltration facilities shall only be allowed if the soils of the
facility have an infiltration rate between 0.5 in./hr. and 4.0 in./hr. (or
deemed acceptable by the Village Engineer)), if the seasonal high water table
is at least three (3) feet below the final grade elevation, and any underlying
bedrock is at least six feet below the final grade elevation. Infiltration
trenches should be designed to meet all criteria in the current edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
         B.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         C.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria applying to extended conveyance facilities.
         A.   Facilities designed according to the extended conveyance
detention design drain time shall:
            1.   Not be located in areas where the depth to bedrock and/or
seasonal high water table is less than 3 feet below the final grade elevation.
            2.   Only be allowed where the underlying soil consists of
hydrologic soil group (HSG) A or B, unless the underlying soil is replaced by
at least a 2.5 foot deep layer of soil amendment with a permeability equivalent
to a HSG A or B soil and an underdrain system is provided.
         B.   Concentrated runoff shall be converted to sheet flow, or a
diffuse flow using a plunge pool, flow diffuser or level spreader, before
entering an extended conveyance facility.
      (5)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         A.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. If
elevation allows, a valve shall be provided to drain any permanent pool volume
for removal of accumulated sediments. The outlet shall be designed to minimize
clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and promote the capture of floatable
pollutants.
         B.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            1.   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run to
rise ratio of 3:1 or flatter.
            2.   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with hardy native species of plants comparable to
wetland vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of
invasive plant species is prohibited.
            3.   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            4.   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (6)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The owner may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the owner shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 5. If the site disturbs greater than five (5) acres, or less
than five (5) acres but is part of a larger common plan of development or sale
which will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA and
Village of Bratenahl is necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the owner
must show:
         A.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the owner can demonstrate one
of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            4.   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Developers or sub-dividers shall include in their preliminary plans
a local watershed study to determine the impact from the development or
subdivision caused by stormwater onto the lands adjoining or downstream from
the area to be developed, to assure that said lands shall not be adversely
affected by the proposed development or subdivision.
      (3)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (4)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method, or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            4.   Rainfall data shall be obtained from the latest volume of the
NOAA Rainfall ATLAS 14 or per Table 1.
            5.   Temporal Distribution. Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            6.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition must reflect
the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the current
land use. Curve Numbers shall conform to the National Engineering Handbook
Table 9-1.
               i.   Post-development Curve Numbers - All areas that are altered
by construction practices shall use post-construction Hydraulic Soil Groups
from Ohio Rainwater and Land Development.
            7.   Time of Concentration- Use velocity based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
            8.   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Ohio Rainwater and Land Development Manual or a
hydrologic model acceptable to the Village Engineer.
            9.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the
site, calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or
concrete for all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface
proposed in the site description, except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems.
         B.   From the volume determined in Section
1317.09(D)(3)(a), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
5.
 
Table 5: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
 
 
         C.   For sites with less than one acre of disturbed land and not part
of a common plan of development:
            i.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is less than
110% of the pre-developed critical storm flow, no stormwater quantity measures
need to be implemented.
            ii.   If the post-developed flow for the critical storm is equal to
or greater than 110% of the pre-developed critical storm, stormwater quantity
measures need to be implemented so that the post-developed critical storm flow
is less than the pre-developed critical storm flow.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects:  Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing
site impervious areas by at least 20 percent. A one-for-one credit towards the
20 percent net reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the use of
green roofs.
      (1)   Where site conditions prevent the reduction of impervious area,
SCMs shall be implemented to treat at least 20 percent of the WQv.
      (2)   When a combination of impervious area reduction and stormwater
quality control facilities are used, ensure a 20percent net reduction of the
site impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percentof the WQv,
or a combination of the two.
      (3)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume that must be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 20 percent.
      (4)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
 1317.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
         (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.10 ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the
water quality volume at the point of retrofit, whichever is greater.
      (4)   An inspection and maintenance agreement as described in Chapter
1317.08.D.10 is established to ensure operations and treatment in perpetuity.
      (5)   Obtain prior written approval from Ohio EPA.
 
   (b)   Alternative actions may include, but are not limited to the following.
All alternative actions shall be approved by the Village Engineer:
      (1)   Fees, in an amount specified by the Village to be applied to
community-wide SCMs.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site SCMs and/or the retrofit of an existing
SCM to increase quality and quantity control.
      (3)   Stream, floodplain, or wetland restoration.
      (4)   Acquisition or conservation easements on protected open space
significantly contributing to stormwater control such as wetland complexes.
         (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
  
   1317.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village prior to approval of a
final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga Auditor and on all property
deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire SCM plus an additional 25-foot
wide band around the perimeter of the SCM.
   (d)   The easement shall be graded and/or stabilized as necessary to allow
maintenance equipment to access and manipulate around and within each facility,
as defined in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement for the site.
   (e)   Easements to structural SCMs shall be restricted against the
construction therein of buildings, fences, walls, and other structures that may
obstruct the free flow of stormwater and the passage of inspectors and
maintenance equipment; and against the changing of final grade from that
described by the final grading plan approved by the Village. Any re-grading
and/or obstruction placed within a maintenance easement may be removed by the
Village at the property owners' expense.
      (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.12 MAINTENANCE AND FINAL INSPECTION APPROVAL.
   To receive final inspection and acceptance of any project, or portion
thereof, the following must be completed by the owner and provided to the
Village Engineer:
   (a)   Final stabilization must be achieved and all permanent SCMs must be
installed and made functional, as determined by the Village Engineer and per
the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   An As-Built Certification, including As-Built Survey and Inspection,
must be sealed, signed and dated by a Professional Engineer and a Professional
Surveyor with a statement certifying that the SCMs, as designed and installed,
meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan approved
by the Village Engineer. In evaluating this certification, the Village Engineer
may require the submission of a new set of SCM calculations if he/she
determines that the design was altered significantly from the approved
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. The As-Built Survey must provide the
location, dimensions, and bearing of such SCMs and include the entity
responsible for long-term maintenance as detailed in the Inspection and
Maintenance Agreement.
   (c)   A copy of the complete and recorded Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement as specified in Section
1317.08 must be provided to the Village Engineer.
      (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.13 ON-GOING INSPECTIONS.
   The owner shall inspect SCMs regularly as described in the Inspection and
Maintenance Plan and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The Village of
Bratenahl has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct inspections
as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to verify that the
SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this regulation. Upon
finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance or repair, the Village of
Bratenahl shall provide written notification to the responsible party, as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance. Upon finding a malfunction or other need for maintenance, the
Village shall provide written notification to the responsible party, as
detailed in the Inspection and Maintenance Agreement, of the need for
maintenance. Upon notification, the responsible party shall have ten (10)
working days, or other mutually agreed upon time, to makes repairs or submit a
plan with detailed action items and established timelines. Should repairs not
be made within this time, or a plan approved by the Village Engineer for these
repairs not be in place, the Village may undertake the necessary repairs and
assess all costs to the responsible party. (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.14 FEES.
   The Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan review, filing, and inspection
fee is part of a complete submittal and is required to be submitted to the
Village before the review process begins. The Village Engineer shall establish
a fee schedule based upon the actual estimated cost for providing these
services.
   On-Going Inspections, as required in
 1317.14 shall be funded by the Owner through a one-time fee, payable to the
Village at the time of the request for final inspection of the stormwater
management facilities. The fee shall be as follows:
   Dwelling House District, Apartment House District or Residential Open Space
Conservation District- $750 per lot, minimum of $3,750, maximum amount of
$7,500.
   Retail Business District- $5,000
(Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.15 BOND.
   (a)   If a Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan is required by this
regulation, soil-disturbing activities shall not be permitted until a cash bond
of 5% of the total project cost, has been deposited with the Village Finance
Department. This bond shall be posted for the Village to perform the
obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner of the development area as
stated in this regulation and to allow all work to be performed as needed in
the event that the owner fails to comply with the provisions of this
regulation. The stormwater bond will be returned, less Village administrative
fees as detailed in Chapter
1317 of the Village Codified Ordinances, when the following three criteria are
met:
      (1)   After 80% of the lots of the project have been complete or 100% of
the total project has been permanently stabilized or three (3) years from the
time of permanent stabilization have passed.
      (2)   An As Built Inspection of all water quality practices is conducted
by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   An Inspection and Maintenance Agreement signed by the developer,
the contractor, the Village, and the private owner or homeowners association
who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs, is accepted by the
Village Engineer.
 
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the owner shall be reimbursed all bond
monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these criteria
are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site, the
Village may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding issues with all
stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder of the bond
shall be given to the private lot owner/ homeowners association for the purpose
of long term maintenance of the project. (Ord. 3903. Passed 1-18-17.)
 
   1317.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY SCMS.
   The owner may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site

   1340.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas, rivers,
streams, and other natural watercourses within the Village contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. This chapter shall apply
to all lands that are within the jurisdiction of the Village and the designated
watercourses and wetlands as defined in this chapter.
   (a)   It is the intent of the Village of Bratenahl to adopt regulations for
construction sites that protect the quality of both local and state water
resources and both adjoining and downstream property owners from:
      (1)   Loss or disturbance of riparian areas, and
      (2)   Loss or disturbance of wetlands.
   (b)   The specific purpose and intent of this chapter is to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow;
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks;
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in the
watercourse;
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses;
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food;
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife,
many of which are on Ohio’s endangered and/or Threatened Species listing, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation; and
      (7)   Benefit the Village economically by minimizing encroachment on
wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions
such as dams and retention basins to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to the
scenic beauty and environment of the Village, and thereby preserving the
character of the Village, the quality of life of the residents of the Village,
and corresponding property values.
   (c)   The Village shall issue no approvals and permits without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter.
   (d)   This chapter gives the Village of Bratenahl authority to adopt,
implement, use, and require that developers and builders in the Village use

be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a Qualified Forester and accepted by the Village.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a $1,000
performance guarantee with the Village. This performance guarantee shall be in
the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check or Case, and it
shall be held until completion of the timber-harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than six (6) inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into sections no
longer than six (6) feet or removed from the 100-year flood plain. Harvested
trees or felled logs/branches that are part of a designed and approved
Streambanks Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to
remain in a designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. "Adequately stocked" shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B- Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the forest Village to be
harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
high water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees from
riparian and wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.

            6.   Provide the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers.
      (2)   Streambank Stabilization and Erosion Control Measures. Streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical. The streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Village.
      (3)   Crossings. Crossing of designated watercourses and through riparian
setbacks by publicly and privately owned sewer and/or water lines and public
and private utility transmission lines shall only be allowed upon approval of a
Crossing Plan by the Village. Such crossings shall minimize disturbance in
riparian setbacks and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances.
      (4)   Conservation Easements. Placing permanent conservation easements on
riparian and wetland setback areas is encouraged by the Village.

   1340.13 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Village may grant a variance from this chapter as provided herein.
In determining whether there is unnecessary or practical difficulty such as to
justify the granting of variance, the Village shall consider the potential harm
or reduction in riparian and/or wetland area functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the Village may consider the
following:
      (1)   The soil type natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year flood plain. The criteria of
the Village's flood damage prevention ordinances may be used as guidance when
granting variances in the 100-year flood plain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or other
functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall be
based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship this ordinance places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (4)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing

to the MS4.
(Ord. 3276. Passed 3-16-05.)
   1341.11 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The Village shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities
subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has security measures
in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow
access to representatives of the Village.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Village ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Village shall have the right to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Village to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.

the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a permitted
facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this chapter.
A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge
storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the
person denies the Village reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Village has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and it is able to demonstrate probable
cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there
is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling
program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the
community, then the Village may seek issuance of a search warrant from any
court of competent jurisdiction.

independent of any other section or division or any order issued pursuant to
this Property Maintenance Code or any provision of the International Property
Maintenance Code as adopted herein. Each day’s failure to comply with any such
section or division shall constitute a separate violation.

Property Maintenance Code or any provision of the International Property
