phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(R.C. § 1.42)
   (B)   Singular and plural; gender; tenses. As used in this code, unless the

      (3)   Words in the present tense include the future tense.
(R.C. § 1.43)
   (C)   Calendar; computation of time.
      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   LEGAL HOLIDAY, as used in divisions (C)(1) and (C)(2) of this

(R.C. § 1.14)
      (5)   When an act is to take effect or become operative from and after a
day named, no part of that day shall be included. If priority of legal rights
depends upon the order of events on the same day, such priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(R.C. § 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from

inconsistent with state law or municipal charter provisions.
   (G)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
contains any express provision excluding such construction, or when the subject
matter or context of such law is repugnant thereto.
§ 10.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (A)   The repeal of a repealing statute does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(R.C. § 1.57)
   (B)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in division (C) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the ordinance had not
been repealed or amended.
   (C)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(R.C. § 1.58)
   (D)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(R.C. § 1.54)
§ 10.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (A)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
   (B)   References in the code to action taken or authorized under designated
sections of the code include, in every case, action taken or authorized under
the applicable legislative provision which is superseded by this code.
(R.C. § 1.23)
   (C)   A reference to any portion of a provision of this code applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(R.C. § 1.55)
   (D)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(R.C. § 1.56)

the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter has been
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
§ 10.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(R.C. § 1.51)
   (B)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of the Legislative
Authority are irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment
prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Legislative Authority, one amendment without reference to
another, the amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may
be given to each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the
latest in date of enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates
language deleted by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted
by an earlier amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
(R.C. § 1.52)
   (C)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this code,
or between any of the provisions of this code and any standard code adopted by
the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 731.231, the provision that establishes the
higher or stricter standard shall control.
§ 10.07 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of this code or the application thereof to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of the section or related sections which can
be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end
the provisions are severable.
(R.C. § 1.50)
§ 10.08 REFERENCE TO OFFICES.
   Reference to a public office or officer shall be deemed to apply to any
office, officer, or employee of the municipality exercising the powers, duties,
or functions contemplated in the provision, irrespective of any transfer of
functions or change in the official title of the functionary.
§ 10.09 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered consisting of the misspelling of any
words, the omission of any words necessary to express the intention of the
provisions affected, the use of words to which no meaning can be attached, or
the use of a word when another word was clearly intended to express the
intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or
substituted shall conform with the manifest intention, and the provision shall
have the same effect as though the correct words were contained in the text as
originally published. No alteration shall be made or permitted if any question
exists regarding the nature or extent of such error.
§ 10.10 ORDINANCES REPEALED.
   With the exception of any ordinances specifically saved by the municipality,
this code, from and after its effective date, shall contain all of the
provisions of a general nature pertaining to the subjects herein enumerated and
embraced. All prior ordinances pertaining to the subjects treated by this code
shall be deemed repealed from and after the effective date of this code of
ordinances.
§ 10.11 ORDINANCES UNAFFECTED.
   All ordinances of a temporary or special nature, all other ordinances
pertaining to subjects not enumerated and embraced in this code of ordinances,
and all ordinances specifically saved by the municipality shall remain in full
force and effect unless herein repealed expressly or by necessary implication.
§ 10.12 ORDINANCES SAVED.
   Whenever an ordinance by its nature either authorizes or enables the
legislative body, or a certain municipal officer or employee, to make
additional ordinances or regulations for the purpose of carrying out the
intention of the ordinance, all ordinances and regulations of a similar nature
serving the purpose, effected prior to the codification and not inconsistent
thereto, shall remain in effect and are saved.
§ 10.13 APPLICATION TO FUTURE ORDINANCES.
   All provisions of Title I compatible with future legislation shall apply to
ordinances hereafter adopted amending or supplementing this code unless
otherwise specifically provided.
§ 10.14 INTERPRETATION.
   Unless otherwise provided herein, or by law or implication required, the
same rules of construction, definition, and application shall govern the
interpretation of this code as those governing the interpretation of state law.
§ 10.15 AMENDMENTS TO CODE; AMENDATORY LANGUAGE.
   (A)   Any chapter, section, or division amended or added to this code by
ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this code may be numbered in
accordance with the numbering system of this code and need not be inserted in
this code, but shall be treated as if printed for inclusion herein.
   (B)   The following language should be used by the municipality to amend,
add, or repeal a chapter, section, or division:

Ordinances is amended to read as follows: . . . .”

   (A)   If a statutory cite is included in the history, located in parenthesis
immediately following a division or section of this code, this indicates that

statutory provision. Example: (R.C. § 4511.02)

levied herein shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions,
and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident,
including the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through
entities owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the

profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   1.   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City of Wadsworth

plan.
         (d)   "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City of Wadsworth

compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
of Wadsworth for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)   The number of contact periods the individual has with the City
of Wadsworth. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the City of Wadsworth if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the City of Wadsworth and while away

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Wadsworth during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services

         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
of Wadsworth to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City of Wadsworth, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the City of Wadsworth may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
34.21(A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Wadsworth from a stock of goods located within the City of Wadsworth.
            2.   The property is delivered within the City of Wadsworth from a

engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City of Wadsworth and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the City of
Wadsworth to purchasers outside the City of Wadsworth, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Wadsworth to the extent that such services are performed in the City of
Wadsworth.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City of Wadsworth shall be sitused to the City

royalties from real property located in the City of Wadsworth shall be sitused
to the City of Wadsworth.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Wadsworth based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Wadsworth.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City of Wadsworth's tax only
if the property generating the net profit is located in the City of Wadsworth

of Wadsworth to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of the City of Wadsworth shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the City of Wadsworth. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
City of Wadsworth's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,

   (G)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under §
34.13, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (G)(1)(d)1. or 2. of this section, the location that
the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §
34.13.

   (A)   Withholding provisions. Each employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer located or doing business in the City of Wadsworth shall withhold an
income tax from the qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in
the City of Wadsworth. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not
required under § 34.12 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall
be withheld at the rate, specified in § 34.10(A) of this chapter, of 1.4%. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City of Wadsworth the greater of the income taxes deducted
and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City of Wadsworth in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399,
or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Wadsworth in any month of the

this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days

be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under § 6302 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26
C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the payment shall
be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Wadsworth. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Wadsworth as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City of Wadsworth income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City of Wadsworth the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a the
City of Wadsworth income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Wadsworth until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Wadsworth during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold City of Wadsworth
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)l. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            2.   For the purposes of division (C)(1)(c), the location at which

section, an employer is not required to withhold City of Wadsworth income tax
on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the City of Wadsworth if the employee performed such services in
the City of Wadsworth on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City

               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Wadsworth only if the employee spent more time performing services for
or on behalf of the employer in the City of Wadsworth than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Wadsworth exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Wadsworth for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Wadsworth.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Wadsworth under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for the City of Wadsworth for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Wadsworth.

outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Wadsworth. To determine whether

contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040 and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City of Wadsworth to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. §
5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms
prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the City of Wadsworth. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Wadsworth's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Wadsworth's income tax
return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after
January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the City of Wadsworth's income tax
return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the
eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return
relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Wadsworth's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's of the City of Wadsworth income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City of
Wadsworth income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of
Wadsworth's income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Wadsworth's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Wadsworth, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (G)(3), or (G)(4) of this section, the
tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City of Wadsworth
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City of Wadsworth for
a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
City of Wadsworth an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City of Wadsworth income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the City of
Wadsworth for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in §
34.13(C)(1)(g)) within the City of Wadsworth.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the City of
Wadsworth and does not expect to be subject to the City of Wadsworth income tax
for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City of Wadsworth. The affidavit shall
also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the City of Wadsworth, make any sales in the City of Wadsworth,
or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Wadsworth during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
City of Wadsworth for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Wadsworth income
tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of this timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City of Wadsworth by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in § 34.13 shall be allowed to the
taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the
City of Wadsworth, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the City of
Wadsworth and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City of Wadsworth to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Wadsworth,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Wadsworth or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the City of Wadsworth's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.
   (M)   (1)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway. Any taxpayer subject to
municipal income taxation with respect to the taxpayer's net profit from a
business or profession may file the City of Wadsworth's income tax return,
estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for filing a municipal
income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (N)   Extension for service in or for the armed forces. Each member of the
national guard of any state and each member of a reserve component of the armed
forces of the United States called to active duty pursuant to an executive
order issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of
the United States, and each civilian serving as support personnel in a combat
zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces, may apply to the
Tax Administrator of the City of Wadsworth for both an extension of time for
filing of the return and an extension of time for payment of taxes required by
the City of Wadsworth during the period of the member's or civilian's duty
service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under division (N) of this section, the Tax
Administrator shall enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of
the tax in installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such
contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes
pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and
the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest
in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under division (N) of this section, the applicant shall
neither be required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be
required to pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the
181st day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (O)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (O)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (R)   Consolidated municipal income tax return. As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group
includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Wadsworth's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (S)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Wadsworth. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (V)(3), and
(V)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
34.11, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
34.11(C) in the definition of adjusted federal taxable income to the extent
that the item of income or deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has
been eliminated or consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal
taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax return shall do
one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or
loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
34.14(R) through (Y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Wadsworth. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
34.14(R) through (Y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Wadsworth. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
34.14(R) through (Y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Wadsworth;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of
Wadsworth income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
34.14(R) through (Y) by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Wadsworth income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Wadsworth in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Wadsworth before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Wadsworth may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

§ 34.15 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in The City of Wadsworth who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying
wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the
other municipality by the lower of the tax rate in such other municipality or
the rate of 1.0%.
   (B)   The City of Wadsworth shall grant a credit against its tax on income
to a resident of The City of Wadsworth who works in a joint economic
development zone created under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development
district created under R.C. §§ 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.16 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City of Wadsworth's income
tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City of Wadsworth
for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is
entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or
credit from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the City of Wadsworth from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the City of Wadsworth in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
34.14(G) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of
Wadsworth, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable
year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the 15th day of the
12th month of the taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or

      (3)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
34.14.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
34.27 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the

period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the City of Wadsworth
under §
34.14 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Wadsworth
but was not domiciled here on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

entered on the document.

§ 34.18 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
§
34.27.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is $10 or more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
34.30.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
34.27(A)(4).
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.19 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Wadsworth, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Wadsworth as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Wadsworth is subject to recovery by the
City of Wadsworth. If the City of Wadsworth's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the City of Wadsworth shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the City of Wadsworth claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the City of Wadsworth's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
Wadsworth's tax rate. However, if Wadsworth's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the City of Wadsworth, along with any penalty and
interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.20 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City of Wadsworth changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Wadsworth. The amended return shall be filed on a form
required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
34.21 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is less than $10, no
refund need be paid by the City of Wadsworth. A request filed under this
division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's
annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed in §
34.18.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Wadsworth's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Wadsworth return showing income
subject to City of Wadsworth income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City of
Wadsworth income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax due or overpayment is less than $10.

§ 34.21 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in §
34.30. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the 60th day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
34.18.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Wadsworth does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
34.18, with interest on that amount as provided by §
34.18(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover City of Wadsworth income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.22 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   (D)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   (E)   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who
is not an attorney.
   (F)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (G)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (H)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.23 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to
deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-
delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Wadsworth official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
      (3)   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
      (4)   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of
Wadsworth official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.24 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to The City of Wadsworth that arises pursuant to The City of Wadsworth's income
tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.25 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by §§
34.10 through
34.35 is confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information
except in accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the
performance of that person's official duties or the official business of the
City of Wadsworth as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the City of Wadsworth from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-095, passed 11-4-15)
§ 34.26 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Wadsworth ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or

Administrator.

      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing

         (b)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City of Wadsworth or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail

the Tax Administrator from requiring any person filing a tax document with the
Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may include the
person's social security number, federal employer identification number, or
other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A person
required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify the Tax
Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax document
requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
34.27, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
34.99.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under §
34.28(C) within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to §
34.27.
         (c)   The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
34.99 for a violation of §
34.26 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

the vicinity of local hotels, and expenditures to promote economic development,
an excise tax is hereby levied on transactions by which accommodations in a
hotel are or are to be furnished to transient guests. The tax shall be 3% of
the rent paid or to be paid by the transient guest for the uses set forth in
the definition of “hotel” in §
34.56. The tax shall apply and be due at the time the accommodations are
furnished, regardless of the time when the rent is paid.
   (B)   In order to insure the proper administration of this chapter and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is hereby presumed that all accommodations
furnished by hotels in this city to transient guests are subject to the tax
until the contrary is established. Such tax shall constitute a debt owed by the
transient guest which debt is discharged only by payment to the operator as
trustee for the city. Each transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of
the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment.
   (C)   If any guest should refuse to pay such tax to the operator, the
operator shall immediately notify the Tax Administrator of such refusal and the
Administrator may require that such transient guest pay the tax due directly to
him.

§ 35.05 VACATIONS.
   Each full-time employee of the city shall be entitled to vacation with pay
in accordance with the following provisions:
   (A)   Vacation accrual.
      (1)   Schedule of vacation computation.
         (a)   Beginning January 1, 2019, full-time non-probationary employees
shall begin to earn and accrue vacation leave according to the following
schedule:
 
Length of Service              Rate of Accrual per Regular Hour Yearly Accrual
                               Worked
Hire date to less than 4 years .038462 hours                    10 days
4 years but less than 9 years  .057692 hours                    15 days
9 years but less than 14       .076923 hours                    20 days
14 years but less than 18      .088462 hours                    23 days
18 years or more               .096154 hours                    25 days
 
         (b)   This vacation accrual shall be posted to the employee's balance
at the completion of each pay period.
         (c)   During the course of a calendar year, if an employee completes
the requisite number of years of service to move to the next higher level of
vacation accrual, the employee shall begin earning vacation leave at the higher
rate at the beginning of the pay period that includes the anniversary date to
which the employee became eligible to earn vacation leave.
         (d)   When he or she deems the circumstance appropriate, the
Appointing Authority shall have discretion to deviate from the above accrual
schedule to address issues of recruitment and retention.
      (2)   Unpaid leave. Vacation leave shall not accrue during any unpaid
leave of the employee.
      (3)   Probationary employees. Newly-hired employees in a probationary
period shall accrue vacation from the date of hire pursuant to the schedule set
forth in division (A)(1) of this section. Probationary employees shall only be
entitled to use vacation leave following the first six months of employment
unless an exception is approved by the Appointing Authority.
      (4)   Prior service. Vacation accrual shall be based upon the employee's
most recent date of full-time hire. Separate periods of employment with the
city may not be combined together for vacation accrual purposes. Employees
hired prior to June 24, 1987 who have prior service with a public entity within
the State of Ohio shall be entitled to a maximum of one year of service credit
towards vacation accrual. Prior public service for employees hired on or
subsequent to June 24, 1987 shall not be recognized.
      (5)   Vacation leave balance. The official record of vacation leave shall
be kept in Human Resources/Payroll. The unused accrued vacation leave balance
will be reflected on an employee's pay stub. However, the balance will reflect
the amount of unused vacation leave at the conclusion of the pay period, which
is the Saturday immediately prior to the payday on Friday.
      (6)   Minimum usage. Vacation leave shall be scheduled in one hour
increments. At the discretion of the supervisor or department head, vacation
leave may be used in one minute increments to complete a work day (seven or
eight hours) or work week (35 or 40 hours) if no other leave is available or
appropriate. Regardless of the increment used, weekly hours shall not be less
than the total weekly hours for which the employee is regularly scheduled
unless approved by the Appointing Authority and Human Resources.
      (7)   Application for vacation leave. An employee shall complete a
Request for Leave Form specifying the date(s) and time(s) of the requested
vacation. Such requests shall be submitted to the employee's immediate
supervisor as soon as reasonably possible. Vacation requests may be considered
for approval by the supervisor following the consideration of such factors as
volume of work within the department at the time of the request, staffing
levels and the seniority of the employee making the request. All approved
vacation leave requests should be forwarded to Human Resources as soon as
reasonably possible for processing.
      (8)   Notification of use.
         (a)   Employees should attempt to provide advanced notice of vacation
requests to their immediate supervisor according to the following schedule:
 
Length of Vacation Request Advanced Notice to Supervisor
1 day or less              24 hours
2 to 4 days                1 week
1 week                     30 days
 
         (b)   Vacation requests submitted outside of this schedule shall be
approved only at the discretion of the supervisor.
      (9)   Vacation leave accrual limits. An employee may accumulate vacation
leave, but shall not exceed a balance that is two times his or her annual rate
of accrual.
      (10)   Vacation usage. In any given calendar year, an employee may use
vacation leave in an amount that exceeds his or her annual rate of accrual,
provided that he or she has the appropriate balance of unused accumulated
vacation leave.
      (11)   Separation of service.
         (a)   Any unused portion of vacation at the time of separation (i.e.,
resignation, retirement, removal, death) shall be paid to the employee at the
wage rate earned at the time of separation. An employee who separates service
prior to any retroactive pay adjustment shall be compensated at the rate of pay
in effect at the time of separation.
         (b)   Probationary employees are not eligible to receive payment for
any unused portion of vacation leave at the time of separation.
   (B)   Collective bargaining agreements. The provisions of divisions (A) and
(B) of this section shall not apply to any city employees for whom vacation
entitlement is set forth in a collective bargaining agreement.

active service with the city, with ten or more years of service with the state,
any political subdivision or any combination thereof, may elect to receive
payment of his or her accrued, but unused sick leave.
      (1)   Employees hired prior to June 1, 2012 shall have a maximum amount
to be paid at 1280 hours of accrued but unused sick leave. The payment shall be
based upon the employee's rate of pay at the time of retirement. Such a payment
eliminates all sick leave credit accrued, but unused by the employee at the
time the payment is made. Such a payment shall only be paid once to an
employee, even if he or she is subsequently employed by the city following
retirement.
      (2)   A retirement-eligible employee hired on or after June 1, 2012 shall
be entitled to compensation for one-fourth the value of the employee's accrued
but unused sick leave credit. The payment shall be based on the employee's rate
of pay at the time of retirement and eliminates all sick leave credit accrued
but unused by the employee at the time payment is made. The sick leave credit
that is paid shall not exceed the value of 480 hours of sick leave. Such a
payment shall only be paid once to an employee, even if he or she is
subsequently employed by the city following retirement.
   (C)   Sick leave payment upon death. A retirement-eligible employee with ten
or more years of service with the state, any political subdivision or any
combination thereof, upon death shall be paid his or her accrued but unused
sick leave. The payment shall be made to the employee's beneficiaries as
designated for his or her life insurance benefit. The value of the sick payment
shall be consistent with date of hire provisions identified above in division
(B).
   (D)   Other forms of separation (e.g., resignation, removal). An employee
who separates employment with the city in a manner other than retirement or
death is not eligible for a payment of accrued but unused sick leave.
   (E)   (1)   A full-time city employee with one or more years of continuous
service with the city shall be entitled to three personal leave days per year.
Employees shall accrue personal leave days on January first. Newly-hired

May through August         1 Personal Days

      (2)   Personal leave must be taken in increments of one day. Personal
leave days are forfeited if not used by the end of the year. Any unused
accumulated personal leave days at the time of separation of employment shall
be forfeited.
   (F)   Each employee entitled to sick leave shall also be entitled to
bereavement leave for a death in the employee’s immediate family. The immediate
family for the purposes of bereavement leave shall be defined as the employee’s
spouse, child, stepchild, grandchild, parents, parents-in- law, stepparents,
brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, grandparents and siblings. Up
to three consecutive bereavement leave days may be taken, one of which is the
day of the funeral. In the discretion of the appointing authority, an
appointing authority may grant additional days of bereavement leave. All days
of bereavement leave taken shall be deducted from the employees’ accumulated

§ 35.11 ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING AND RELATED PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Policy. It is the policy of the city to maintain a drug-free work
environment through the use of a reasonable employee drug-testing program. Any
candidate who has been identified for hire with the city shall be administered
a pre-employment drug screen prior to receiving a final and firm offer of
employment. Candidates who do not successfully complete or pass the drug screen
shall not be appointed to a city position. No person shall begin employment
until a negative test result is received by Human Resources.
   (B)   Definitions.
      (1)   BLOOD ALCOHOL CONTENT (BAC) TEST. A test to determine the amount of
alcohol that is in a person's body by measuring the amount of alcohol in the
air that the person exhales.
      (2)   CERTIFIED MEDICAL REVIEW OFFICER (MRO). A physician identified as a
certified MRO by the testing agency to receive and evaluate results of drug
test(s) performed on employees.
      (3)   CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE OR OTHER DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES. All items
listed in the R.C. § 3719.41 or other pharmaceuticals that are available only
by professional legal medical prescription.
      (4)   DRUG TEST. The production and submission of urine or other bodily
fluids by an employee for chemical analysis to detect prohibited drug usage.
      (5)   POST-ACCIDENT TEST. A test conducted on an employee to determine
whether drug or alcohol was a factor in an on-the-job accident (vehicular or
otherwise) that may have involved human error which may have caused injury or
property damage.
      (6)   REASONABLE SUSPICION. Means objective facts or specific
circumstances found to exist, including inferences from those facts and
circumstances which present a reasonable basis to believe an employee on duty
is under the influence of alcohol or is using or abusing illegal drugs.
      (7)   REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. Rebuttable presumption means a positive
test for alcohol or any of nine specified controlled substances (drugs) by the
Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation or a refusal to be tested can create a
presumption that the presence of alcohol/drugs in an employee's system is the
proximate cause of a work-related injury, which may make the injured workers'
claim non-compensable.
      (8)   SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITION. Any position through the nature of the
assigned duties could be detrimental or dangerous to the physical well-being of
the employee, co-workers or the general public through a lapse of attention or
judgment. This may include positions where the national security or the
security of employees or the general public may be jeopardized or compromised
through a lapse in attention or judgment.
   (C)   Prohibited activity. The following rules shall apply to all employees
while on and off duty:
      (1)   No employee shall illegally possess any controlled substance.
      (2)   No employee shall ingest any controlled or other dangerous
substance, unless as currently prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner.
      (3)   No employee shall ingest any prescribed medication in amounts
beyond the prescribed dosage.
      (4)   No employee will report to work with a BAC of .02 of one gram by
weight of alcohol per 210 liters of breath or greater or .02 of 1% by weight of
alcohol in blood or greater or .0028 of a gram by weight of alcohol per 100 ml
of urine or greater.
   (D)   Notification of medications. Employees shall notify their immediate
supervisor and/or Human Resources when using a prescription medicine, which has
the potential to impair job performance. The employee shall advise the
supervisor of the known side effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, slurred
speech, motor impairment, depression) of such medication and the prescribed
period of use. Human Resources shall maintain any documentation of an
employee's prescription in a secured medical file.
   (E)   Unintended medication ingestion. Any employee who unintentionally
ingests, or is made to ingest a controlled substance shall immediately report
the incident to their supervisor so that appropriate medical steps may be taken
to ensure the employee's health and safety.
   (F)   Random drug test.
      (1)   All employees of the city shall be subject to random drug and/or
alcohol testing. An employee who performs work of a safety-sensitive nature
shall be subject to random drug and/or alcohol testing equivalent to current
DOT requirements. The Human Resources Manager shall maintain a database of
those employees who work in safety-sensitive positions. The Human Resources
Manager shall determine the frequency and timing of random drug tests.
Employees shall be randomly selected and identified through the local
occupational health facility.
      (2)   When initiating a random test, the Human Resources Manager shall
contact the supervisor or department head of an employee selected for a random
drug and/or alcohol test. The supervisor shall escort the employee to the
testing location as soon as practicable once notified of the need for a test.
An employee selected for a test that is absent or away from the city shall be
tested upon his return to the city during the same work shift or at the
beginning of the employee's next regularly scheduled work day. In such
situations, the employee shall not be provided with advanced notice that he/she
has been selected for a random test. If the employee is not scheduled to return
to work within 48 hours of the initial selection, the Human Resources Manager
will identify the next employee on the alternate list also provided by the
local occupational health facility, and follow the same procedure as described.
   (G)   Reasonable suspicion test.
      (1)   Any employee having a reasonable basis to believe that another
employee is illegally using, or in possession of any controlled substance shall
report the facts and circumstances to his or her supervisor.
      (2)   Any employee having a reasonable suspicion that another employee
appears to be under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol, shall
immediately report the facts and circumstances to their immediate supervisor or
in the absence of an immediate supervisor, any supervisor that is available to
witness the employee's observations.
      (3)   Should the supervisor concur with a reasonable suspicion of drug or
alcohol impairment, the supervisor shall require the employee to submit to a
reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol test and immediately provide for an
escort of the employee to and from the city's designated drug testing facility
or hospital emergency room (if off-hours). The supervisor shall attempt to
notify Human Resources of the need for a reasonable suspicion test. If prior
notification is not possible, Human Resources will be notified at the earliest
convenience.
   (H)   Post accident test. An employee who has been involved in an on-the-job
accident that may have involved human error that may have caused a fatality,
injury, or property damage may be taken for a post-accident drug and alcohol
test. The supervisor, department head or Human Resources Manager should
ascertain whether or not a test is necessary after taking into consideration
the nature of the accident, the weather conditions at the time of the accident
(if applicable) and the extent of any injuries or property damage. If
determined that a post-accident test is deemed necessary, the employee shall be
escorted by a supervisor/acting supervisor to the city's designated drug
testing facility or hospital emergency room (if off-hours) to determine whether
drug or alcohol use was a factor. The test should be administered as soon as
reasonably possible, but in no case more than 32 hours of the accident.
   (I)   Physical examinations. A drug test will be administered as part of any
regular, required physical examination.
   (J)   Testing facility. Drug and alcohol testing will be completed locally
by the occupational health department of the local hospital or as specifically
designated by the city. The Human Resources Manager should be contacted for the
location of a testing facility in circumstances where a drug and alcohol test
is required for an employee who is working outside of the city and where it
would be impractical for a test at the locally designated site.
   (K)   Testing process. 
      (1)   An employee shall submit to a pre-employment, random, reasonable
suspicion and post-accident test where required. Where an employee appears
unable or unwilling to give a specimen at the time of the test, the testing
personnel shall document the circumstances on the drug-test report form. The
employee shall be permitted no more than eight hours to give a sample, during
which time he or she shall remain in the testing area, under observation.
Reasonable amounts of water, not to exceed 16 fluid ounces, may be given to the
employee to encourage urination. Failure to submit a sample of urine within
eight hours of the original request will be considered a refusal to submit to a
drug-test.
      (2)   All costs associated with the testing process shall be assumed by
the city. All testing shall be done by certified personnel and in accordance
with generally recognized standards that assure privacy, accuracy and a
verifiable chain of evidence.
    (L)   Treatment.
      (1)   An employee who recognizes that they may have a drug and/or alcohol
problem is encouraged to voluntarily request treatment. A voluntary request for
treatment will not result in disciplinary action. However, the employee will be
required to follow up with any treatment recommended by the substance abuse
professional.
      (2)   An employee shall use accumulated sick leave, or other paid leave
in lieu of sick if no sick leave exists, during any period of in-patient or
out-patient drug and/or alcohol treatment that conflicts with the employee's
regular work schedule. The employee shall attempt to schedule treatment in such
a manner so as to not interfere with work where possible. Payment for this
treatment will be limited to the extent of coverage available under the city-
sponsored health insurance except as otherwise approved in advance by the
respective appointing authority.
      (3)   An employee who commits an offense which could result in
disciplinary action being taken and then voluntarily requests for substance
abuse treatment will not be exempt from disciplinary action.
   (M)   Corrective action. An employee who refuses to take/submit to a drug
and/or alcohol test when required by this policy may be subject to discipline,
up to and including termination. An employee who has a confirmed positive test
result in violation of the thresholds established in this policy, will be
immediately placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an
investigation and sent home for the day. The employee may be subject to
discipline, up to and including termination.
   (N)   Drug thresholds.
      (1)   The following drug thresholds apply for the initial (immunoassay)
and confirmatory (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) drug test:
 
                             Initial Test      Confirmatory Test
                             (Immunoassay)     (Gas Chromotography/Mass
                                                  Spectrometry)
Drug                      DOT (CDL's) All Others  DOT (CDL's) All Others
Amphetamines              500         1000        250         500
Cannabinoids              50          50          15          15
Cocaine (including crack) 150         300         100         150
Opiates                   300         2000        300         2000
Phencyclidine             25          25          25          25
 
      (2)   All thresholds values are expressed in nanograms per milliliter
(ng/mL).
   (O)   Rebuttable presumption. 
      (1)   If an employee sustains a work-related accident or illness and a
post-accident drug and alcohol test reflects a positive test result or the
employee refuses to be tested, it will be the intent of the city to seek a
disallowance of any subsequent Workers' Compensation claim. The city will
presume that alcohol consumption and/or the use of a controlled substance that
was not prescribed by the employee's physician was the main reason or cause of
the injury sustained.
       (2)   The burden of proof will be on the employee to prove that the
presence of alcohol or a controlled substance was not the proximate cause of
the work-related injury. An employee who tests positive or refuses to submit to
chemical testing may be disqualified for compensation and benefits under the
Workers' Compensation Act.

   (B)   Overtime, emergency call-outs and standbys, premium time, double time,
and meals.
      (1)   Overtime. Employees in the Department of Public Service may be
required to work overtime, unless unusual or emergency circumstances prevent
the employee from doing so. Employees entitled to overtime compensation under
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half
times the employee's hourly rate for all hours actually worked more than 40
hours in a work week. For purposes of overtime computation, the use of
vacation, personal leave, compensatory leave, bereavement leave, jury duty
leave and holidays shall be considered as time worked in computing whether more
than 40 hours are worked in a work week. Anticipated sick leave absences shall
also be counted in computing whether more than 40 hours are worked in a work
week, provided that the employee completes and submits an authorized request
for leave form to Human Resources no later than the day prior to the day of the
scheduled absence. Sick leave absences requested on the day of the absence or
later shall be considered as unscheduled absences and that leave time shall not
count as time actually worked in computing whether more than 40 hours are
worked in a work week. Employees entitled to overtime compensation under the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) who routinely work a 48 hour schedule in an
assigned department and who use sick leave that is considered unscheduled shall
not have that time count as time actually worked for a seventh workday within
the work week in computing whether more than 40 hours are worked in a workweek.
      (2)   Overtime exempt employees. Employees to whom the city is not
required to pay overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
may be required to work overtime but shall not be entitled to receive overtime
compensation. Employees exempt from receiving overtime compensation shall be
notified in writing and such notification shall be documented and maintained in
the employee's personnel file.
      (3)   Stand-by pay. In the Department of Public Service, a supervisor may
designate an employee entitled to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) as being on standby on a given weekday, weekend or
holiday. Employees so designated shall report for duty on an emergency call-
out. Employees designated as being on stand-by shall receive two hours of
compensation times their normal hourly rate of pay for each 24 hours of stand-
by beginning on Monday through Friday and three hours of compensation times
their normal hourly rate of pay for each 24 hours of stand-by beginning on
Saturday, Sunday or a paid holiday. The designated hours of stand-by may be
established within the department. Stand-by pay shall be paid in addition to
call-out pay.
      (4)   Emergency call-out pay. An employee in the Department of Public
Service who is entitled to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards
Act (FLSA) who is on standby and is called to work during a weekday standby
(beginning Monday through Friday) shall be paid at a rate of three and one-half
times the employee's normal hourly rate of pay for the first hour of work and
if called to work during a weekend or holiday standby (beginning on Saturday,
Sunday or a holiday) shall be paid at a rate of four and one-half times the
employee's normal hourly rate of pay for the first hour of work. All time
worked beyond the first hour on an emergency call-out will be compensated at a
rate one and one-half times the employee's normal hourly rate of pay except
that if an employee is called out prior to the start of the employee's
regularly assigned shift and continued to remain on duty into the employee's
regularly assigned shift, the employee shall be compensated at the employee's
regular rate of pay at the beginning of the regularly assigned shift. Employees
are eligible for emergency call-out pay regardless of the number of hours
worked in the week. An employee scheduled on a standby beginning on a weekend
or holiday may receive the four and one-half hours of pay for the first hour
worked only one time during a standby period and any subsequent call-out shall
be paid at a rate of three and one-half hours for the first hour worked.
Employees who are not scheduled to be on stand-by but who report for duty on a
call-out shall be paid at the employee's normal hourly rate for three and one-
half hours for the first hour of work and at the employee's normal hourly rate
for one and one-half hours for time worked beyond the first hour except that if
the employee reports for duty on a call-out and continues to remain on duty
into the employee's regularly assigned shift, the employee shall be compensated
at the employee's regular rate of pay at the beginning of the regularly
assigned shift.
      (5)   Earned rest. A full-time employee who works in excess of 16
continuous hours, excluding a meal period, or in excess of 16 work hours in any
24 hour period, without at least eight continuous hours off, shall be entitled
to a rest period of eight continuous hours upon being released from duty. An
employee will be paid his regular straight time rate for the time an earned
rest period overlaps his regularly scheduled work hours and will report to
duty, unless properly excused at the conclusion of the rest period, if the rest
period expires during his/her regularly scheduled hours. Following the rest
period, the employee shall report for duty and be paid at his/her regular rate
for the balance of the regularly scheduled work period.
      (6)   Premium time pay. An employee in the Department of Public Service
who is entitled to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) who is called to work on an unscheduled basis between the hours of 12:00
a.m. and 4:30 a.m. shall be entitled to two hours of premium pay at a rate two
times the employee's normal hourly rate of pay in addition to other
compensation received for said call out work. An employee may only receive
premium pay one time on a given day, regardless of the number of times the
employee is called out during the period.
      (7)   Double time pay. An employee in the Department of Public Service
who is entitled to overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA) who is required to work more than 16 continuous hours (excluding the
meal period) shall be compensated at two times the employee's normal hourly
rate of pay for all time worked in excess of 16 hours, regardless of the number
of hours worked in the workweek.
      (8)   Ineligibility for standby or call-out pay. An employee who uses
sick leave for an unscheduled absence for one full shift is not eligible to be
on standby or receive standby pay or to be subject to or receive compensation
for emergency call-out on the day that the employee is absent from work. An
employee who utilizes sick leave due to a death in the immediate family or who
utilizes bereavement leave is also not eligible to be on standby or receive
standby pay or to be subject to or receive compensation for an emergency call-
out on the day that the employee is absent from work. In the case of a large
scale emergency, the Director of Public Service may waive the provisions of
this division. An employee shall be eligible to be on standby and to receive
standby pay and to be subject to and receive compensation for emergency call-
outs during periods of vacation, personal leave or compensatory time off.
      (9)   Meals. If an employee in the Department of Public Service is
required to actually work 11 or more hours excluding the meal period, the
employee shall be furnished a meal at the end of the 11th hour. The employee
shall also be furnished a meal for each subsequent six-hour period until
released from duty. If an employee in the Department of Public Service is
called to work without notice, the employee shall be furnished a meal after
approximately six hours of work and approximately every six hours of work
thereafter until released from duty. If a call-out occurs at or near a normal
meal period and the employee reports to work without having eaten, the employee
shall be furnished a meal unless the employee is released from duty within
three hours of reporting to work. In order to be reimbursed for a meal, an
employee must submit the actual receipt from the retail establishment.
      (10)   Meal opt-out. Any employee who is entitled to a meal at the time
he/she is released from overtime work may, at his/her option, elect to receive
80% of one hour of pay at his/her rate of pay in lieu of such a meal.
      (11)   Protective footwear and clothing allowance. Employees in the
Department of Public Service whose job classifications require them to
routinely work outside exposing them to the elements of the weather so as to
necessitate a particular need for clothing and protective footwear shall be
entitled to an annual clothing allowance (including footwear). A full-time
employee shall receive a clothing allowance of $400 annually. The clothing
allowance will be paid to each employee on or about March 1 each year. The
appointing authority shall have the final discretion as to an employee's
eligibility for a clothing allowance. The clothing allowance is not to be paid
to Service Department employees with city-paid uniforms. The Appointing
Authority at his or her discretion may elect to reimburse certain employees for
footwear expenses based upon the specialized nature of the work performed. An
employee shall be responsible for the tax consequences of the allowance paid,
if applicable.

§ 50.03 UTILITY SERVICE AGREEMENT; DEPOSITS; GUARANTEE.
   (A)   All applicants for utility service from the city at premises shall,
prior to the beginning of utility service, be required to execute a utility
service agreement in the form set forth in the regulations promulgated by the
director of public service and, if applicable, provide surety in a form
prescribed by the city. Utility service shall not be provided to any premises
where the current property owner/tenant does not have a current utility service
agreement with the city.
   (B)   All applications involving the initial establishment of any utility
service to premises not previously served must be made by the property owner.
Where the premises, including temporary or portable structures, are
subsequently occupied by a tenant and, without relieving in any manner the
property owner of his responsibility for payment of all invoices, the city may
in its sole discretion invoice the tenant directly for utility service provided
to the premises and to require tenant to make a suitable security deposit as
provided for in this chapter to secure the payment of all invoices. However,
invoicing a tenant for utility services provided does not relieve the property
owner from liability for utility services provided to the premises and does not
prohibit the city from availing itself of its right to place liens against the
premises for non-payment of utility services pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (C)   (1)   Applicants who hold title to the premises where utility service
is being requested and who are not currently subject to any bankruptcy

required as follows:
         (a)   Residential: As determined by the Utility Office Rules and
Regulations.
         (b)   Commercial or industrial: the deposit shall be equal to a two
months average bill but in no event will the deposit be less than $300.
   (D)   The deposit shall be returned to the customer upon the customer's
cancellation of the utility service agreement, provided that customers who have
accounts with the city that are in delinquent status, or who have otherwise
evidenced a history of accounts being in delinquent status, may have their
deposit retained at the election of the city. No interest shall be accrued or
paid on any such deposit, except as may be prescribed by state law. The deposit
shall be returned at the end of five years from the date of the initial
deposit, provided that customers' account is in good standing with the city.
   (E)   In those instances where the applicant is not the property owner and
the city does not require the utility services agreement to be with the
property owner, the utility service agreement shall also contain the name and
mailing address of the property owner. The property owner shall be provided a
copy of invoices whenever such account is in delinquent status. The property
owner may be provided status of the account at anytime upon written request.
The city retains all legal rights to assess the premises and to place liens
against the premises for any delinquent utility accounts pursuant to the
authority granted by Chapter 7 of the Ohio Revised Code regardless of whether
the utility service agreement is with the property owner.
   (F)   Upon execution of a complete utility service agreement, proof of
identification, residency (copy of lease/rental agreement, proof of ownership),
the posting of any required deposit or the execution of a guarantee, payment of
outstanding balances due and owing the city by the applicant and acceptance by
the city, the applicant shall become a customer of the city's utility service.
The utility service agreement shall be between the city and the customer. The
city shall have all remedies available at law and equity to recover any and all
amounts due and owing to the city from the customer and/or guarantor, if
applicable, for the provision of utility service to the premises set forth in
the utility service agreement.
   (G)   All adults listed on the lease/rental/ mortgage, residing or occupying
any premises shall be listed on the utility service agreement and shall also
execute the utility service agreement.
   (H)   When a change of occupancy occurs in any premises receiving utility
service, an application by the new occupant must be made to the city. Each
person accepting utility service from the city without making proper
application therefore shall be deemed to be a customer for the purpose of this
chapter and the responsibilities and obligations herein. The city may terminate
such occupant's utility service, pursuant to the termination procedures set
forth in §
50.06 until proper application is made and approved by the city.
   (I)   When an initial meter reading is not available, the current occupant
will be liable for service, to be calculated on an estimated basis, from the
date of occupancy to the reading of the meter(s). The current occupant will not
be held liable for any utility service provided at that premises prior to that
occupant's date of actual possession of the premises.

   In those situations where a customer has not been issued a disconnection
notice, but the customer disputes a utility service invoice or portion thereof,
or the manner in which the utility service is being provided to their premises

the city staff, such customer may file a written request with the city on a
form provided by the city requesting a hearing before the Board of Utility
Appeals to have such concerns addressed. Such written requests shall provide

deems appropriate and which is consistent with these codified ordinances and
the regulations promulgated by the Public Service Director. The Board of

whatever terms and conditions are warranted in the continued provision of
utility service to the customer and the disconnection notice shall be
rescinded. If the Board finds that there is insufficient evidence presented and
that the customer should not be entitled to the relief sought and that the

the terms and conditions imposed the Board of Utility Appeals.

the metered KWH.
         (d)   Multiple dwelling units. Schedule "R" is applicable to existing
installations, where not more than three dwelling units, apartments, living
quarters or mobile homes are supplied through one meter. In such an event, for
billing purposes, the KWH shown for each rate step or block and the minimum
charge of the applicable rate shall be multiplied by the number of living
quarters served. Where four or more living quarters, or dwelling units are
supplied through one meter, the Commercial Schedule "C" shall apply. In all
cases where more than one unit is supplied through one meter, the property
owner of record shall receive all billings. All new installations shall be
separately wired, metered, and billed.
         (e)   Application for service. All applications for service shall be
in accordance with and conform to the provisions of Chapter 50 through Chapter
56 of this Code and the regulations adopted by the Director of Public Service
there under.
         (f)   Budgeted terms of payment for house heating service. At the
request of the consumer who is using electricity as the principle means of
heating a home, upon the approval of the electric utility, a budget plan for
the payment of electric service bills may be used. Based on actual experience
or history of usage, the electric utility will compute the annual electric
service bill for all purposes and divide same by 12. The result shall be the
amount to be paid by the consumer. All budget plans shall be applied for in
writing on electric utility's budget billing form and shall commence with the
bill payable in September of each year. At the end of each annual billing
period, terminating with the bill payable in August, the difference between the
amount payable for all of the KWH actually used by the consumer during the
first 11 months of said annual billing period and the amount actually paid
under the budget plan shall be determined and shall be the balance due the
electric utility. Said balance plus the actual bill for the twelfth month of
said annual billing period shall be payable in August on or before the date
specified on bill. Any overpayment will be credited to consumer's account.
Payments received after the due date noted on monthly bills will cause the
account to be removed from the budget billing plan.
         (g)   All new line extensions to permanent installations involving
more than an aggregate and combined distance of primary, secondary and service
drop in excess of 250 feet shall be subject to the conditions set forth in
electric utility's by-laws and regulations relating to "unusual service
extensions".
         (h)   The rates under Schedule "R" are based upon and dependant upon
federal, state, county, municipal, and other government levies, including gross
receipts, income taxes, license fees and other impositions of similar character
in effect as of May 1, 2001. In event of an increase in rates of existing taxes
of this character or additional new taxes, licenses or fees based upon
generation, distribution, purchase and/or sale of the electric power current or
energy, shall be imposed upon or required to be paid by the electric utility,
the rates herein may be increased by a surcharge equal to the amount of the
cost per KWH, or per consumer, or per demand or capacity or other applicable
unit of charge for such new or additional taxes, licenses or fees. No
adjustment shall be made due to variations or changes in the federal income tax
rate.
         (i)   Demand response service; Schedule "DR". Demand response service
shall be made available to customers on a voluntary basis. Residential
customers demand response service shall be available as defined in the by-laws
of the electric and communications division.
      (9)   Power cost adjustment. The Residential Rate Schedule "R" shall be
subject to a wholesale power cost adjustment which shall be computed by the
electric utility to be the average cost per KWH of the preceding month's
wholesale power purchase cost less $0.064/KWH plus 7% for system losses.
   (B)   Commercial electric service. Schedule "C" and "C3". Commercial
electric service shall be made available in accordance with the following
conditions and rates.
      (1)   Availability and applicability. Available and applicable for single
and/or three phase service for all non-residential use not specified in
Residential Schedule "R" (division (A) of this section) and for all service
where three-phase service is supplied to residential consumers. It includes

         (a)   Plus an additional charge of $7.25 “C” and $8.20 “C3" for each
unit of billing capacity in excess of 40 KW.
         (b)   All billings under the above rates are subject to the minimum
charge and other provisions hereinafter set forth.
      (3)   Monthly minimum charge. Where three-phase service is furnished, the
applicable monthly minimum charge shall apply on a year round basis of not less
than 12 consecutive months. Seasonal disconnection of three-phase service shall
not avoid the applicable monthly minimum charge. Where service is furnished for
charitable, philanthropic, non-profit, community activities (such as
governmental or tax supported athletic fields, swimming pools, fairs,
carnivals, and the like) the electric utility reserves the right to waive the
aforementioned minimum billing periods for which the minimum charge shall be
applicable. In such an event service shall be billed monthly and the minimum
charge shall apply only during those months that service is actually connected
or energized. The monthly minimum charge shall be not less than the highest
minimum charge as determined by any of the following methods:
         (a)   For single phase where capacity metering equipment is not
installed, the basic minimum charge shall be $18 under Schedule "C". For each
KVA of installed or allocated transformer capacity in excess of ten KVA the
basic minimum charge will be increased by $1 per KVA. Where capacity metering
equipment is installed, the minimum charge shall be $7 per unit of billing
capacity as determined hereafter but not less than the applicable basic minimum
charge as determined above.
         (b)   For three-phase service the minimum charge shall be $30 under
Schedule "C3" but not less than $1 for each KVA of installed or allocated
transformer capacity, nor less than $7 per unit of billing capacity under
Schedule "C3". Except as previously specified, seasonal or other disconnection
of service shall not affect or eliminate the three-phase minimum charges set
forth herein.
         (c)   For combined single phase and three-phase service the minimum
charge shall be the sum of the individual minimum charges as determined under
divisions (B)(3)(a) and (B)(3)(b) above but not less than $48.
      (4)   Determination of unit of billing capacity. The KW billing capacity
shall be the highest measured 15 minute integrated or equivalent thermal KW
capacity determined to the nearest KW by means of suitable metering equipment
but not less than 45% of the highest KW capacity so determined during the
preceding 11 months. Whenever the power factor is less than 90%, the electric
utility reserves the right to determine the billing capacity on the basis of
KVA capacity instead of KW capacity. The billing capacity applicable to Rate
Schedule "C" and "C3" shall be the KW or KVA capacity as determined above that
is in excess of 40 but not less than the minimum contracted.
      (5)   Other terms and conditions.
         (a)   The type of service available under Rate Schedule "C" and "C3"
will be supplied through a single set of service wires to a single meter
location. The voltage shall, at the electric utility's option, be either 120/
240 volt three-wire single phase service or 120/208 volt four-wire or 277/480
volt four-wire three phase service.
         (b)   When in the opinion of the electric utility, 500 KVA or more of
substation transformer capacity is required to supply consumer's existing and
probable future requirements, the electric utility reserves the right to
require consumer to make the necessary complete substation transformer
installation. In such an event the service will all be billed under the
provisions of division (C) of this section, with the consumer receiving the
substation transformer discount as set forth therein.
         (c)   All service shall be delivered through a single set of service
wires at a single location to be designated by the electric utility.
         (d)   For each service and meter location, the electric utility shall
render a separate bill for electric services used subject to minimum charges.
         (e)   Where the premises are used and occupied by a consumer as a non-
residential or commercial establishment and also as a residence or for farm use
as defined herein and where only single phase service is furnished, all service
shall be billed under Schedule "C". At the consumer's option, the wiring may be
separated subject to the electric utility's inspection and approval. Under such
conditions each class of service will be metered separately and billed in
accordance with the applicable schedules.
         (f)   Normally only single phase service is available by the electric
utility. Service will not be furnished to operate individual single phase
motors in excess of ten HP rating except where written permission is granted by
the electric utility.
         (g)   All motors ten HP and larger shall be equipped with reduced
voltage starting equipment or other control devices so as to avoid unnecessary
voltage surges on the electric utility distribution system.
         (h)   The electric utility may at its option furnish three phase
service only where such service is already available immediately adjacent to
consumer's property and only where it is practical and economical to do so.
Consideration to the investment required and probable use of three phase
service by consumer and where the consumer enters into an appropriate contract
that recognizes the investment involved will determine any line extension.
         (i)   The electric utility reserves the right to increase the minimum
period of service and/or to increase the minimum charge where an unusual
investment is required to furnish service as compared to the estimated or
probable revenue to be received.
         (j)   In determining consumer's classification for billing purposes,
any establishment carrying a business, professional, or commercial telephone
directory listing shall automatically be classified as being non-residential or
commercial in character. However, the absence of such listing shall not be a
determining factor in establishing that the service utilization is not non-
residential or commercial in character.
         (k)   Seasonal service. Only single phase service is available for
periods of less than 12 months with the minimum billing period to be not less
than four consecutive months each time service is established.
         (l)   Metering voltage. The electric utility reserves the right to
meter consumer's requirements in the most practical manner either at secondary
or primary distribution voltage and in either case the billing KWH shall be the
metered KWH.
         (m)   Definition of rural commercial service. Service in rural areas,
defined as areas outside city's corporate limits, shall be considered as
commercial in character where such service is not incidental to residential use
or general farming operations and/or where such service is used for the
preparation or processing of food or other products to the extent that same are
substantially in a form that they can be used or can be readily adopted for use
by, or for sale to, the ultimate consumer. All electric service supplied in
rural areas for activities, purposes or uses that, when carried on in urban or
incorporated areas, are considered and defined by the electric utility industry
as being non-residential or commercial in character, shall likewise also be
considered and defined as non-residential or commercial for all rural areas and
such service shall be billed under Schedule "C" and "C3".
         (n)   Temporary service. Temporary service shall be supplied in
accordance with the foregoing rates except that the consumer shall pay in
addition the foregoing charges, those charges specified in division (F) of this
section. A deposit in advance may be required to cover the estimated bill for
electric service plus the "up and down" costs of establishing the service.
         (o)   Use of service. Service under Schedule "C" and "C3" shall not be
resold or "submetered".
         (p)   The rates under Schedule "C" and "C3" are based upon and
dependent upon federal, state, county, municipal, and other government levies,
including gross receipts, income taxes, license fees and other impositions of
similar character in effect as of May 1, 2001. In event of an increase in rates
of existing taxes of this character or additional new taxes, licenses or fees
based upon generation, distribution, purchase and/or sale of the electric power
current or energy, shall be imposed upon or required to be paid by the electric
utility, the rates herein may be increased by a surcharge equal to the amount
of the cost per KWH, or per customer, or per demand or capacity or other
applicable unit of charge for such new or additional taxes, license or fees. No
adjustment shall be made due to variations or changes in the Federal Income Tax
Rate.
         (q)   Demand response service; Schedule "DR". Demand response service
shall be made available to customers on a voluntary basis. Commercial customers
demand response service shall be available as defined in the by-laws of the
electric and communications division.
      (6)   Power cost adjustment. The non- residential rate Schedule "C" and
"C3" shall be subject to a wholesale power cost adjustment which shall be
computed by the electric utility to be the average cost per KWH of the
preceding month's wholesale power purchase cost less $0.064/KWH plus 7% for
system losses.
   (C)   Large power electric service; Schedule "P". Large power electric
service shall be made available in accordance with the following conditions and
rates:
      (1)   Availability and applicability. The Large Power Service Schedule
"P" is available to all consumers located along existing electrical
distribution lines of the electric utility who use electric utility's standard
service for single or three-phase service and who guarantee a monthly billing
capacity to be specified by the service application or by contract but not less
than 500 KVA. Service under Schedule "P" will be furnished only on a 12-month
non-seasonal basis by contract in accordance with the following stipulations
and also be in accordance with the electric utility's by-laws and regulations
or subsequent revisions thereof which are on file with the Clerk of Council.
This schedule is applicable for all consumers' electric service requirements,
both single and three-phase, whenever supplied by the electric utility. For
single phase service only, Schedule "P" is an optional schedule available to
consumer upon written request for periods of not less than 12 consecutive
months. If, in the opinion of the electric utility, 500 KVA or more of
substation transformer capacity is required to supply consumer's existing and
probable future requirements, the electric utility reserves the right to
require consumer to install the necessary complete transformer equipment and in
such event this Schedule "P" shall apply (see division (C)(7)(a) this section.)
      (2)   Net rate per month of service.
         (a)   The total monthly billing shall be the sum of the following
charges:
 
                      Within Corporate Limits Outside Corporate Limits
First portion (capacity charge)
All KVA of capacity   @$9.75 per KVA          @$10 per KVA
Second portion (energy charge):
First 250 KWH per KVA @$0.0582/K WH           @$0.0631/KW H
Over 250 KWH per KVA  @$0.0525/KW H           @$0.0475/K WH
                      Includes the KWH tax    plus the KWH tax mandated by
                     mandated by the state   the state effective May 1,
                      effective May 1, 2001.  2001.
 
         (b)   The resultant billing as determined above shall be subject to
the minimum charge, discount for furnishing of substation, transformer, tax,
and other adjustments hereinafter set forth.
      (3)   Monthly minimum charge. The monthly minimum charge under Schedule
"P" shall not be less than $9.75 per KVA in city, $10 outside city, of billing
capacity nor less than $1,200 per month, nor less than the minimum charge
specified in consumer's service application or contract with the electric
utility. Said minimum charge shall have added to same any "special tax and
assessment adjustment" that may be applicable as provided in division (C)(7)(b)
of this section. The minimum charge is applicable on a 12 month, year round,
basis and seasonal disconnects will not avoid the applicable minimum charge
except as provided herein under "Determination of KVA Billing Capacity",
division (C)(4) of this section.
      (4)   Determination of billing capacity. The monthly KVA billing capacity
shall normally be determined by measurement by taking the highest 15 minute
integrated or equivalent thermal KW capacity and dividing same by the power
factor expressed as a decimal. The KVA capacity may also be determined, at the
electric utility's option, by means of other suitable indicating or recording
metering equipment; either continuously or by periodic tests made by the
electric utility at suitable intervals as determined by the electric utility.
Refer to division (C)(5) of this section for special provisions for off-peak
billing capacity. The power factor may be taken as the average monthly power
factor as determined by a ratcheted RKWH (RKVAH) meter or the power factor
occurring at the time of maximum capacity as determined by using the maximum 15
minute integrated or thermal KW and RKW capacities to calculate same or the
power factor as determined by means of periodic tests made by the electric
utility using standard metering equipment. Where highly fluctuating or
intermittent loads (such as welding machines, electric furnaces, hoists,
elevators, X-rays, and the like) are in operation by the consumer, the electric
utility reserves the right to determine the billing capacity by averaging
consumer's total load over a two minute period or by increasing the 15 minute
measured maximum capacity by an amount equal to 50% of the name plate KVA
capacity of the fluctuating equipment in operation by the consumer. Where such
fluctuating loads require additional or separate transformers or additional
system capacity, an additional separate capacity charge may be made and which
shall be based on a special study of the consumer's requirements. The monthly
KVA billing capacity shall be as determined above but in no event shall the
billing capacity be less than the highest of whichever of the following is
applicable:
         (a)   Forty-five percent of the highest KVA capacity measured during
the preceding 11 months but not less than the applicable minimum billing
capacity as specified in division (C)(4)(b) or (C)(4)(c) below, nor less than
500 KVA.
         (b)   Not less than the minimum KVA capacity as specified by the
electric utility and set forth in consumer's service application or contract
with the electric utility. In specifying said minimum contract capacity in KVA,
the electric utility will take into consideration the system capacity and
companion investment reserved in order to serve both consumers' initial and
contemplated future requirements.
         (c)   For service furnished to public schools and other governmental
use, the electric utility reserves the right to waive the provisions set forth
in division (C)(4)(a) and (C)(4)(b) above. In such an event and as long as
service is connected, the minimum billing capacity shall be as actually
measured but in no event less than 500 KVA. Where such service is furnished for
seasonal activities such as tax supported athletic fields and the like, the
minimum billing capacity and minimum charge may, at the option of the electric
utility, be waived during any regular billing period that service is
disconnected for the entire billing or meter reading period.
      (5)   Off-peak power determination of billing capacity. This subdivision
permits the establishment of billing capacity by measurement of coincidental
peaks of the electric utility and the consumer. This provision is only
available to the large power consumer where all of the consumer's requirements
are supplied at primary voltage, and who furnish, own, operate and maintain the
necessary complete transformer equipment required by the electric utility and
who contracts for a minimum billing capacity of not less than 1,000 KVA.
         (a)   The consumer shall install, under the supervision of the
electric utility, at their sole expense, suitable capacity recording measuring
equipment approved by the electric utility.
         (b)   The electric utility shall compute the billing capacity by using
the KW capacity coincident with the electric utility's billing peak during the
same period.
      (6)   Other terms and conditions.
         (a)   Where individual or unusual substation installations are
required to serve the consumer, the electric utility reserves the right to
require the consumer to install at consumer's expense, the necessary complete
system (consisting of transformers, structure, protective devices, etc.,
required to utilize service at the primary voltage designated by the electric
utility. The size, capacity and other specifications of such transformer shall
be determined by the electric utility and the entire installation shall conform
to the electric utility specifications. When the consumer owns, operates, and
maintains the necessary complete transformer, a discount of $0.25 per KVA of
billing capacity will be reflected in consumer's bill. However, the resultant
bill shall in no event be less than the applicable monthly minimum charge as
determined in division (C)(4) of this section.
         (b)   The rates under Schedule "P" are based upon and dependent upon
federal, state, county, municipal, and other government levies, including gross
receipts, income taxes, license fees and other impositions of similar character
in effect as of May 1, 2001. In event of an increase in rates of existing taxes
of this character or additional new taxes, licenses or fees based upon
generation, distribution, purchase and/or sale of the electric power current or
energy, shall be imposed upon or required to be paid by the electric utility,
the rates herein may be increased by a surcharge equal to the amount of the
cost per KWH, or per consumer, or per demand or capacity or other applicable
unit of charge for such new or additional taxes, licenses or fees. No
adjustment shall be made due to variations or changes in the federal income tax
rate.
         (c)   For each service or meter location, the electric utility
reserves the right to use either one combination single and three-phase meter
or separate single and three-phase meters. In such latter event the maximum
capacity and KWH readings will be added arithmetically and a single bill under
the above rates will be rendered to the consumer. The above rates are based
upon metering at the electric utility's primary voltage at consumer's premises.
The electric utility reserves the right to meter consumer's requirements at
secondary voltage, in which event the KWH for billing purposes shall be the
secondary metered KWH multiplied by 1.05 to allow for transformation losses.
         (d)   Secondary service available under Schedule "P" will be 120/208
volt four-wire or 277/480 volt four-wire three phase, or 120/240 volt three-
wire single phase service. As to the availability of three-phase service refer
to the electric utility by-laws and regulations. All service shall be supplied
through a single set of service wires. Any special transformers required for

round, basis and seasonal disconnects will not avoid the applicable minimum
charge except as provided herein under "Determination of KVA Billing Capacity",
division (C)(4) of this section.
      (4)   Determination of billing capacity. The monthly KVA billing capacity
shall normally be determined by measurement by taking the highest 15 minute
integrated or equivalent thermal KW capacity and dividing same by the power
factor expressed as a decimal. The KVA capacity may also be determined, at the
electric utility's option, by means of other suitable indicating or recording
metering equipment; either continuously or by periodic tests made by the
electric utility at suitable intervals as determined by the electric utility.
Refer to division (C)(5) of this section for special provisions for off-peak
billing capacity. The power factor may be taken as the average monthly power
factor as determined by a ratcheted RKWH (RKVAH) meter or the power factor
occurring at the time of maximum capacity as determined by using the maximum 15
minute integrated or thermal KW or RKW capacities to calculate same or the
power factor as determined by means of periodic tests made by the electric
utility using standard metering equipment. Where highly fluctuating or
intermittent loads (such as welding machines, electric furnaces, hoists,
elevators, X-rays, and the like) are in operation by the consumer, the electric
utility reserves the right to determine the billing capacity by averaging
consumer's total load over a two minute period or by increasing the 15 minute
measured maximum capacity by an amount equal to 50% of the name plate KVA
capacity of the fluctuating equipment in operation by the consumer. Where such
fluctuating loads require additional or separate transformers or additional
system capacity, an additional separate capacity charge may be made and which
shall be based on a special study of the consumer's requirements. The monthly
KVA billing capacity shall be as determined above but in no event shall the
billing capacity be less than the highest of whichever of the following is
applicable:
         (a)   Forty-five percent of the highest KVA capacity measured during
the preceding 11 months but not less than the applicable minimum billing
capacity as specified in division (D)(4)(b) or (D)(4)(c) below, nor less than
500 KVA.
         (b)   Not less than the minimum KVA capacity as specified by the
electric utility and set forth in consumer's service application or contract
with the electric utility. In specifying said maximum contract capacity in KVA,
the electric utility will take into consideration the system capacity and
companion investment reserved in order to serve both consumers' initial and
contemplated future requirements.
         (c)   For service furnished to public schools and other governmental
use, the electric utility reserves the right to waive the provisions set forth
in division (D)(4)(a) and (D)(4)(b) above. In such an event and as long as
service is connected, the minimum billing capacity shall be as actually
measured but in no event less than 500 KVA. Where such service is furnished for
seasonal activities such as tax supported athletic fields and the like, the
minimum billing capacity and minimum charge may, at the option of the electric
utility, be waived during any regular billing period that service is
disconnected for the entire billing or meter reading period.
      (5)   Off-peak power determination of billing capacity. This division
permits the establishment of billing capacity by measurement of coincidental
peaks of the electric utility and the consumer. This provision is only
available to the large power consumer where all of the consumer's requirements
are supplied at primary voltage, and who furnish, own, operate and maintain the
necessary complete substation equipment required by the electric utility and
who contracts for a minimum billing capacity of not less than 1,000 KVA.
         (a)   The consumer shall install, under the supervision of the
electric utility, at their sole expense, suitable capacity recording measuring
equipment approved by the electric utility.

Private street and security lighting electric service shall be made available
in accordance with the following conditions and rates.
      (1)   Availability. Available to any consumer including other political
subdivisions such as townships and the like, where the electric utility's
standard lighting unit can be installed on an existing pole and where 120/240
volt secondary or service wires are already installed so as to permit the
lighting unit to be installed without further extension of the electric
utility's distribution facilities. This service is also available where the
electric utility's street lighting circuits are available immediately adjacent
to consumer's premises. Where the installation of the lighting unit requires an
additional pole or an extension of the electric utility's secondary lines or
the installation of an additional transformer, the additional investment
required shall be paid for by the consumer. This service is available only
where there is reasonable assurance that the service furnished will be of a
permanent nature. The electric utility reserves the right to refuse to furnish
lighting service under this Schedule "SL" where the installation, in the
electric utility's opinion will not be of a permanent character. All
applications for SL service shall be in accordance with and conform to the
provisions of Chapter 50 through Chapter 56 of this Code and the regulations
adopted by the Director of Public Service and agreement form and the provisions
set forth in this Schedule "SL".
      (2)   Character of service. The electric utility will install, own,
operate, and maintain at its expense the necessary mast arm mounted lighting
unit and related appurtenances. The lighting unit will be photo-electric or
otherwise controlled so as to provide substantially year round dusk to dawn
lighting service.

      (4)   Minimum charge. This lighting service is furnished only as a
continuous 12 month year round basis. The minimum charge per unit is for 12
months and any disconnection of service will not avoid the minimum charge.
      (5)   Advance payment of annual charge. When in the opinion of the
electric utility, consumer's regular service is seasonal or non- permanent in
character, the electric utility reserves the right to require the annual charge
per unit be paid in advance before service is established and thereafter to
require advance payment prior to the commencement of each succeeding 12 months
of service.
      (6)   Payment and billing. The monthly charge per unit will be added to
the regular electric charge of consumer's bill and payment of same shall be
subject to the terms of payment applicable to consumer's bill for regular
metered electric service.
   (I)   Temporary and seasonal service.
      (1)   Whenever the service requested by the consumer is temporary,
special, short term or emergency, such service shall be considered as a
commercial temporary service. In such event, a written application or contract
will be required which will cover the period of service, character of service
and extra charges of the installation and removal of the required service
connection, transformers, and accessory equipment together with all material,
labor, insurance, transportation and other expense incidental thereto.
      (2)   Temporary service is defined as service required to be rendered for
a period of less than one year and includes service that is to be supplied to
installations, structures or buildings that are, in the opinion of the utility,
not permanent in character. Such temporary service also includes service
furnished to trailers, mobile homes, carnivals, street fairs, construction
contractors, portable tools and the like.
      (3)   (a)   Consumer shall pay a minimum construction charge of $200 to
pay for the initial establishment of temporary electric service as defined
above. The foregoing minimum construction charge only applies where not more
than a standard single phase service drop of not more than 100 feet is required
and where same will be incorporated and fully used as all or part of the
permanent service without loss of materials of consequence.
         (b)   Whenever additional construction in excess of said "Standard
Service Drop" is required for such temporary service and connections, all "up
and down" labor and material costs in excess of the foregoing service drop
construction charges shall be paid for by the consumer. Under such conditions,
consumer shall be required to make an advance deposit to cover the estimated
construction costs involved. Such deposit shall be paid before construction
work commences and upon completion any excess deposit will be returned to
consumer.
      (4)   Temporary and seasonal service shall be furnished in accordance
with utility's applicable schedule with respect to rates, minimum period of
time that service shall be paid for, monthly minimum charge, and the like.
   (J)   Special service charges. The following charges are applicable to
partially pay for the expense involved by the electric utility to furnish
special services requested or caused by the consumer.

     department of the city.
 
   (K)   Net metering rate schedule. Customers who generate a portion or all of
their own electric needs and provide any excess generation to the city's system
can receive a billing credit equal to the city's wholesale cost of energy,
adjusted to include line losses. This billing credit shall be provided to the
customer under a net metering rate schedule subject to the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Limitations. Billing under this schedule is limited to customers
who operate renewable energy source electric generating technologies. This is
defined as "energy generated by solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, including
waste-to energy and land fill gas, or hydroelectric." Biomass systems are
allowed to blend up to 25% fossil-fuel as needed to ensure safe,
environmentally sound operation of the system. A customer using biomass blended
with fossil-fuel as a renewable energy source must submit proof substantiating
the percentage of fossil fuel blend either by (a) separately metering the
fossil fuel, or (b) providing other documentation that will allow the city to
correctly apply a generation credit to the output associated with the renewable
fuel only. Eligibility for participation in the net metering program is limited
to customers taking bundled service (non-interruptible) from the city. The
eligible facilities must be installed on the customer's premises. The maximum
size of electric generators eligible for net metering treatment is 10 kW or
under for residential units and 200 kW or under for commercial or industrial
units. To qualify for this schedule, customer's generation systems will be
limited in size, not to exceed the customer's self- service needs. Non-
dispatchable generation systems (e.g., wind and solar) shall be sized not to
exceed the customer's annual energy needs, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
Dispatchable systems shall be sized not to exceed the customer's capacity
needs, measured in kilowatts (kW). If a customer has more than one generator,
to qualify for this schedule, the total capacity of the generators shall be
less than the maximum listed above. The city may restrict or deny service under
this schedule once the total connected generation provided under this schedule
equals or exceeds one tenth of one percent of city's previous year's peak
demand or 500 kW. The customer's facility must be in compliance with the city's
existing interconnection rules and regulations. For biomass systems blending
fossil-fuel, the generation credit shall apply only to the output associated
with the renewable fuel and exclude the output from the fossil fuel.
      (2)   Monthly rate. Deliveries from the city to the customer shall be
billed in accordance with the standard applicable rate schedules.
      (3)   Customer credits for net excess generation (NEG). Net excess
generation (NEG) represents the amount of electric generation by the customer
beyond the customer's own metered usage which is delivered to the city during
the billing period. Deliveries from the customer to the city shall be credited
at the following rates:
 
                Wind    Solar   Biomass
Summer On Peak  $0.0935 $0.0935 $0.0935
Summer Off Peak $0.0460 $0.0460 $0.0460
Winter On Peak  $0.0726 $0.0726 $0.0726
Winter Off Peak $0.0392 $0.0392 $0.0392
 
for power supplied to the city. The Summer Season shall be the months of June,
July, August and September and the Winter Season shall be the months of
January, February, March, April, May, October, November and December. On-peak
hours shall be Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. except for
New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and
Christmas Day. Off-peak hours shall be all other hours. The credit to the
customer shall not exceed the dollar amount the city bills the customer for
energy consumption in any billing period. Instead, the net excess dollar amount
shall be allowed to accumulate as a net excess generation (NEG) credit to
offset the customer's energy charges in the next billing period. The credit
will be adjusted based on the currently used power cost adjustment net excess
generation (NEG) credits, if any, will be carried over from month to month.
Following the customer's December billing cycle, the customer's credits balance
will be reset to zero. Any unused net excess generation (NEG) credits will be
retained by the city to offset costs associated with the operation of the net
metering program.

§ 53.02 TRUNK SANITARY SEWER EXTENSIONS.
   (A)   Benefit fee charge.
      (1)   Applicability. This benefit fee, hereinafter referred to as the
trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit fee, is to partially compensate
the city for the investment required to provide the necessary sanitary sewer
facilities required to transmit sewage discharged from sanitary sewer service
line connections to the city's sewage collector system and treatment plant
facilities sufficient to treat same.
         (a)   The trunk line facilities include, but are not limited to, main
trunk and interceptor sanitary sewer lines, lift station pumping facilities and
related appurtenances, but exclude local sanitary sewer distribution lines into
which sewage is normally discharged direct from service lines.
         (b)   Treatment plant capacity facilities shall include all buildings,
grounds, equipment and appurtenances necessary for the adequate treatment of
sewage as required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
         (c)   The trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit fee is, in
addition to any other benefit fee or assessment that may have been paid or is
applicable for local sanitary sewer distribution line facilities, as determined
by the Director of Public Service as not being part of the aforesaid main trunk
line facilities or treatment plant facilities.
         (d)   In the event that the Director of Public Service determines that
the land involved has been previously assessed or a benefit fee has been paid
for the same trunk line facilities, the applicable trunk line and treatment
plant capacity benefit fee as determined in division (2) hereof shall be
reduced by the amount of such previous payment. Such reduction shall not exceed
the benefit fee that would otherwise be payable as specified elsewhere.
         (e)   This trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit fee shall
apply to all land, lots, premises or buildings located inside or outside the
city's corporate limits, that are connected to the city sanitary sewer system
after the effective date of this section. Such benefit fee shall be paid in
advance before any tap or connection is made to the city's sanitary sewer
system or at the time a building permit is issued.
         (f)   All sanitary sewer connections shall conform to the city's
standards and regulations relating to same as specified by the Director of
Public Service.
      (2)   Determination of trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit
fee. The trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit fee that is payable
shall be determined by the Director in the following manner: by applying a unit
charge of $1,800 per unit for the direct or indirect connection of any
building, structure or other facility with a sanitary sewer which is or will
become a part of the sanitary sewerage system of the city in order for the
property or portion thereof on which such building, structure or other facility
is situated to bear its proportionate share of the cost of construction of
trunk sewers and treatment plant facilities. A unit shall be determined as
follows:

sanitary sewer system of the city until the trunk line and treatment plant
capacity benefit fee is paid in full and written permission is granted by the
Director of Public Service to connect into the sanitary sewer. Such fee shall
be paid prior to the issuance of any building permit.
('65 Code, § 935.03)
   (C)   Use of funds. All funds collected from such trunk line and treatment
plant capacity benefit fee shall be deposited with the City Treasurer and shall
be kept in a fund called Sanitary Sewer Tap Fund. The Fund shall be used for
the cost of the construction of trunk lines, over and above the cost of minimum
service distribution lines, for treatment plant facilities necessary to the
city sanitary sewerage system, and for appurtenant equipment and pumping
stations that may be required.
('65 Code, § 935.05)
   (D)   Deferred payments. The Director of Public Service may defer payment of
80% of the trunk line and treatment plant capacity benefit fee and 80% of the
connection charge (including any deferred tap in fee in an assessment
ordinance) for any owner of residential property that must be connected to the
sanitary sewer due to a defective septic system. The amount of payment deferred
shall be billed monthly for a period not to exceed 48 months until paid in
full. The amount to be deferred shall be secured by a promissory note and by a
mortgage on the property to be served by the connection. If an ordinance
provides for the tap-in charge to be paid to a third party who paid for the
construction of the sanitary sewer, the Director of Public Service shall pay
the third party the amount due at the time of the connection out of funds
appropriated for that purpose.

      (3)   Optional special metering for sewage billing purposes. For water
use that results in a clean wastewater discharge that does not enter city’s
sanitary sewer system (lawn sprinkling, irrigation, air conditioning, and the
like) such water will not be subject to city’s sewage charge providing the
following conditions have been complied with:
         (a)   That the Director of Public Service has determined that such
wastewater will consist substantially 100% of unpolluted or “clean wastewater,”
free from objectionable odor and will have no harmful or objectionable
polluting affect either directly or indirectly upon any streams, underground
water supply or other body of water into which such “clean wastewater” will
ultimately be discharged.
         (b)   That it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director
of Public Service that it will be impossible for the water usage in question to
discharge into city’s sanitary sewer system. To meet this requirement, such
unpolluted water must be discharged into city’s storm sewer system or into the
ground or into the street gutter or natural outlet. Furthermore, such water
shall not be discharged into any combination storm and sanitary sewer.
         (c)   That the property owner shall separate his plumbing so that the
water input that is ultimately discharged as “clean wastewater” will be
separately metered in order to determine the volume involved. The entire
plumbing and meter installation shall meet city’s specifications and approval
and shall be installed, owned and maintained at property owner’s expense. The
meter installation and location shall be specified by the city.
      (4)   Billing where the city does not furnish water service.
         (a)   Metered sewage service. 
            1.   At property owner’s expense, the city may require or property
owner may, at his option, elect to install a separately metered and plumbed
water system, to be approved by city that will accurately measure the water
input and resultant sewage discharge into the city’s sanitary sewer system.
            2.   In the event that said separately metered water input method
is impractical or not equitable, as an alternate plan, a suitable sewage flow
meter (to be specified by the city and installed at property owner’s expense)
may be installed which will meter the actual quantity of sewage discharged into
city’s system.
            3.   Under this plan, the foregoing rates and charges shall apply,
and the companion water service line size used to determine the “capacity of
Service” charge.       
      (5)   Other provisions and conditions. The installation, operation and
all other matters pertaining to sewers shall be subject to all of the
regulations, requirements and provisions set forth in the bylaws and

      (6)   Annual review of rates.
         (a)   The Director of Public Service shall at the end of each year
review the financial operations of the city’s sanitary sewage treatment
facilities and related matters and thereby determine if the revenues produced
by the foregoing rates and charges are proportionate and adequate to cover all
sewage costs including capital improvement financing.
         (b)   In the event it is determined that said rates and charges are
either not adequate or not proportionate, the Director of Public Service shall
submit to City Council for its approval a schedule of revised rates and charges
as will enable said system to be self supporting on an annual basis at all
times.

§ 55.08 PROPERTY CLASSIFICATION FOR STORM WATER USER FEES.
   (A)   For purposes of determining the storm water user fees, all properties
in the city are classified into one of the following classes:
      (1)   Residential property;
      (2)   Other developed property; or
      (3)   Exempt property.
   (B)   Residential property fee: The City Council finds that the intensity of
development of most parcels of real property in the city zoned residential is
similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to
determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such as buildings,
structures, and other impervious areas) on each such parcel. Therefore, all
residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat storm water
management fee, equal the base rate, regardless of the size of the parcel or
improvements.
   (C)   Other developed property fee: The fee for other developed property in
the city shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by
dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by one ERU.
The impervious surface area for non-residential property is the square footage
for the buildings and other improvements on the property. The minimum storm
water management fee for non-residential developed property shall equal the
base rate for residential property.
   (D)   No fee shall be imposed as to exempt property as defined in §
55.02.
(Ord. 05-088, passed 8-16-05)
§ 55.09 BASE RATE.
   (A)   The base rate has been calculated to ensure adequate revenues to fund
the costs of storm water management and to provide for the operation,
maintenance, and capital improvements of the storm water system in the city.
   (B)   The base rate for the storm water utility is $4.50/month/ERU.
(Ord. 05-088, passed 8-16-05)
§ 55.10 COLLECTION OF FEES.
   The fees imposed by this chapter shall be collected each month and shall be
separately set forth and billed together with each utility bill issued by the
city for property located in the city. Imposition of the fees shall begin with
October 2005 with the fees for October 2005 to be billed and collected by
inclusion with the utility bill issued in November 2005 and the fee for each
month after October 2005 to be billed and collected by inclusion in the utility
bill issued in the next month. Any fee not paid by the due date on the utility
bill shall be subject to a 10% penalty.
(Ord. 05-088, passed 8-16-05; Am. Ord. 05-109, passed 9-20-05)

comparable tier of service. This EBU method of estimating video customers is
consistent with the methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers
and is consistent with the methodology used by other multiple system operators.
Such uses shall require agreements for service to define minimum term of
service, installation charges beyond typical, ownership of wiring, programming
provided and costs of programming at the time of the agreement as well as
special conditions or charges.

thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required.
   (B)   The Police Department shall forthwith notify the registered vehicle
owner of the fact of such removal and impounding, reasons therefor and the
place of storage. Any person desiring to redeem an impounded vehicle shall
appear at the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity
and ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a release form, the
claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due for any fines for
violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or, as the court may
require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to answer to such
violations. The pound operator shall release such vehicle upon the receipt of
the release form and payment of all towage and storage charges.
   (C)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place
of storage without complying with the above procedure. Possession of a vehicle
which has been impounded and unlawfully taken from the place of storage, by the
owner or operator, shall constitute prima-facie evidence that it was so removed
by the owner or operator.

will not result in automatic denial of the permit; provided, that the applicant
shows reasonable grounds why the application could not be filed 72 hours in
advance.
   (C)   The permit may be refused or canceled if:
      (1)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the

convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
municipality.
      (3)   The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably
interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the municipality.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
      (5)   The information contained in the application is found to be false

reasonable conditions, including the hours, the places of assembly and of
dispersal, the route of march or travel and the streets, highways or portions
thereof which may be used or occupied.

§ 70.17 SPECIAL EVENTS AND STREET VENDING.
   (A)   The Director of Public Safety may establish by administrative
regulation a procedure for the issuance of special events permits to event
sponsoring organizations for special events to be held in the downtown business
district. For purposes of this section, the downtown business district shall
include the public right-of-ways of Broad Street from Lyman Street to High and
Main Streets, of Main Street from Mills Street to College and Broad Streets, of
College Street from Pardee Street to High and Main Streets and High Street from
King and Maple Streets to College and Broad Streets. The Director of Public
Safety may also establish by administrative regulation a procedure for
additional public right-of-way areas outside the downtown business district to
be used for parades whether or not the parade is incidental to a special event
to be held in the downtown business district.
   (B)   During the time period when a special event permit is in effect,
streets may be closed to traffic, parking spaces may be closed to parking and
street and parking lot vending may be permitted on public right-of-ways and
public parking lots in the downtown business district. Street vending shall be
subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Street vendors shall have obtained a street or parking lot vending
permit from the Director of Public Safety after providing such information as
the Director of Public Safety may reasonably require and subject to such
restrictions as the Director of Public Safety may reasonably impose. The permit
shall be for a specific location and shall not be issued unless the applicant
has received approval for the permit to be issued both from the sponsoring
organization of the special event and, if the permit location is to be on the
public right-of-way, from the owner of the land adjacent to the proposed vendor
location. For purposes of this section, the "owner of the land adjacent" shall
be the person or persons legally entitled to possession of the land.
      (2)   The specific locations for street vending permitted pursuant to
this section shall be limited to the following:
         (a)   If streets are not closed to traffic, street vending may be
permitted only on sidewalks and in parking lots.
         (b)   If streets are closed to traffic, street vending may be
permitted on sidewalks, parking lots, and traffic lanes.
         (c)   No street vending shall be permitted at any location that the
Director of Public Safety determines should be left available for the use of
emergency vehicles.
         (d)   All property of street or parking lot vendors incidental to
street or parking lot vending shall be removed from the permit location by the
time of expiration of the permit.
   (C)   No person shall engage or attempt to engage in street or parking lot
vending on public rights-of-way or public parking lots without a street or
parking lot vending permit from the Director of Public Safety. Whoever violates
this provision is guilty of unlawful street or parking lot vending, a minor
misdemeanor. If the offender persists in the aforesaid conduct after reasonable
warning or request to desist by a law enforcement officer, unlawful street or
parking lot vending is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require a permit for
merchants to use the sidewalk immediately adjacent to their own businesses nor
for the placement of newspaper sale boxes on the sidewalk, provided that the
movement of pedestrians on the sidewalk is not unreasonably impeded.

is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:

during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not

started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided

citation, or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code
listed in division (B)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

of this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111

vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar of the termination. The Registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (B)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         (b)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (B)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (B)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

the form of an endorsement, as determined by the registrar, upon a driver's or
commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a non-
certified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a non-
certified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if

pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02 (A)(7).

   (A)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same

immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right- hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the

that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

the visual signals or the stop warning sign in designated school bus loading
areas where the bus is entirely off the roadway or at school buildings when
children or persons attending programs offered by community boards of mental
health and county boards of developmental disabilities are loading or unloading

driver of a vehicle need not stop for a school bus approaching from the
opposite direction which has stopped for the purpose of receiving or
discharging any school child, persons attending programs offered by community
boards of mental health and county boards of developmental disabilities, or
children attending programs offered by head start agencies. The driver of any
vehicle overtaking the school bus shall comply with division (A) above.

more traffic lanes shall receive and discharge all school children, persons
attending programs offered by community boards of mental health and county

   (E)   No school bus driver shall start the driver’s bus until after any
child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child’s or person’s residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of
division (A) of this section is not permitted to enter a written plea of guilty
and waive the person’s right to contest the citation in a trial but instead
must appear in person in the proper court to answer the charge.
      (2)   In addition to and independent of any other penalty provided by
law, the court or Mayor may impose upon an offender who violates this section a
class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7). When a
license is suspended under this section, the court or Mayor shall cause the
offender to deliver the license to the court, and the court or clerk of the
court immediately shall forward the license to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
together with notice of the court’s action.

combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation
as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of

(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical

tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under §
73.011, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical
test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the
chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.

operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing

prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if

shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement

to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

73.012, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
      “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
   “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol in your blood, breath, or urine as set by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.012, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.

time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.012 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any

drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit him or her to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (B)   It is prima facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or

Devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         (b)   As used in this section, SCHOOL means all of the following:
            1.   Any school chartered under R.C. § 3301.16;

§ 74.44 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The

Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.

the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a
dangerous dog, and §
90.42 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the

the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a) in an amount
described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   The court may order the impoundment of the dog at the owner,
keeper, or harborer's expense in the city kennel pending the determination

to the provisions of § 90.40.

prevent further threat to the community from further release, running at large
or unavoidable escapes and to allow for testing for rabies and other disease,
if necessary.
      (8)   The court may order the destruction of any animal designated a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. Such order shall be carried out
only after an owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog subject to a designation as a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog has exhausted all appeals of the
designation decision. Costs of impoundment of the dog during the pendency of
all appeals and any cost of destruction of the dog shall be at the owner,
keeper, or harborer's expense.

dog pound at the owner's expense.

violation, if the permit holder, agent, or employee raises and proves as an
affirmative defense that all of the following occurred:
      (1)   A card holder attempting to purchase any beer, intoxicating liquor,
or low-alcohol beverage presented a driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
an identification card.
      (2)   A transaction scan of the driver’s or commercial driver’s license
or identification card that the card holder presented indicated that the
license or card was valid.
      (3)   The beer, intoxicating liquor, or low- alcohol beverage was sold to
the card holder in reasonable reliance upon the identification presented and
the completed transaction scan.
   (B)   In determining whether a permit holder or an agent or employee of a

this section, the Liquor Control Commission or the trier of fact in a court of
record shall consider any written policy that the permit holder has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of R.C. §§ 4301.22(A)(1)
or (2), 4301.63 to 4301.636, 4301.69, and 4301.691, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinances. For purposes of division (A)(3) of this section,
the Commission or trier of fact shall consider that reasonable reliance upon
the identification presented and the completed transaction scan may require a
permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder to exercise reasonable
diligence to determine, and that the use of a transaction scan device does not
excuse a permit holder or an agent or employee of a permit holder from
exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
      (1)   Whether a person to whom the permit holder or agent or employee of
a permit holder sells any beer or intoxicating liquor is 21 years of age or
older or sells low-alcohol beverage is 18 years of age or older;

commercial driver’s license or identification card presented by a card holder
is that of the card holder.
   (C)   The affirmative defense provided by division (A) of this section is in
addition to the defense provided by R.C. § 4301.639, or any substantially
similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   In any hearing before the Liquor Control Commission and in any
criminal action in which the affirmative defense provided by division (A) of
this section is raised, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles or a deputy registrar
who issued an identification card under R.C. §§ 4507.50 to 4507.52 shall be
permitted to submit certified copies of the records of that issuance in lieu of
the testimony of the personnel of or contractors with the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles in the hearing or action.

            1.   Removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures;
            2.   Making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions;
            3.   Abatement of any nuisance by the municipality or its agent
pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section.
         TOTAL COST. Means any costs incurred due to the use of employees,
materials, or equipment of the municipality or its agent pursuant to division
(A)(5) of this section, any costs arising out of contracts for labor,
materials, or equipment, and costs of service of notice or publication required
under this section.
      (2)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this
section may collect the total cost of abatement activities by any of the
methods prescribed in division (A)(2)(a), (A)(2)(b), or (A)(2)(c) of this
section.
         (a)   For each abatement activity in which costs are incurred, the
Clerk of the Legislative Authority of the municipality or its agent pursuant to
division (A)(5) of this section may certify the total costs of each abatement
activity, together with the parcel number or another proper description of the
lands on which the abatement activity occurred, the date the costs were
incurred for each abatement activity, and the name of the owner of record at
the time the costs were incurred for each abatement activity, to the County
Auditor who shall place the costs as a charge upon the tax list and duplicate.
The costs are a lien upon such lands from and after the date the costs were
incurred. The costs shall be collected as other taxes and returned to the
municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section, as
directed by the Clerk of the Legislative Authority in the certification of the
total costs or in an affidavit from the agent delivered to the County Auditor
or County Treasurer. The placement of the costs on the tax list and duplicate
relates back to, and is effective in priority, as of the date the costs were
incurred, provided that the municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)
(5) of this section certifies the total costs within one year from the date the
costs were incurred. If a lien placed on a parcel of land pursuant to this
division is extinguished as provided in division (A)(8) of this section, the
municipality may pursue the remedy available under division (A)(2)(b) of this
section to recoup the costs incurred with respect to that parcel from any
person that held title to the parcel at the time the costs were incurred.
         (b)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section may commence a civil action to recover the total costs from the
person that held title to the parcel at the time the costs were incurred.

this section may file a lien on a parcel of land for the total costs incurred
under this section with respect to the parcel by filing a written affidavit
with the County Recorder of the county in which the parcel is located that
states the parcel number, the total costs incurred with respect to the parcel,
and the date such costs were incurred. The municipality or its agent may pursue
a foreclosure action to enforce the lien in a court of competent jurisdiction
or, pursuant to R.C. §§ 323.65 to 323.79, with the Board of Revision. The
municipality or its agent may elect to acquire the parcel by indicating such an
election in the complaint for foreclosure or in an amended complaint. Upon the
entry of a decree of foreclosure, the County Sheriff shall advertise and offer
the property for sale on at least one occasion. The minimum bid with regard to
the sale of the foreclosed property shall equal the sum of the taxes,
penalties, interest, costs, and assessments due and payable on the property,
the total costs incurred by the municipality or its agent with respect to the
property, and any associated court costs and interest as authorized by law. An
owner of the property may redeem the property by paying the minimum bid within
ten days after the entry of the decree of foreclosure. If an owner fails to so
redeem the property, and if the parcel is not sold for want of a minimum bid,
the property shall be disposed of as follows:
            1.   If the municipality or its agent elects to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be transferred to the municipality or its agent as
if the property were transferred by all owners in title to the municipality or
its agent in lieu of foreclosure as provided in R.C. § 5722.10;
            2.   If the municipality or its agent does not elect to acquire the
property, the parcel shall be forfeited to the state or to a political
subdivision or school district as provided in R.C. Chapter 5723.
            3.   When the municipality or its agent acquires property as
provided in this division (A)(2)(c), the property shall not be subject to
foreclosure or forfeiture under R.C. § 323.25 or R.C. Chapter 5721 or 5723, and
any lien on the property for costs incurred under this division (A) or for any
unpaid taxes, penalties, interest, charges, or assessments shall be
extinguished.
      (3)   This division (A) applies to any action taken by the municipality
or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of this section pursuant to R.C. §
715.26 or pursuant to Section 3 of Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.
      (4)   (a)   The municipality or its agent pursuant to division (A)(5) of
this section shall not certify to the County Auditor for placement upon the tax
list and duplicate and the County Auditor shall not place upon the tax list and
duplicate as a charge against the land the costs of any abatement activity
undertaken under division (A)(2) of this section if any of the following apply:
            1.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been
transferred or sold to an electing subdivision as defined in R.C. § 5722.01,
regardless of whether the electing subdivision is still the owner of the land,
and the abatement activity occurred on a date prior to the transfer or
confirmation of sale to the electing subdivision.
            2.   The abatement activity occurred on land that has been sold to
a purchaser at sheriff’s sale or auditor’s sale, the abatement activity
occurred on a date prior to the confirmation of sale, and the purchaser is not
the owner of record of the land immediately prior to the judgment of
foreclosure nor any of the following:
               a.   A member of that owner’s immediate family;
               b.   A person with a power of attorney appointed by that owner
who subsequently transfers the land to the owner;
               c.   A sole proprietorship owned by that owner or a member of
that owner’s immediate family;
               d.   A partnership, trust, business trust, corporation, or
association of which the owner or a member of the owner’s immediate family owns
or controls directly or indirectly more than 50%.
            3.   The abatement activity is taken on land that has been
forfeited to this state for delinquent taxes, unless the owner of record
redeems the land.
         (b)   Upon valid written notice to the County Auditor by any owner
possessing an ownership interest of record of the land or by an electing
subdivision previously in the chain of title of the land that the costs of an
abatement activity undertaken under division (A)(2) of this section was
certified for placement or placed upon the tax list and duplicate as a charge
against the land in violation of this division, the County Auditor shall
promptly remove such charge from the tax duplicate. This written notice to the
County Auditor shall include all of the following:
            1.   The parcel number of the land;
            2.   The common address of the land;
            3.   The date of the recording of the transfer of the land to the
owner or electing subdivision;
            4.   The charge allegedly placed in violation of this division.
      (5)   The municipality may enter into an agreement with a County Land
Reutilization Corporation organized under R.C. Chapter 1724 wherein the County
Land Reutilization Corporation agrees to act as the agent of the municipality
in connection with removing, repairing, or securing insecure, unsafe,
structurally defective, abandoned, deserted, or open and vacant buildings or
other structures, making emergency corrections of hazardous conditions, or
abating any nuisance, including high weeds, overgrown brush, and trash and
debris from vacant lots. The total costs of such actions may be collected by
the corporation pursuant to division (A)(2) of this section, and shall be paid
to the corporation if it paid or incurred such costs and has not been
reimbursed by the owner of record at the time of the action or any other party
with a recorded interest in the land.
      (6)   In the case of the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation
that is the agent of the municipality, a notation shall be placed on the tax
list and duplicate showing the amount of the lien ascribed specifically to the
agent’s total costs. The agent has standing to pursue a separate cause of
action for money damages to satisfy the lien or pursue a foreclosure action in
a court of competent jurisdiction or with the Board of Revision to enforce the
lien without regard to occupancy. For purposes of a foreclosure proceeding by
the County Treasurer for delinquent taxes, this division does not affect the
lien priority as between a County Land Reutilization Corporation and the County
Treasurer, but the corporation’s lien is superior to the lien of any other
lienholder of the property. As to a direct action by a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien for the taxes, assessment, charges, costs,
penalties, and interest on the tax list and duplicate is in all cases superior
to the lien of a County Land Reutilization Corporation, whose lien for total
costs shall be next in priority as against all other interests, except as
provided in division (A)(7) of this section.
      (7)   A County Land Reutilization Corporation acting as an agent of the
municipality under an agreement under this division (A) may, with the County
Treasurer’s consent, petition the court or Board of Revision with jurisdiction
over an action undertaken under division (A)(6) of this section pleading that
the lien of the corporation, as agent, for the total costs shall be superior to
the lien for the taxes, assessments, charges, costs, penalties, and interest.
If the court or Board of Revision determines that the lien is for total costs
paid or incurred by the corporation as such an agent, and that subordinating
the lien for such taxes and other impositions to the lien of the corporation
promotes the expeditious abatement of public nuisances, the court or board may
order the lien for the taxes and other impositions to be subordinate to the
corporation’s lien. The court or board may not subordinate the lien for taxes
and other such impositions to any other liens.
      (8)   (a)   When a parcel of land upon which a lien has been placed under
division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(c) of this section is transferred to a County Land
Reutilization Corporation, the lien on the parcel shall be extinguished if the
lien is for costs or charges that were incurred before the date of the transfer
to the corporation and if the corporation did not incur the costs or charges,
regardless of whether the lien was attached or the costs or charges were
certified before the date of transfer. In such a case, the County Land
Reutilization Corporation and its successors in title shall take title to the
property free and clear of any such lien and shall be immune from liability in
any action to collect such costs or charges.
         (b)   If a County Land Reutilization Corporation takes title to
property before any costs or charges have been certified or any lien has been
placed with respect to the property under division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(c) of
this section, the corporation shall be deemed a bona fide purchaser for value
without knowledge of such costs or lien, regardless of whether the corporation
had actual or constructive knowledge of the costs or lien, and any such lien
shall be void and unenforceable against the corporation and its successors in
title.
      (9)   The municipality or County Land Reutilization Corporation may file
an affidavit with the County Recorder under R.C. § 5301.252 stating the nature
and extent of any proceedings undertaken under this division (A). Such an
affidavit may include a legal description of a parcel or, in lieu thereof, the
common address of the parcel and the permanent parcel number to which such
address applies.
(R.C. § 715.261)
   (B)   Injunction may be granted for failure to comply. No person shall
erect, alter, repair or maintain any residential building, office, mercantile
building, workshop or factory, including a public or private garage, or other
structure, within themunicipality unless all ordinances or resolutions enacted
pursuant to R.C. §§ 715.26 through 715.30 are fully complied with. In the event
any building or structure is being erected, constructed, altered, repaired or
maintained in violation of such ordinances or resolutions, or there is imminent
threat of violation, the municipality or the owner of any contiguous or
neighboring property who would be especially damaged by such violation, in
addition to any other remedies provided by law, may institute a suit for
injunction to prevent or terminate such violation. (R.C. § 715.30)
   (C)   Appropriation of property to rehabilitate; demolition or sale.
      (1)   In order to rehabilitate a building or structure that the
municipality has determined to be a blighted property as defined in R.C. §
1.08, the municipality may appropriate, in the manner provided by R.C. §§
163.01 through 163.22, any such building or structure and the real property of
which it is a part. The municipality shall rehabilitate the building or
structure or cause it to be rehabilitated within two years after the
appropriation so that the building or structure is no longer a public nuisance,
insecure, unsafe, structurally defective, unhealthful or unsanitary, or a
threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, in violation of a building
code or ordinance adopted under R.C. § 731.231. Any building or structure
appropriated pursuant to this division which is not rehabilitated within two
years shall be demolished.
      (2)   If, during the rehabilitation process, the municipality retains
title to the building or structure and the real property of which it is a part,
then within 180 days after the rehabilitation is complete, the municipality
shall appraise the rehabilitated building or structure and the real property of
which it is a part, and shall sell the building or structure and property at
public auction. The municipality shall advertise the public auction in a
newspaper of general circulation in the municipality once a week for three
consecutive weeks, or as provided in R.C. § 7.16, prior to the date of sale.
The municipality shall sell the building or structure and real property to the
highest and best bidder. No property that the municipality acquires pursuant to
this division shall be leased.

tenant or tenants, shall, as a courtesy to the owner of such property, attempt
to cause a written notice of said nuisance activities to be sent to the owner.
However, failure to prove delivery of such notice shall in no way prevent
enforcement of any provision under this chapter. The Chief of Police or his
designee, upon finding that three or more nuisance activities declared in
division (A) of this section have occurred within any six-month period at a
residential dwelling unit, shall cause a written notice to be served on the
owner of the property declaring that such property is a nuisance property. The
notice shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to
respond to and abate a similar future nuisance, and state that the owner may
avoid being charged the costs of response and abatement by taking steps to
prevent any further nuisance activities as set forth in this section. The
notice shall further state that if a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as
declared in division (A) of this section occurs within six months of the date
of the notice, the city may abate the nuisance by responding to the activities
using administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such
abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. Notice shall be served on
the owner personally or by certified mail and regular mail to the person’s
residence, regular place of business or last known address. If the certified or
regular mail is returned undelivered, a copy shall be posted in a conspicuous

address, or the property affected.
   (C)   If within six months of the date of the notice referred to in division
(B) of this section, a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in
division (A) of this section occurs, the city may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activities using administrative and law enforcement action,
and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the nuisance property. The
costs of such response and abatement shall be calculated as set forth in
division (D) of this section. Any further nuisance activity that occurs within
six months of a nuisance activity for which the owner has been given notice of
assessment may be charged to the owner.
   (D)   Cost of abatement shall be assessed per each nuisance in a six month
period and up to and including five nuisances by an assessment of a service fee
of $100 per each nuisance, by the Chief of Police or his or her designee. Each
nuisance in a six-month period in excess of five nuisances shall be assessed a
service fee of $200 by the Chief of Police or his or her designee.

property of the city’s intent to assess the costs of responses and abatement

      (1)   If, after a timely request for reconsideration is submitted, the
Chief of Police finds that the facts presented do not support the assessment of
costs, the Chief shall grant the request and rescind the notice. Otherwise, the
Chief shall deny the request.
      (2)   The property owner may appeal denial of the request by submitting a
written request within 30 days to the Chief of Police for a hearing before the
Board of Nuisance Abatement.
      (3)   A request for reconsideration or appeal shall not stay any actions
by the city to abate any nuisance activity.
   (G)   Board of Nuisance Abatement.
      (1)   There is hereby created a Board of Nuisance Abatement which shall
consist of the Director of Public Safety or his designee, the Chairperson of
the Public Safety Committee of City Council or his designee, and three members
of the community at large, appointed by the Mayor and subject to approval of
the Council. The members of the community at large shall serve for three years
and until a successor is appointed and qualified. Members shall serve without
compensation.
      (2)   The Board of Nuisance Abatement shall hear any appeals made in
accordance with division (F) of this section.
      (3)   Hearing of appeal. In any such appeal, the city must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the intent of the city to assess the property
for abatement costs is justified. The city shall not have to show that there
has been a conviction for a criminal offense to show the existence of a
nuisance. The city shall be deemed to have failed to have met this standard if
the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of evidence that:
         A.   He was not the owner at the time of any of the nuisance activity
that is the basis of the notice;
         B.   He had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and
vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of R.C. §§ 5321.17(C) and
5321.04(A)(9); or
         C.   He had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not, with
reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and upon
receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of R.C. §§
5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9).
      (4)   Any appeal from a decision of the Board of Nuisance Abatement shall
be made pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (H)   After final decisions on any requests for reconsideration or further
appeals have been issued and the costs to abate have not been paid within 30
days of the notice of such decision, the costs of abatement shall be reported
to the Clerk of Council, who shall mail a statement of the amount thereof to
the owner of the property.
      (1)   If after 30 days such amount remains unpaid, the Clerk of Council
shall certify the total amount of the expenses, the name of the owner of the
land and a sufficient description of the premises to the County Auditor, to be
entered on the tax duplicate, to be a lien on the land from the date of entry
and to be collected as other taxes and assessments and returned to the city
pursuant to R.C. § 731.54.
   (I)   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance,
or the assessment of costs by the city on a property, do not affect or limit
the city’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action, including nuisance abatement and assessment as provided by law.

§ 95.01 IMPOUNDING MOTOR VEHICLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (A)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to division (B) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (D) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section, PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY means private
property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a home,
residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The phrase
does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
   (B)   (1)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not
available at the time of the transaction.
      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (C)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicle's license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief's order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (A)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

storage pursuant to division (A)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
         (a)   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 or, if the vehicle

removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         (b)   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. § 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(D)(1)(b) of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (A)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         (a)   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         (b)   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (A)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the
procedures established by R.C. §§ 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (E)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other

4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (F)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (H) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.

misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (H)   Private tow-away zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         (a)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (H)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         (c)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (H)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow- away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.

section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (H)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   (a)   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         (b)   For purposes of division (C)(2) of this section, "personal
items" do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (D)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (E)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (F)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
§ 95.03 DISPOSITION OF VEHICLE ORDERED INTO STORAGE.
   (A)   An unclaimed motor vehicle ordered into storage pursuant to §

95.02 subject to one of the following:
      (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation

      (1)   The vehicle is left on private property for 48 hours or longer
without the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, on a public street or other property open to the public for purposes
of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road
or highway for 48 hours or longer;

   (B)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation
shall order any abandoned junk motor vehicle to be photographed by a law
enforcement officer. The officer shall record the make of motor vehicle, the
serial number when available, and shall also detail the damage or missing
equipment to substantiate the value of $1,500 or less. The chief shall
thereupon immediately dispose of the abandoned junk motor vehicle to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer as defined in R.C. § 4738.01 or a scrap metal processing
facility as defined in R.C. § 4737.05 which is under contract to the
municipality, or to any other facility owned by or under contract with the
municipality for the destruction of such motor vehicles. The records and
photographs relating to the abandoned junk motor vehicle shall be retained by
the law enforcement agency ordering the disposition of such vehicle for a
period of at least two years. The law enforcement agency shall execute in
quadruplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,

furnishes one copy thereof to the registrar, one copy to the motor vehicle
salvage dealer or other facility handling the disposal of the vehicle, and one
copy to the law enforcement agency ordering the disposal, who shall file such
copy with the records and photograph relating to the disposal. Any monies
arising from the disposal of an abandoned junk motor vehicle shall be deposited
in the General Fund of the municipality.
   (C)   Notwithstanding §
95.02, any motor vehicle meeting the requirements of division (A)(2), (3) and
(5) of this section which has remained unclaimed by the owner or lienholder for
a period of ten days or longer following notification as provided in §
95.02 may be disposed of as provided in this section.
(R.C. § 4513.63)
§ 95.05 PROHIBITION AGAINST ABANDONMENT OF JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE.
   (A)   (1)   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor vehicle
as defined in §
95.04 on private property for more than 72 hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, or on a public
street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of any road or highway for 48 hours
or longer without notification to the chief of a law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such
place.
      (2)   For purposes of this section, the fact that a motor vehicle has
been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in §§
95.01,
95.02 and
95.04 and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61 and 4513.63 shall invalidate the provisions
of municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
municipality.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing of
the abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(R.C. § 4513.64)
§ 95.06 JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE; ORDER TO COVER OR REMOVE; NOTICE; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   (1)   For purposes of this section, JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of §
95.04(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5) that is left uncovered in the open on private
property for more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the
right to possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk
yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of R.C. §§
4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a political
subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor
vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
      (2)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, and
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (B)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

of structuring to maximize that participation. In reviewing ownership
interests, the city will look with disfavor on proposals containing the

OFFICE OF A PUBLIC SERVANT includes, but is not limited to, a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)

misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2)(a).
         (b)   PUBLIC SERVANT has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is

      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation

      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.

      (2)   The amendment to division (A)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that

§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24)
§ 130.11 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance
      (2)   In addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to division (E)
(1) of this section for an attempt to commit aggravated murder or murder in
violation of division (A) of this section, if the offender used a motor vehicle
as the means to attempt to commit the offense, the court shall impose upon the
offender a class two suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege as specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(2).
      (3)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to attempted rape and
also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1418, 2941.1419, or 2941.1420, the offender shall be sentenced
to a prison term or term of life imprisonment pursuant to R.C. § 2971.03.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of

§ 130.13 PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE; PROOF OF OFFENSE; AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.
   (A)   Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of
the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the
evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof by a preponderance
of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense, defense of
another, or defense of the accused’s residence presented as described in
division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.
   (B)   (1)   A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another,
or defense of that person's residence. If, at the trial of a person who is
accused of an offense that involved the person's use of force against another,
there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used
the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's
residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or
defense of that person's residence, as the case may be.
      (2)   Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person is presumed to
have acted in self-defense or defense of another when using defensive force
that is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm to another if
the person against whom the defensive force is used is in the process of
unlawfully and without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle occupied by the
person using the defensive force.
      (3)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section does
not apply if either of the following is true:
         (a)   The person against whom the defensive force is used has a right
to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence or vehicle.
         (b)   The person who uses the defensive force uses it while in a
residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and without privilege to be,
in that residence or vehicle.
      (4)   The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this section is a
rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence,
provided that the prosecution's burden of proof remains proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
   (C)   As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case, the court shall
read the definitions of “reasonable doubt” and “proof beyond a reasonable
doubt”, contained in division (E) of this section.
   (D)   As used in this section:
      AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. An affirmative defense is either of the following:
         (a)   A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
         (b)   A defense involving an excuse or justification peculiarly within
the knowledge of the accused, on which the accused can fairly be required to
adduce supporting evidence.
      DWELLING. Means a building or conveyance of any kind that has a roof over
it and that is designed to be occupied by people lodging in the building or
conveyance at night, regardless of whether the building or conveyance is
temporary or permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes but is not limited to an attached porch, and a
building or conveyance with a roof over it includes but is not limited to a
tent.
      RESIDENCE. Means a dwelling in which a person resides either temporarily
or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
      VEHICLE. Means a conveyance of any kind, whether or not motorized, that
is designed to transport people or property.
   (E)   “Reasonable doubt” is present when the jurors, after they have
carefully considered and compared all the evidence, cannot say they are firmly
convinced of the truth of the charge. It is a doubt based on reasonable and
common sense. Reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt, because everything
relating to human affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt. “Proof beyond a reasonable doubt” is proof of such
character that an ordinary person would be willing to rely and act upon it in
the most important of the person's own affairs.
(R.C. § 2901.05)
§ 130.14 BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME.
   (A)   The municipality hereby declares that it recognizes both of the
following, in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”: that the syndrome
currently is a matter of commonly accepted scientific knowledge, and that the
subject matter and details of the syndrome are not within the general
understanding or experience of a person who is a member of the general populace
and are not within the field of common knowledge.
   (B)   If a person is charged with an offense involving the use of force
against another and the person, as a defense to the offense charged, raises the
affirmative defense of self-defense, the person may introduce expert testimony
of the “battered woman syndrome” and expert testimony that the person suffered
from that syndrome as evidence to establish the requisite belief of an imminent
danger of death or great bodily harm that is necessary, as an element of the
affirmative defense, to justify the person's use of force in question. The
introduction of any expert testimony under this division shall be in accordance
with the Ohio Rules of Evidence.
(R.C. § 2901.06)
§ 130.15 DELINQUENCY ADJUDICATIONS DEEMED CONVICTIONS.
   (A)   If a person is alleged to have committed an offense and if the person
previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or juvenile traffic offender
for a violation of a law or ordinance, except as provided in division (B) of
this section, the adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic
offender is a conviction for a violation of the law for purposes of determining
the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is
convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed upon
the person relative to the conviction or guilty plea.
   (B)   A previous adjudication of a person as a delinquent child or juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of a law or ordinance is not a conviction for
a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining any of the
following:
      (1)   Whether the person is a repeat violent offender, as defined in R.C.
§ 2929.01, or whether the person should be sentenced as a repeat violent
offender under R.C. § 2929.14(B)(2) and R.C. § 2941.149;
      (2)    Whether the person is a violent career criminal as defined in R.C.
§ 2923.132, whether the person has committed unlawful use of a weapon by a
violent career criminal in violation of R.C. § 2923.132 or should be sentenced
for that offense under that section, or whether the person should be sentenced
under R.C. § 2929.14(K) as a violent career criminal who had a firearm on or
about the person’s person or under the person’s control while committing a
violent felony offense and displayed or brandished the firearm, indicated that
the offender possessed a firearm, or used the firearm to facilitate the
offense.
(R.C. § 2901.08)
§ 130.16 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio river extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio river with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio river and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio river under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (I)   As used in this section, COMPUTER, COMPUTER SYSTEM, COMPUTER NETWORK,
INFORMATION SERVICE, TELE- COMMUNICATION, TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICE,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, DATA and WRITING have the same meanings as in R.C.

provider anywhere in Ohio. The remaining 90% of the proceeds or cash shall be
applied as provided in division (B)(3) of this section.

the program. If a citizens’ reward program that operates in more than one
county or in another state in addition to this state receives funds under this
section, the funds shall be used to pay rewards only for tips and information
to law enforcement agencies concerning offenses committed in the county from
which the funds were received.
      (6)   Any property forfeited under R.C. Chapter 2981 not be used to pay
any fine imposed upon a person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an
underlying criminal offense or a different offense arising out of the same

2907.22 or derived from the proceeds of the commission of a violation of R.C. §
2905.32, 2907.21, or 2907.22 and disposed of pursuant to this division (B)

§ 130.18 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by R.C.
§§ 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the Revised
Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under this
chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has discretion
to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and principles of
sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §§
130.99 or
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
130.99(C) to (G). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender’s character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender’s history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender’s conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim’s youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
130.99(B).
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
130.99(D), (E), (F), and (G). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
130.99(C) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
R.C. §§ 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(R.C. § 2929.22)
§ 130.19 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, R.C. § 2929.14(C),
or R.C. § 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §§
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. §§ 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. §§ 2903.06, 2903.07,
2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the
operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state
correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
§ 130.20 APPREHENSION, DETENTION, OR ARREST OF PERSON ON BOND.
   (A)   No person, other than a law enforcement officer, shall apprehend,
detain, or arrest a principal on bond, wherever issued, unless that person
meets all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The person is any of the following:
         (a)   Qualified, licensed, and appointed as a surety bail bond agent
under R.C. §§ 3905.83 to 3905.95;
         (b)   Licensed as a surety bail bond agent by the state where the bond

         (c)   Licensed as a private investigator under R.C. Chapter 4749;
         (d)   Licensed as a private investigator by the state where the bond
was written;
         (e)   An off-duty peace officer, as defined in R.C. § 2921.51.
      (2)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has entered into a written contract with the surety or with a
licensed surety bail bond agent appointed by the surety, which contract sets
forth the name of the principal who is to be apprehended, detained, or
arrested. For purposes of this division (A)(2), SURETY has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 3905.83.
      (3)   The person, prior to apprehending, detaining, or arresting the
principal, has notified the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the area in which such activities will be performed and has provided any
form or identification or other information requested by the law enforcement
agency.
   (B)   No person shall represent the person’s self to be a bail enforcement
agent or bounty hunter, or claim any similar title, in this municipality.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of illegal bail bond agent
practices.
      (1)   A violation of division (A) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (A) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be
prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   A violation of division (B) of this section is a misdemeanor of the
first degree or, if the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of division (B) of this section, or any
substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, a felony to be

(R.C. §2927.27) Penalty, see §
130.99
§ 130.21 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self- defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) to (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21)
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
130.18 or
133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §§
130.18 and
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B, and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance
involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the
violation, if the offender committed the offense in the vicinity of one or more
children who are not victims of the offense, and if the offender or the victim
of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis of
one or more of those children. This division does not limit the court in
requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any offense or in any
circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor

      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (G)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:

         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other

               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (G), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09 shall be fined by the

         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;

$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.09,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.

§ 131.19 VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(R.C. § 2913.61(B) - (E))

accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

transaction scan device does not excuse a seller or an agent or employee of a
seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:
         (a)   Whether a person to whom the seller or agent or employee of a
seller sells, gives away, or otherwise distributes cigarettes, other tobacco
products, or alternative nicotine products is 21 years of age or older;

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.101 CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The provisions of this
Chapter 151 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Wadsworth are enacted
pursuant to Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution and statutory
provisions that grant municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.102 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The provisions of this
Chapter 151 are based on findings of fact that the city has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, create health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and
governmental services, create extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impair the tax base. Additionally, structures that
are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes set forth in
Chapter 151, this
Chapter 151 has been adopted.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.103 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this
Chapter 151 to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding, which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (H)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (I)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (J)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (K)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (L)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.104 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this
Chapter 151 includes methods and provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.105 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   This
Chapter 151 shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the city as identified in §
151.106, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
city.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.106 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   For the purposes of this
Chapter 151, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Medina County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Medina County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective August 4, 2008.
      (2)   Other studies and /or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the city as required by §
151.403, Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (B)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the provisions of this
Chapter 151. Such maps and/or studies are on file at 120 Maple Street
Wadsworth, Ohio 44281.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.107 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   The provisions of this
Chapter 151 are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including
subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict
between this
Chapter 151 and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed.
The provisions of this
Chapter 151 shall not impair any deed, restriction, covenant or easement, but
the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.108 INTERPRETATION.
   (A)   In the interpretation and application of the provisions of this
Chapter 151, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   (B)   Where a provision of this
Chapter 151 may be in conflict with a state or federal law, such state or
federal law shall take precedence over the provisions of this
Chapter 151.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.109 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by the provisions of this
Chapter 151 is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or natural causes.
These provisions do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damage. These provisions shall not create liability on the part of the city,
any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on these provisions or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.110 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of this
Chapter 151 be declared by a court to be unconstitutional or invalid, such
decision shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any
part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
DEFINITIONS
§ 151.201 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in the provisions
of this
Chapter 151 shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these provisions the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal structure.

flood or 100-year flood.
   BASE (100-YEAR) FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number, from one
to three feet.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See “Lowest Floor” as defined in this
section.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally-assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded). Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the FLOOD
PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office; or
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the city's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCS are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, an LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including
basement, of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” as defined in this section, which is an unfinished or flood
resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage, in an area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is
built in accordance with the applicable design requirements specified in these
regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a “recreational vehicle” as defined in this
section. For the purposes of these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes
manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, any tract of land
upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked,
either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway,
building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of
the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). A Federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against
losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance
alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing
damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the
NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal
government that states if a community will adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all development in
special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make flood insurance
available within the community as a financial protection against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the “start of construction” as
defined in this section, commenced on or after the initial effective date of
the City Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 4, 1985, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state, and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the General
Assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's department, or any
court.

engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as “Area of Special Flood Hazard”, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS may also refer
to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal, state or local
sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood-prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. PERMANENT
CONSTRUCTION does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid

   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local Code Enforcement Official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 151.410 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD- CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in this
Chapter 151, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (A)   Development in floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in §
151.310(A);
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Wadsworth and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (B)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         (a)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         (b)   Division (A)(2)(a), (c), (d) and (e) of this section.
   (C)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood- carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
city, specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in §
151.310(A)(1)(c) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

(Ord. 08-033, passed 7-1-08)
§ 151.505 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (A)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought, shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (B)   Public hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
Chapter 151.
   (C)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (B)(1)(a) through (k)
of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond
one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the City of Wadsworth Property Maintenance
Code hereinafter referred to as "this code."
(Ord. 11-015, passed 5-4-11)
§ 152.002 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, and
general welfare in buildings insofar as they are affected by the continued
occupancy and maintenance of structures and premises. It presents minimum
maintenance levels of buildings and their equipment, facilities, and premises
required and specified by the city's official zoning, building and fire codes
and health ordinances. This protection is hereinafter provided by:
   (A)   Establishing minimum standards for maintaining the presentable
appearance of structures and premises; to avoid blighting effects of
substandard structures and premises and their negative impact upon the value of
surrounding properties; and to eliminate hazardous conditions.
   (B)   Establishing minimum standards for maintenance of basic equipment and
facilities, for light, ventilation, space, heating, sanitation, and safety from
fire in all structures which are now or may become substandard in the future.
   (C)   Fixing responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of
structures and their premises.
   (D)   Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
§ 152.003 APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Application. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all
structures which are now or may become in the future substandard with respect
to structural defects, protection against fire, maintenance of basic equipment,
adequate provisions for light and air, proper heating, sanitary conditions or
other conditions that otherwise constitute a menace to the health, safety, and
general welfare of their occupants. This chapter establishes minimum
requirements for the initial and subsequent occupancy of all buildings and does
not replace or modify requirements otherwise established for the construction,
repair, alteration or use of buildings equipment and facilities.
      (1)   Exceptions:
         (a)   State or federal government structures and properties.
         (b)   The provisions of this code shall not be mandatory for existing
buildings or structures designated by the state or local jurisdiction as
historic buildings when such buildings or structures are judged by the code
official to be safe and in the public interest of health, safety and welfare.
         (c)   Occupancies otherwise specifically exempted or not provided for
in this code.
   (B)   Compliance required.  Every portion of a building or premises shall
comply with the provisions of this chapter, irrespective of when such building
has been constructed, altered or repaired, except as hereinafter provided.
   (C)   Application of building code.  Any repairs, alterations of buildings,
or changes of use therein which may be caused directly or indirectly by the
enforcement of this chapter shall be done in accordance with applicable
sections of the building code.
   (D)   Application of zoning code.  Nothing in this chapter shall permit the
establishment or conversion of a nonconforming use in any zone except where
permitted by the zoning code, nor the continuation of such nonconforming use in
any zone except where permitted by the zoning code.
   (E)   Conflict of laws. Where a provision of this chapter is found to be in
conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety or health
ordinance or code existing on the effective date of this chapter, the provision
which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the
safety and health of the public shall prevail.
   (F)   Separability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause
or phrase of this chapter is declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such
decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter, which shall
continue in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of this
chapter are hereby declared to be severable.
   (G)   Saving clause. This chapter shall not affect violations of any other
ordinance, code or regulation of the city existing prior to the effective date
of this chapter, and any such violation shall be governed by and shall continue
to be punishable to the full extent of the law under the provisions of those
ordinances, codes or regulations in effect at the time the violation was
committed.

plan to create functional variations in the neighborhoods. Topographic maps
shall be utilized in the land planning.

   (D)   Major thoroughfares. Major thoroughfares shall be planned for
continuation of movement of fast traffic between points of heavy traffic
generation, and from one section of the community to another. They shall
contain as few intersections with minor streets as possible. Such thoroughfares
should traverse the community and should be spaced approximately one mile
apart.
   (E)   Collector thoroughfare. The function of a collector thoroughfare is to
collect traffic from minor streets and distribute it into major streets, and
normally contain a relatively large number of intersections with minor streets
and few with major streets. Collector thoroughfares should be spaced no closer

Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with
screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property
line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be
necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic. The Commission may require dedication
and improvement of marginal access streets or connection of parking areas along
major streets abutting commercial and industrial developments. Where a
subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or limited access
highway right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a street
approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations.

800 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround complying
with current Engineering Rules and Regulations.
   (K)   Intersection. Right-of-way lines at street intersections shall be
rounded with a radius of not less than 25 feet for major streets, 25 feet for
collector streets and 20 feet for minor streets. Chords or cut- offs may be
permitted in place of rounded corners. Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and comply with the current
Engineering Rules and Regulations.
   (L)   Street curvature (horizontal alignment). Street curvature shall comply
with current Engineering Rules and Regulations.
   (M)   Street jogs. Street jogs shall comply with current Engineering Rules
and Regulations.

be considered officially filed until it has been examined by the Planning
Commission at one of its public meetings and found to fully comply with the
formal provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Review by other public agencies. Upon receipt of the preliminary plat
application, the Planning Director shall submit copies of the preliminary plat
to other agencies for review and comments. The agencies to whom the plat is
submitted for review may include, but are not limited to the Engineering
Department, Director of Public Safety, Fire Department, Electric Division.
   (D)   Planning Commission action. The Planning Director shall submit a
written report to the Planning Commission together with the recommendations and
comments from the other reviewing agencies regarding the preliminary plat. The
Planning Commission shall have 90 days from the date the preliminary plat is
officially filed, unless the subdivider requests and is granted additional
time, in which to approve, approve with conditions or disapprove such
preliminary plat. The action of the Planning Commission shall be entered on the
official records of the Commission, including any recommendations, conditions
imposed, and the reasons for any approval, modifications or disapproval of a

other lands devoted to public use, the Planning Commission's final plat
approval allows the subdivision to be placed on City Council's agenda with
appropriate recommendations concerning the acceptance of dedicated streets and
alleys, or the vacation thereof, and of the acceptance of other public lands.
Final plat approval by the Planning Commission shall in no way constitute legal
acceptance of any dedicated streets, alleys or open spaces shown upon the plat.
      (2)   In the case of a subdivision not involving the creation of public
streets, utilities or lands, the Commission's final plat approval allows the
plat to be signed by the City Engineer and released to the applicant for
recording.

approval, the Planning Commission shall notify the Director of Law, who shall
prepare the necessary legislation for acceptance by City Council, of the
dedication of streets, alleys, land for public use or other public open spaces.
   (G)   Recording of final plat. After City Council's acceptance of the final
plat and associated public improvements and lands, the subdivider shall file
the approved plat in the office of the Medina County Recorder, after which lots
may be sold, leased or transferred. However, building permits shall not be
issued for lots in those subdivisions where the public streets and improvements
necessary to provide services to such lots have not yet been constructed. All
plats accepted shall be filed for record within 90 days after acceptance by
City Council. Failure of the subdivider to file an accepted plat for record
within such 90-day period shall void approval of such subdivision plat.

§ 153.052 CONDITIONS AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   No improvements shall be made unless and until all necessary plans,
profiles, and specifications therefor, and the preliminary plat, have been
submitted to and approved by the city and also the County Engineer, in the case
of lands outside the city. The improvements shall be of such sizes, capacities
and amounts as are required for the development of the proposed subdivision and
of extra sizes as may be necessary to serve nearby land which is an integral
part of the neighborhood service or drainage areas. The subdivider shall be
required to extend, or petition for the extension of, the improvements to serve
adjoining unsubdivided land. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission may require the
subdivider to construct, or petition for the construction of, off-site
extensions of the improvements. Procedures for providing any necessary public
lands, extra-size and off-site improvements and general standards for prorating
costs are set forth in §
153.053.
   (A)   General The minimum requirements which a subdivider shall be required
to make in a subdivision prior to approval of the final plat shall be as
prescribed in the foregoing provisions. All these improvements shall be carried
out in full compliance with the following: this chapter, or the regulations of
the state, county or city and the specifications for each of the various units
of work as required by the City Engineer, Director of Public Service, County
Engineer, and County Health Department, according to the nature of the
improvements.
   (B)   Grading. The subdivider shall grade, or petition for the grading of
each subdivision in order to establish street and sidewalk grades, floor
elevations of buildings, and lot grades in proper relation to each other, and
to existing topography and natural features within and adjacent to the
subdivision, such as existing roads, drives, walks, buildings, trees, ditches,
swales, channels, creeks, and the like.
   (C)   Streets.
      (1)   The type of thoroughfare required shall be such as meets the Land
Use and Thoroughfare Plan of the city. All street improvements shall conform to
engineering standards, details and specifications as set forth in the City
Engineering Rules and Regulations. All improvements shall be installed
according to the approved plans on file in the office of the City Engineer.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may consider variances to minimum right-of-
way widths and other improvements required by these regulations when the
development plan proposed clearly meets the design standards for such
subdivision and the variance is in conformance with §§
153.070 through
153.076.
   (D)   Curbs and gutters. Curbs and/or curb and gutters shall be Portland
cement concrete and shall conform to the specified typical in the Engineering
Rules and Regulations, which conforms to the specified thoroughfare type in
this §
153.052.
   (E)   Sidewalks. The location, width and thickness of sidewalks shall
conform to the specified typical in the Engineering Rules and Regulations,
which conforms to the specified thoroughfare type in this §
153.052.
   (F)   Storm sewers. All storm sewers and drainage improvements shall conform
to engineering standards, details and specifications as set forth in the Storm
Management Regulations, which is a part of the Engineering Rules and
Regulations. In addition:
      (1)   A storm sewer shall be designed and constructed as required for the
drainage area in which the proposed subdivision is located for the proper
drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot.
      (2)   Where a public storm water sewer is reasonably accessible, as
determined by the Planning Commission, the storm sewers to be constructed shall
be connected with such storm drainage system and such grading and such drainage
structures as may be required shall be provided.
      (3)   If the subdivision is in an area where a public storm water system
is not available, such grading and such drainage structures as may be required
to connect to downstream storm sewers or drainageways shall be provided.
      (4)   Whenever the construction of streets and necessary storm water
systems in a subdivision is such that direction of storm water flow is diverted
to affect surrounding properties, the subdivider shall obtain sufficient
drainage easements to provide adequate disposal of the storm water.
      (5)   The subdivider may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an
easement to the city for a drainage channel not less in width than required by
existing topography along the watercourse.
   (G)   Sanitary sewers. All sanitary sewers improvements shall conform to
engineering standards, details and specifications as set forth in the
Engineering Rules and Regulations, and the General Rules and Regulations
Covering the Control and Use of Sanitary Sewers and Treatment Facilities. In
addition:
      (1)   Sanitary facilities shall be designed and constructed as required
for the area in which the proposed subdivision is located for the proper
disposal of wastes for each lot.
      (2)   If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the extension of an
existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Planning Commission, a
system of sanitary sewer mains and lateral connections for each lot shall be
provided.
      (3)   If a subdivision cannot be reasonably served by the extension of an
existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Planning Commission, then
the Commission may permit the design and construction of an independent
sanitary system including a primary and secondary treatment plant and a house
connection for each lot, provided that such system is designed and the plant so
located that it can be integrated into future sewers planned or programmed for
the area and the temporary treatment plant abandoned when public sewers are
installed.
      (4)   If a subdivision cannot be reasonably served by the extension of an
existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Planning Commission,
individual septic tanks may be installed on lots of the size required by the
Zoning Code if soil percolation tests have indicated a reasonable useful life
for such disposal method. No subdivision consisting of more than five sublots
that intends to use septic tanks shall be permitted to platted within an area
around the city, located within one-half mile of city limits, without the
express permission of Council. It is the declared policy of the Planning
Commission and Council to discourage use of septic tanks within any area of
close proximity to the city to prevent pollution and future health hazards upon
the expansion of the city.
      (5)   The Planning Commission shall require the construction of sanitary
sewers and laterals for house connections, all of which are to be capped if the
construction of sewers is not planned or programmed for the subdivision.
      (6)   In addition to the above requirements, any subdivision not located
on a public sanitary sewer system shall submit plans to the County Board of
Health and meet regulations and licensing requirements of the County Health
District.
   (H)   Water supply. All water supply and distributions facilities shall
conform to engineering standards, details and specifications as set forth in
the Engineering Rules and Regulations, and the General Rules and Regulations

the area in which the subdivision is located and a supply provided for each
lot.
      (2)   Where a public water supply is within reasonable distance, as
determined by the Planning Commission, a system of water mains shall be
constructed and connected with such public water supply and connection for each
lot shall be provided.
      (3)   If a subdivision cannot be reasonably served by the extension of
the existing public water supply, as determined by the Planning Commission, the
Commission may permit the installation of a community water supply to serve
each lot.
      (4)   In subdivisions consisting of five or more lots, where public water
supply is not available, the subdivider shall provide for a test well for such
subdivision and provide the Planning Commission with evidence of adequate well
water for the subdivision prior to approval of the plat.
      (5)   No subdivision shall be permitted within 500 feet of the city
limits that intends to use water wells where city water lines would be
available upon proper annexation to the city by the land contained in the
proposed subdivision. It is the declared policy of the Planning Commission to
prevent future health hazards upon expansion of the city.
   (I)   Monuments. Centerline monuments and all property corners shall be set
in accordance with the State Minimum Standards set forth in O.A.C. Chapter
4733-37, the Medina County Engineer Survey Standards, and the current City
Engineering Rules and Regulations.
   (J)   Street trees. It is the intent of this chapter that trees are to be
planted in newly developed areas of the city. It shall be required that
subdividers plant trees along public streets in such manner, type and location
as approved by the Shade Tree Commission of the city. In lieu of planting such
trees, the subdivider may pay to the city the current fee, established by the
Director of Public Service, for each lot in the subdivision, based on the front
footage of the lot, including sides of corner lots. Such fee may be used for
the planting, care, replacement, trimming and pruning of street trees.

§ 153.053 OVERSIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS AND PUBLIC LANDS.
   The utilities, pavements and other lands and improvements as required and
set forth in this chapter shall be designed and constructed of such sizes and
capacities as required for the development of the proposed subdivision, and of
oversizes, additional capacities, and/or extensions to existing infrastructure
beyond the boundary of subdivision, as may be necessary to serve nearby land
which is an integral part of the neighborhood service and/or drainage area.
   (A)   Oversize improvements. If improvements in excess of the sizes needed
to serve just the proposed subdivision are required, the Commission may
require, as precedence to the approval of a preliminary plat and final plat,
assurances that such improvement extensions shall be provided as follows:
      (1)   (a)   If the Commission finds the over- size improvements would not
be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties, or as a
governmental expense until some future time, the subdivider may be required, if
he or she wishes to proceed with the development, to design, construct and pay
for the oversized improvements. Such improvements, upon final approval of the
Planning Commission, shall be available for connections by subdividers of
adjoining land. Reimbursement of the cost of the over-size improvement is
subject to Planning Commission and City Council approval.
         (b)   If reimbursement of costs for the over-sized improvements is to
be made, the cost to purchase the over-sized material, minus the cost to
purchase the material of the size necessary for the development, will be
reimbursed by the city. The cost must be requested in writing, and verified by
the City Engineer. The City Council will then budget the cost for the
subsequent fiscal year and make payment within a reasonable time frame within
the said year.
      (2)   The subdivider may petition City Council in accordance with §
153.039. The governmental body having jurisdiction may construct and pay for
the extensions, and assess the costs to the owners benefited. The governmental
body having jurisdiction may establish a rotary fund to pay for the development
costs, and not collect the assessments on the intervening land until it is
developed.
   (B)   Off-site extensions. If streets or utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Commission may require, as precedence
to the approval of a preliminary plat and final plat, assurances that such
improvement extensions shall be provided as follows:
      (1)   (a)   If the Commission finds the extensions across undeveloped
areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening
properties, or a governmental expense, until some future time, the subdivider
may be required, if he or she wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain
necessary easements or rights-of-way and design, construct and pay for
extensions. Such improvements, upon approval of the Planning Commission, shall
be available for connections by subdividers of adjoining land.
         (b)   The cost of construction of the off- site improvement may be
reimbursed at the current rate for the improvement as provided for in §
53.02(A)(3) or §
54.16(B). The cost must be requested in writing. The City Engineer will prepare
an ordinance stating the adjoining parcels that benefit from the improvement.
The fees will be collected at the current rate stated in the ordinance at the
time of connection and reimbursed to the subdivider within a reasonable time
frame.
      (2)   The subdivider may petition City Council in accordance with §
153.039. The governmental body having jurisdiction may construct and pay for
the extensions, and assess the costs to the owners benefited. The governmental
body having jurisdiction may establish a rotary fund to pay for the development
costs and not collect the assessments on the intervening land until it is
developed.
   (C)   Prorating costs. In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or oversize improvements, the Commission
shall consider, in addition to the standards set forth in this section and
other regulations of the state, county or city, the following conditions:
      (1)   The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision;
      (2)   The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in
relation to present streets;
      (3)   The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for
water;
      (4)   The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision;
      (5)   The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity;
      (6)   Any other condition it may find pertinent.
   (D)   Land reserved for public use.
      (1)   The subdivider of every parcel of land within the corporate limits,
or otherwise within the jurisdiction of this chapter, which is subdivided for
residential purposes shall be required to provide land to satisfy that portion
of the future demand for public parks accruing to the subdivider’s land. Park
land provided shall be based on a ratio of .035 acres of additional park land
per dwelling unit. For a subdivision within the corporation limits the city may
require a cash payment in lieu of such land dedication which shall be at a rate
of $400 per new residential dwelling unit, whether single-family, two-family,
or multiple-family. Such payment shall be made to the city, deposited in a
special account and used exclusively for the acquisition of land for park
purposes as determined by Council. This land dedication, or applicable fee
payment in lieu of the land dedication, applies to all locations, regardless of
whether the proposed development coincides with any park land shown on the
city’s Parks and Recreation Plan or the city’s Thoroughfare Plan, and shall
apply to all projects regardless of the number of dwelling units which are
proposed per acre.
      (2)   City Council, when applicable, shall have the sole discretion of
accepting the land, the fee in lieu of the land, or land and fee in combination
on any proportional basis it deems appropriate based on the size of the
potential land area, the location of the proposed development and the park
needs of the city.
      (3)   This land dedication, or an equivalent fee in lieu of the land
dedication, is required in addition to:
         (a)   Any open land otherwise required for retention basins,
easements, and the like.
         (b)   Land set aside to meet the minimum open space requirements for
planned unit developments, or other land uses, and the like.
         (c)   Land set aside for parks and open space at the discretion of the
subdivider.
         (d)   Any other land which City Council determines is otherwise
unbuildable, such as but not limited to, steep slopes, wetlands and streams and
which City Council further determines would remain as open space if the city
did not have park dedication requirements as regulated herein.
      (4)   When reviewing the preliminary plat pursuant to §
153.037, the Planning Commission shall determine as part of such approval and
make a recommendation to City Council, the amount and location of land which
should be dedicated for parks, or the fee that should be paid in lieu of the
land dedication, or the proportional combination of land and fee which is
appropriate for the proposed subdivision.
      (5)   Any fee required shall be paid to the city by the subdivider prior
to approval of the final plat for the entire subdivision, or each phase thereof
pursuant to §
153.039. Such payment shall be deposited in a special account and shall be used
exclusively for park land acquisition as determined by City Council.

93; Am. Ord. 07-101, passed 10-3-07; Am. Ord. 08-026, passed 6-3-08)
§ 153.054 REVIEWS, INSPECTIONS AND FEES.
   (A)   Reviews.
      (1)   At the time such plans, profiles and specifications are submitted
for engineering review, the Director of Public Service should prepare an
estimate of cost for office checking of all improvements based on the schedule
in §
153.054(C), and §
153.054(D)(2). The hourly rate for engineering will be determined by the
Director of Public Service by January 31 of each year. The applicant should
thereupon deposit an amount of money equal to such estimated cost, and all work
done by the Engineer in connection with checking, computing and correcting such
plans of improvements should be charged against such deposit. If, during the
progress of the work, it should appear that the cost thereof will exceed any
amount so deposited, the Director of Public Service should notify the applicant
of this fact and should do no further work in connection with such review until
the applicant has deposited such additional sum of money necessary to cover the
cost of the work. The Director of Public Service shall refund all fees paid
subsequent to February 17, 2005 to the extent that the estimated cost and
deposit exceeds actual work completed for engineering review and inspection of
public or private improvements.
      (2)   The approving agency should within 30 days of receipt of a plan
indicate its approval or disapproval to the applicant. Indication of
disapproval should include the plan deficiencies and the procedure for filing a
revised plan. Earth disturbing activities may be allowed to proceed in
accordance with conditions outlined by the approving agency pending the
preparation and approval of the revised plan. A plan, once approved, may be
amended by the approving agency at the request of the applicant, if such
amendment satisfies the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Inspections. The City Engineer or his designee should make inspections
during the installation of improvements to ensure conformity with the approved
plans and specifications as contained in the applicant's contract. Prior to
construction, the Director of Public Service should prepare an estimate of cost
for inspection of all improvements based on the schedule in §
153.054(C), and §
153.054(D)(2). The hourly rate for inspection will be determined by the
Director of Public Service by January 31 of each year. The applicant should
thereupon deposit an amount of money equal to such estimated cost, and all work
done by the Engineer in connection with inspection of improvements should be
charged against such deposit. If, during the progress of the work, it should
appear that the cost thereof will exceed any amount so deposited, the Director
of Public Service should notify the applicant of this fact and construction of
all improvements requiring inspection will be ordered to cease until the
applicant has deposited such additional sum of money necessary to cover the
cost of the work. The applicant should notify the proper administrative
officials when each phase of the improvement is ready for inspection.
   (C)   Engineering and Inspection Hourly Schedule. The following schedule
should be used to determine the hours for each phase of a subdivision submitted
for review and inspection, as required in §
153.054(A)(1) and §
153.054(B)(1):
      (1)   Engineering   5 hours + 4 hours per lot.
      (2)   Inspections   50 hours + 8 hours per lot.
   (D)   (1)   The Director of Public Service may reduce from the above
schedule due to the installation of required public improvements constructed in
prior phases upon recommendation of the City Engineer.
      (2)   For developments that require offsite improvements, a fee estimated
by the City Engineer will be charged for engineering and inspection of such off
site improvements. The City Engineer shall also reduce deposit fees associated
with projects which include public improvements which are the responsibility of
other jurisdictions, or projects that are determined by the City Engineer to
require minimal plan reviews or inspections. The following schedule should be
used to determine the hours for any offsite utility improvement submitted for
review and inspection:
      (1)   Engineering   10 hours + 0.5 hours per 100 linear feet (l.f.)
      (2)   Inspections   50 + 1.5 hours per 100 linear feet (l.f.)
      (3)   For subdivisions that are located out of the city that require
sanitary sewer improvements, a fee estimated by the City Engineer will be
charged for engineering and inspection.
      (4)   The Director of Public Service may reduce from the schedule in §
153.054(C) and §
153.054(D)(2)(a) due to the complexity and scope of the project. To determine
this reduction, the schedules in §
153.054(C) and §
153.054(D)(2)(a) will be used as the baseline calculation for the deposit.
      (5)   The City Engineer will then determine if any of the ten possible
baseline deductions as defined in the Engineering Rules and Regulations apply
to the project. Nine of these baseline deductions have a 5% value each, and the
last baseline deduction-stormwater management will have a 40% reduction value.
A maximum 85% deduction to the baseline deposit could be obtained if the City
Engineer determines that all ten baseline deductions apply.
   (E)   Non-payment of fees. If the applicant, subject to any of the fees
imposed by §
153.054, fails to pay said fees as required, the City Auditor may pursue a
civil action to collect said fees. In addition, the use of such plans, profiles
and specifications subject to the fees and for which the fees have not been
paid, shall be deemed disapproved until all fees are paid in full and the
plans, profiles and specifications are approved by the appropriate agency.

§ 153.055 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE BONDS AND MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Guarantees of installation. The developer may execute and file with
the city or county financial guarantees in lieu of actual installation or
completion of the required improvements concurrently with the application for
approval of the final plat. Such guarantees may be in the form of a performance
surety bond, a certified check or an escrow check or escrow account shall be
approved by the Director of Public Service and form of the surety bond or
escrow agreement shall be approved by the Director of Law.
   (B)   Terms. Guarantees of installation shall not be for a longer period
than two years, unless Council or the County Commissioners, by ordinance or
resolution, extend the time. Bonds shall be executed by the applicant as
principal with a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Ohio.
The performance surety bond certified check or escrow deposit shall be
conditioned that the developer will faithfully discharge all requirements of
this chapter and install all required improvements, and faithfully pay all
laborers, materialmen and contractors or subcontractors that are directly
involved in the subdivision improvements so that no mechanic's liens of any
type or nature are filed or asserted against or for the improvements herein
required, and that if the city or county performs work or service for the
developer at his request, that the city or county will be faithfully paid for
all work, services, materials and equipment furnished such developer. Such bond
shall run for the benefit of the city and county, and in addition thereto, to
all laborers, materialmen, subcontractors and contractor furnishing labor,
equipment or materials or other services on such improvements, and to any owner
of lots in the subdivision who may purchase such lots from the developer or his
assigns, and any beneficiary of such bond shall have a legal right to press a
claim or suit against such bond or deposit.
   (C)   Amount of guarantee. The financial guarantees for installation shall
be in an amount equal to the estimated total cost of materials and labor
required to install or construct the improvements, plus 10% contingencies. Such
costs shall be determined by the City or County Engineer. When any portion of
an improvement has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily completed, a
reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds may be authorized upon
receipt of lien waivers or releases.
   (D)   Progressive installation. The developer may apply for final approval
recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such a progressive
unit development procedure, the installation of required improvements and sale
or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the subdivision which has
been approved and recorded.
   (E)   Failure to complete improvements. In the event the developer fails to
complete or pay for the installation of all land improvements according to the
terms and conditions of the agreement, the city or county may complete the same
and appropriate such portion of the money or bonds posted for the faithful
performance of such work, and the payment thereof.
   (F)   Assurance of performance. Any bond tendered to meet the requirements
of this chapter shall affirmatively state that the surety will assure
performance of division (B) above. Notwithstanding any omissions or conflicts
in the written bonds tendered by developers to meet the requirements of the
bonds, all bonds shall be construed to grant the protection stated in division
(B), and all sureties written and tendering bonds to the city or county shall
be bound by the provisions of this chapter and the duties required of
developers.
   (G)   Guarantees of maintenance. The developer or the developer's general
contractor shall guarantee the construction and materials of the improvements
for a two-year period after acceptance by the city or county via a recorded
plat. In order to secure the guarantee, the developer or the developer's
general contractor shall deposit an amount equal to 5% of the total cost of the
construction of the improvements in a maintenance fund, or post a maintenance
surety bond for such amount, which shall be done concurrently with filing the
performance and payment bond required herein. The two-year maintenance
guarantee period shall commence upon the date of recordation of the final plat.
   (H)   Trench settlement guarantee. The developer or the developer's general
contractor shall provide a surety bond or escrow account in the amount of 3% of
the total cost of pavement in order to assure repair of any damage to the
streets, which may occur within three years from the date of recordation of the
final plat by reason of trench settlement.
   (I)   Termination of improvements before boundary. Streets and other public
improvements may be terminated at a minimum distance of 10 feet from the
boundary of the subdivision or at a greater distance as may be determined by
the Director of Public Service based upon grading or other site conditions that
would make installation of these improvements to the property boundary
impractical. Financial guarantees for performance, maintenance and trench
settlement shall not be required for those improvements that have not been
constructed within the approved termination area as these improvements will be
installed in the future by the developer of the adjacent property. The
remaining streets and other public improvements outside of the termination area
shall be constructed or financially guaranteed as described elsewhere in this
section.

§ 153.056 IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT.
   In lieu of the forms of guarantee authorized by §
153.055, a developer may instead enter into an agreement to install, complete
and pay for improvements on a schedule agreeable to the Director of Public
Service and secure performance of the agreement with an irrevocable letter of
credit as a financial guarantee in lieu of actual installation or completion of
required improvements concurrently with the application for approval of a final
plat. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued by a bank or other
lending institution that is authorized by this state or the United States to
issue such letter of credit and has an office in the State of Ohio. The letter
of credit shall be issued for the benefit of the City of Wadsworth and may be
drawn upon if the developer fails to timely complete or pay for the
installation of the required improvements. The City of Wadsworth may then
complete the same and use the money drawn under the letter of credit for the
performance of such work and the payment thereof. The amount of the letter of
credit and the completion times in the agreement shall be specified by the
Director of Public Service and the form of the documents shall be subject to
approval by the Director of Law.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The City of Wadsworth originated as a farm trade and service center,
expanded because of coal mining, the railroad and industries prior to World War
II and then further expanded because of the dominant use of the motor vehicle
after World War II. Today the city functions as a shopping center and
industrial core and also as a living area for workers of nearby communities.
The city is strategically located in respect to the major highways of U.S. 224/
76 to the north and U.S. 21 to the east and also is within the area of
influence of the expanding metropolitan region of the City of Akron. These
factors deem it inevitable that future expansion of residential, commercial and
industrial land uses will occur.
   (B)   It is essential to the well-being of the area that such development
shall take place in an orderly manner so as to place no undue burden upon
developers, industry, commerce or residences. It is the purpose of the zoning
code in this chapter to provide for that orderly development; to assure the
provision of adequate sites for industry, commerce or residences; to provide
for free movement of vehicles upon the proper streets and highways of the area;
to protect industry, commerce and residences against incompatible uses of land;
to assure the provision of adequate space for the parking of vehicles of
customers using the commercial, retail and industrial areas. In addition to the
above, it is recognized that it is the purpose of industry and commerce to
provide the means for decent and respectable lives for the citizens of a
community. In the interests of public health, safety, morals and the general
welfare, it is essential that all districts be considered equal since all
districts perform equally important within the community and that all districts
be adequately protected in order to enable them to best perform their function
within the community. It is also essential that all of the uses of land and
buildings within the city be so related as to provide for economy in government
and so that they may mutually support each other in order that the fullest
benefit may be derived from industrial, commercial and living areas.

('65 Code, § 1321.05)
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS
§ 154.030 GENERAL REGULATIONS - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this subchapter to recognize
and accommodate creative and imaginative, "master-planned" or unified
residential developments which utilize innovations in technology and best
practices in land development that are in the best interest of the city and
which are consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's Comprehensive
Plan of current adoption. These regulations are designed to achieve, among
other things, the following objectives:
      (1)   To promote flexibility in site design, lot sizes and yard
requirements in order to conserve open space, preserve natural amenities and
environmentally sensitive areas and to direct development to more appropriate
locations.
      (2)   To provide readily accessible green spaces and recreational areas
within the development and to provide for pedestrian and non-motorized
vehicular access to and through such common open areas.
      (3)   To allow for a variety of dwelling types including attached and
detached single-family and multiple-family dwellings that are compatible with
the purpose of this chapter; the underlying zoning district and neighboring
developments.
      (4)   To create compact and walkable neighborhoods and provide a
reasonable separation between motor vehicle and pedestrian and other non-
motorized traffic.
      (5)   To provide appropriate vehicular and pedestrian connections between
the development and adjacent neighborhoods and nearby commercial uses.
      (6)   To promote a more efficient use of land than is generally achieved
through conventional subdivision development, which may reduce initial
development costs as well as long-term public maintenance costs, through
construction of shorter streets and utility mainlines.
   (B)   Special provisions governing PUDs. Because of the unique
characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions governing the
development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there is a conflict
or difference between the provisions of this section and those of the other
chapters of the zoning ordinance, the provisions of this division shall
prevail. Subjects not covered by this division shall be governed by the
respective provisions found elsewhere in this code. Except as specifically
noted, nothing in this section shall be interpreted to exempt PUDs from all
provisions of the subdivision regulations of the city. All PUDs are subject to
site plan review by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Minimum project area.
         (a)   The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a PUD shall
be a minimum of 25 acres. Smaller parcels may be considered for approval as a
PUD on the basis of their potential to meet the objectives of this division as
stated in division (A) of this section.
         (b)   All land within the PUD shall be contiguous in that it shall not
be divided into segments by any limited-access highway or any tract of land
(other than public streets, rights-of-way for pipelines, electric or other
utility transmission lines) not owned or under control of the developer of the
PUD.
         (c)   All land proposed for a PUD shall be located in an LDR, R-1 or
R-2 Residential zoning district.
      (2)   Accessibility.
         (a)   Collector streets and major thoroughfares. In order to maintain
efficient traffic circulation, one-, two- and three-family dwellings shall not
be accessed directly from a collector or major thoroughfare unless the PUD
includes a marginal access road adjacent to the collector or major thoroughfare
for such purpose, which is approved by the Planning Commission.
         (b)   Private streets. Private streets are permitted with condominium,
cluster housing and multi-family developments within the planned unit
development and shall be designed to the standards adopted by the city in the
most current version of the Engineering Rules and Regulations.
         (c)   Pedestrian and bicycle circulation. The layout of all public and
private streets shall be designed with consideration given to "complete
streets" principles in order to accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists in a
safe manner.
      (3)   Permitted uses.
         (a)   Permitted uses in a PUD shall consist of:
            1.   Detached single-family dwellings in LDR and R-1 zoning
districts.
            2.   Attached and detached single-family dwellings and two-family
attached dwellings in R-2 districts.
            3.   Accessory uses or structures incidental to the primary or
principal structure or use. Accessory uses or structures shall not include any
activity conducted as a business.
            4.   Off-street parking subject to §§
154.405 through
154.409.
            5.   Signs subject to §§
154.470 through
154.486.
         (b)   All dwellings shall either be located on individual lots
fronting on a public street or within a condominium, cluster housing or multi-
family development where dwellings can be accessed by private streets or
drives.
      (4)   Conditionally permitted uses.
         (a)   Conditionally permitted uses in a PUD shall consist of:
            1.   Multi-family dwellings, including apartments, comprising no
more than 30% of the total dwellings within the PUD, when the underlying zoning
district is R-2, subject to §
154.546(B)(2), (B)(4), (B)(5) and (B)(7).
            2.   Two-family dwellings in an R-1 district subject to §
154.546(B)(2)(h)4.
            3.   Churches and other buildings for the purpose of religious
worship subject to §
154.546(B)(3), (B)(4), (B)(6), (B)(10) and (B)(12).
            4.   Group dwellings for the handicapped, subject to §
154.546(B)(31).
            5.   Home occupations subject to §
154.546(B)(17).
            6.   Off-street parking as per §§
154.405 through
154.409.
         (b)   All PUDs containing conditionally permitted uses shall be
subject to the appropriate provisions of §§
154.542 through
154.546, including a public hearing by the Planning Commission prior to the
issuance of a conditional zoning certificate and approval of the PUD general
plan.
      (5)   Project density.
         (a)   PUDs shall be "density neutral" in that the overall project
density shall not exceed the maximum allowable gross density permitted by the
underlying zoning district.
         (b)   Two-family dwellings shall not constitute more than 20% of the
total dwellings within the entire PUD or any phase thereof.
      (6)   Lot area, yard area and height requirements.
         (a)   Lot widths, setbacks and side yards and building heights for
lots with direct frontage on a public street, are permitted to be flexible in
order to allow for a variety of structural and design arrangements subject to
the following requirements:
            1.   The minimum lot area for a single-family lot shall not be less
than 6,050 sq. ft. Two- and three-family lots shall not contain less than 4,500
sq. ft. of land area for each dwelling unit.

as measured at the front building line.
            4.   The minimum front yard depth shall not be less than 25 feet;
however, for dwellings with a front yard depth of less than 40 feet, attached
garages shall be required to maintain a minimum yard depth of 40 feet or be
located along the side or rear of the dwelling to provide adequate driveway
length for off-street parking.
            5.   The minimum rear yard depth shall not be less than 25 feet.
            6.   The minimum side yard width shall not be less than seven feet;
except that two- and three-family dwellings that share a party wall shall be
exempted from these requirements.
            7.   The maximum height for one-, two- and three-family dwellings
shall not exceed 40 feet. The maximum height for multi-family structures and
other conditional uses shall not exceed 50 feet.
         (b)   Residential cluster lots shall comply with all of the
requirements listed in §
154.083(C).
         (c)   In reviewing building and lot spacing proposals in PUDs, the
Planning Commission shall be guided by factors such as unit spacing required
for adequate light and air; fire and emergency vehicle access; relationship of
building to street frontages, open spaces and pedestrian and vehicular
circulation patterns; and adequacy of the amount and location of off-street
parking required to serve the proposed dwelling types.
      (7)   General design provisions.
         (a)   Public streets shall be designed to accommodate one lane of on-
street parking.
         (b)   Private streets of less than 28 feet in width may be designated
as fire lanes where on-street parking is prohibited. Therefore, one additional
parking space shall be required, in addition to the off-street parking
requirements set forth in §§
154.405 through
154.409, for each two dwelling units or portion thereof, which are located on a
private street. On private streets with a width equal to or greater than 28
feet, the Planning Commission may allow for on-street parking in lieu of the
additional off-street parking requirements.
         (c)   All utilities shall be installed underground.
         (d)   When located outside of a public right-of-way, utilities and
their respective easements should be placed within common open spaces whenever
possible to minimize impacts on building lots.
         (e)   The PUD development plan should be fitted to the site topography
to minimize grading and soil disturbance. All projects shall demonstrate
compliance with
Chapter 155 (Soil Sediment Pollution Control) and Appendix 2 of the current
version of the Engineering Rules & Regulations.
   (C)   Common open space.
      (1)   Land area requirements. A minimum of 30% of the net area of the PUD
shall be reserved in perpetuity for common open space and recreational
facilities. Such open space shall be available to and accessible to all
residents of the PUD and shall be designed primarily for their use.
      (2)   Plan requirements.
         (a)   All PUD submissions shall include an open space use and
maintenance plan, which shall delineate:
            1.   The proposed boundaries of the common open space.
            2.   Where access to the open space will be located.
            3.   A visual and written description of how the open space will be
developed, defining:
               a.   Areas of natural resources, including wetlands, streams,
ponds, ravines, steep slopes, outcroppings, tree copses, etc., that will be
protected and left in their natural state.

      (3)   Design requirements. The design and layout of common open space
shall be governed by the following standards:
         (a)   Permanent water bodies should comprise no more than 30% of the
required open space. The Planning Commission may, at its discretion allow water
bodies to comprise up to 50% of the required open space depending on the water
body's utility as a recreational or open space asset to the PUD.
         (b)   Open space areas and recreation areas shall be distributed
throughout the PUD and located so as to be readily accessible and usable by all
residents of the PUD.
         (c)   Common open space shall not be less than 75 feet in width,
except for access corridors from streets to the open space, which may be no
less than 20 feet in width. The minimum area of contiguous common open space
shall not be less than two acres, exclusive of access corridors.
         (d)   The following areas shall not be considered as part of the
common open space:
            1.   Any private yard areas on platted building lots.
            2.   Any area within 15 feet of any condominium or multi-family
structure.
            3.   Roadways and parking facilities for condominiums and multi-
family structures.
         (e)   Access ways shall be constructed to the following minimum
requirements:
            1.   Minimum width shall be not less than six feet.

      (4)   Completion of open space improvements. All open space improvements,
including access ways, shall be installed or constructed during the phase of
development in which they are proposed, or a financial guarantee for
performance has been posted. However, all open space improvements shall be
constructed or financial guarantees for performance posted for the entire
remaining balance of the improvements before:
         (a)   Forty percent of the proposed building lots in the PUD have been
platted,
         (b)   Forty percent of all condominium and multi-family units have
been issued building, zoning and/or development permits,
         (c)   Any combination of divisions (a) and (b) above, in which 40% of
all building lots and condominium and/or multi-family units in the PUD have
been platted or issued zoning permits, or
         (d)   Within 30 months of the Planning Commission's approval of the
general plan, whichever occurs first.
      (5)   Disposition of common open space. As part of a planned unit
development, a homeowners association; community association, condominium
association, "master" association or similar legal entity shall be created for
the purpose of controlling, maintaining and repairing all common elements and
utilities in the PUD, including the common open space. Membership in the
association shall be mandatory for all purchasers of dwelling units within the
development.
         (a)   Common open space shall be prohibited from further subdivision
and development by deed restriction, conservation easement or similar
restrictive covenants. The Planning Commission may recommend that development
rights to all or parts of the common open space be deeded to the city, a park
district, land conservancy or similar organization. The accepting entity must
show the ability and willingness to accept such deed and maintain the property.
         (b)   The association shall not authorize its dissolution, nor shall
it sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of common open space or other common
facilities, utilities and other improvements without first:
            1.   Offering to dedicate the common elements to the city and
having such offer accepted by City Council, or
            2.   Establishing a successor entity for the purposes of owning,
managing and maintaining such common elements.
            The disposition of common open space and other common elements
shall be done in accordance to appropriate state laws; the controlling
documents of the association and be approved by the Planning Commission as an
amendment to the approved PUD plan.
         (c)   The association shall convey to the city, other appropriate
governmental bodies and utility providers the right of entrance to the common
open space and other common elements for emergency purposes or in the event of
nonperformance in completing, maintaining and repairing of such improvements
that affect the public health, safety and welfare. Such entities shall have the
right, after proper notice, to make improvements and perform maintenance
functions with the costs levied as liens against the property, including the
individual building lots, condominium units, multi- family buildings and
undeveloped building lots located within the development, if such liens may be
lawfully levied. In the event of an emergency, advance notice is not necessary
for entrance onto such common areas and facilities.
   (D)   Private amenities. Developers of PUD's may elect to provide certain
amenities for the benefit of the residents of the PUD, including but not
limited to swimming pools, tennis courts, playground equipment, and other
active and passive recreational improvements, subject to the limitation noted
in divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this section:
      (1)   Such amenities shall be located within the common open space and
the location and dimensions of such amenities shall be defined on the general
PUD plan.
      (2)   Such amenities shall be considered an integral part of the approved
development plan and may not be eliminated or modified without the Planning
Commission's approval.
      (3)   All amenities shall be constructed or financially guaranteed in
accordance to the provisions noted in division (C)(4) of this section for open
space improvements.
   (E)   Public improvements. Development projects, including PUDs, often
require improvements or extensions of existing public infrastructure and
streets in order to accommodate impacts from the proposed development. Such
improvements may include, but are not limited to: utility and street
extensions; roadway widening; installation of traffic control devices,
sidewalks, utility mains and ditch enclosures.
      (1)   Such public improvements shall be constructed or a financial
guarantee for performance posted according to the following table:
 
Development Type        Construction/Financial Guarantees Prior to:
Residential Subdivision Final plat approval
Condominiums            Declaration plat approval
Apartments/             Final occupancy approval
Multi-family
 
      (2)   In situations where certain public improvements have been
identified, but are not required until later phases of the development, the
required public improvements shall be financially guaranteed on a proportional
basis so that by the time the improvement is required, sufficient funds will
exist to guarantee completion of the improvements.

applicant may submit detailed civil site plans to the Engineering Department
for review and approval. No substantial changes from the approved general plan
shall be made without prior approval by the Planning Commission.
         (b)   The Planning Commission's general plan approval shall also
constitute preliminary plat approval, when the project site will be subdivided
into individual building lots or lots for open space, condominium sites, multi-
family sites or other conditionally permitted uses as approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (4)   Expiration of approval. The Planning Commission's general plan
approval shall expire 18 months from the date of original approval unless civil
engineering plans for the first phase of the development are approved and site
development commences within 12 months of engineering plan approval.
   (C)   Final use approval. Before any development or zoning permits will be
issued for any construction within a PUD, the Planning Commission shall issue a
final use approval in one of the following ways:
      (1)   Final plat approval. A PUD or any phase thereof, in which
individual building lots, open space lots or lots for condominiums, multi-
family dwellings or other conditionally permitted uses will be created, must
first obtain final plat approval as per the subdivision process described in §
153.039. All documents, financial guarantees and other certifications as
required by §
153.040, along with the appropriate review fee shall be submitted at the time
application is made.
      (2)   Condominium declaration approval. The Planning Commission's
approval of a condominium declaration and associated drawings showing the
outline of the taxable condominium units being created; limited common elements
associated with the units being created; and common open space, private streets
and other improvements to be maintained in common by the association, shall
constitute final use approval. A condominium declaration is also referred to as
a condominium declaration plat.
      (3)   Site plan conformance approval. A final site development plan for
each project containing multi-family dwellings or other conditionally permitted
uses shall be reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission as being in
conformance with the approved general plan.
   (D)   General conditions for all final use approvals. Before final plat or
site plan conformance approval will be given, the Planning Commission must find
that the following conditions have been substantially met:
      (1)   No applicable general or specific requirement of the Zoning Code in
effect at the time of general plan approval is violated.
      (2)   The final plat or final site plan complies substantially with the
general plan as originally approved or amended.
      (3)   Site plans for conditionally permitted uses demonstrate compliance
with the requirements of the conditional zoning certificate.
      (4)   The density of all dwelling units and building lots in any area
does not exceed that shown on the general plan.
      (5)   All public and private improvements and amenities, including open
space improvements, shown on the general plan as being part of the phase or
site plan seeking final use approval shall be completed or financial guarantees
for completion posted with the city. The time frame for such financial
guarantees cannot exceed a period of two years, after which the improvements
shall be installed or completed.
      (6)   The applicant has provided adequate guarantees to insure that the
use and further subdivision of common open space shall be restricted and the
title thereto transferred to an appropriate association or other legal entity
as prescribed in §
154.030(C)(5). The Planning Commission may require the applicant to obtain a
title guarantee or rider to an existing policy, prepared by a reputable title
company, showing the legal description of the land which has been set aside for
the open space along with the appropriate restrictions limiting the use of such
land for recreational and open space use in perpetuity as well as providing for
the rights of access, use and maintenance as described in §
154.030(C).
      (7)   The Planning Commission may issue final plat or site plan
conformance approval with additional conditions and safeguards as deemed
necessary to insure continued conformance with the approved general plan.
   (E)   Additions and amendments to the general plan. Any area of land
contiguous to a planned unit development may be added thereto and shall be
subject to all procedural and substantive regulations applicable to planned
unit developments. The gross density of the expanded unit development shall not
exceed the maximum density originally established.
   (F)   Minor adjustments to final plats and site plans. Minor amendments and
adjustments on final plats and site plans, such as slight adjustments to
building locations and footprints; the location of proposed amenities; or minor
revisions to approved landscaping plans, may be approved over the signature of
the Planning Director. Major changes that substantially impact the location and
dimensions of open space, building lots, streets, pedestrian ways or other
improvements must be approved by the Planning Commission as amendments to the
general plan.

('65 Code, § 1323.25)
§ 154.069 LANDSCAPING PLAN.
   (A)   Generally. A landscaping plan is required for all uses which require
site plan review. The landscaping plan must be done in coordination with
vehicular and pedestrian traffic movement and consider issues of safety and
security in design.
   (B)   Purpose. The city requires the use of landscaping in recognition of
the value of landscaping to preserve and enhance the area's image, promote the
retention and use of existing vegetation, safeguard property values, protect
public and private investments, and promote high-quality developments and
promote the compatibility between land uses by reducing the visual, noise, and
lighting impacts of specific development on users of the site and abutting
uses.
   (C)   Submittal requirements. The following items are required for a
complete landscape plan:
      (1)   Plans should be submitted at the same scale as the overall site
plan;

lights, and courts or paved areas;
      (8)   Planting and installation details as necessary to ensure
conformance with all required standards; and
      (9)   Description of street trees proposed or existing in the public
right-of-way as regulated by the Shade Tree Commission. Street trees in public
rights-of-way shall not be considered required landscaping for compliance with
this chapter.
   (D)   Landscaping and screening standards.
      (1)   Landscaped frontage strips of sites requiring site plan review and
general requirements.
         (a)   General requirements. The landscaping strip shall extent along
the street frontage of these sites and may be pierced by access ways to the
extent necessary to comply with applicable ordinances. The landscaped strips
can be of a varying width, not be less than ten feet in width. All street
frontage areas including the both frontage areas on a corner lot shall be
required to include landscape strips on the frontage.
         (b)   Minimum planting requirements. One shade tree and ten shrubs per
50 feet of linear street frontage. The width of access ways which pierce the
strip shall be included in the calculation of lineal dimensions. Commercial and
industrial zones should include landscape breaks to insure a clear line of
sight from the public right-of-way for safety and security.
         (c)   Supplemental landscape requirements; spacing of trees. Trees in
a perimeter landscape strip may be planted singly or in clusters. Clusters of
trees shall be avoided in the interior of parking lots to increase safety and
security.
         (d)   General landscape barrier. The Planning Commission may impose a
general landscape barrier. A hedge, wall, fence, berm, or other landscape
barrier shall be located within the perimeter landscape strip. Unless otherwise
provided in this section, the barrier shall be not less than three feet in
height.
         (e)   Living and nonliving barriers. If walls, fences, or other
nonliving barriers are used as elements of the landscape barrier; shrubs or
vines shall be planted as determined by the Planning Commission to be meet the
purpose of this section.
         (f)   Earth berms. Earth berms may be used only when installed in
conjunction with sufficient plant material to satisfy the provisions of this
section. The slope of a berm shall not exceed a ratio of 3:1.
         (g)   Additional landscape treatment. The remainder of the perimeter
landscape strip shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other
appropriate landscape treatment. Sand or pavement shall not be considered to be
appropriate landscape treatment unless approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Parking lot landscaping.
         (a)   Perimeter parking lot landscaping for rear and side yards. For
sites larger than 10,000 square feet, the strip must be a minimum of ten feet
wide. For sites smaller than 10,000 square feet, the strip must be a minimum of
five feet wide. One tree and three shrubs are required for 50 feet of
perimeter. Alternately, the applicant may preserve at least 25 feet of existing
woodlands. Existing woodlands must be preserved to the extent possible.
Preservation of existing woodlands in lieu of planting requirements shall be at
the discretion of the Planning Commission.
         (b)   Interior parking lot landscaping. One planting island for every
20 parking spaces. In very large lots of 50,000 square feet or more, fewer, but
larger islands may be appropriate to provide greater visual relief and create
an environment more conducive for healthy tree growth.
         (c)   Planting islands. A safe site distance at vehicular entrances
must be maintained. The trees must have a clear trunk at least six feet above
the finished grade to allow vehicular circulation and a clear line of sight
beneath the tree canopy without causing any damage. No tree planting area may
be less than five feet wide in any dimension for traffic control.
         (d)   Safety and security. Interior parking lot plantings shall not
include any shrub which would exceed 24 inches in height at maturity and no
clustering of trees shall be permitted in planting islands.
   (E)   Plant materials.
      (1)   Shrub and ground cover. All required ground cover plants and shrubs
must be of sufficient size and number to meet the required standards within
three years of planting. Mulch (as a ground cover) must be confined to areas
underneath plants and is not a substitute for ground cover plants. Trees may be
deciduous or evergreen. Deciduous trees at the time of planting must have a
minimum diameter of three inches, measured five feet above the ground, and have
a minimum height of eight feet. Evergreen trees at the time of planting must be
a minimum of six feet in height.
      (2)   Existing vegetation. Existing landscaping or natural vegetation may
be used to meet the standards, if protected and maintained during the
construction phase of the development. When the existing trees are at least 12
inches in diameter, measured five feet above the ground, they may count triple
towards meeting the tree requirements of a landscaping standard. Landscape
materials should be selected and sited to produce a hardy and drought-resistant
landscape area. Selection should include consideration of soil-type and depth,
the amount of maintenance required, spacing, exposure to sun and wind, the
slope and contours of the site, and compatibility with existing native
vegetation preserved on the site. Prohibited plants include plants identified
by the Planning Director as potentially damaging to sidewalks, roads,
underground utilities, drainage improvements, foundations, and the like. Fruit-
bearing trees are prohibited.
      (3)   Exceeding standards. Landscaping materials that exceed the
standards may be substituted for the minimums so long as all fence or
vegetation height limitations are met, including the vision clearance standards
as required by engineering or safety departments.
   (F)   Approval. Approval of the landscape plan is subject to the approval of
the site plan by the procedures set forth in city's ordinances. See §
154.070, Site Plan Review; Conformance.
   (G)   Installation and maintenance. Plant material must be installed to
current nursery industry standards. Plant materials must be properly supported
to ensure survival. Support devices such as guy wires or stakes must not
interfere with vehicular or pedestrian movement. Maintenance of landscaped
areas is the on-going responsibility of the property owner. Required
landscaping must be continuously maintained in a healthy manner. Plants that
die must be replaced in kind.
   (H)   Completion of landscaping. The required landscaping must be installed
prior to the issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. See §
154.070, Site Plan Review; Conformance and §
154.075, Certificate of Occupancy.
   (I)   Planning Commission discretion. The Planning Commission may vary these
requirements when deemed appropriate. Such variation must be requested by the
applicant prior to consideration of plan approval.

      (13)   All utilities, including cable TV, on the site shall be located
underground when recommended by the City Engineer.
      (14)   Grading and surface drainage provisions shall be designed to
minimize adverse effects on abutting properties, streams, and public streets,
during as well as after construction, to minimize the possibility of erosion.
No open drainage channels are allowed in the city. The Planning Commission may
require that such grading plans be reviewed by the City Engineer or U.S. Soil
Conservation Service with any costs borne by the developer. The costs of any
unusual means necessary to alleviate surface drainage problems on adjacent
property due to development shall be borne by the developer of the property
causing the problem.
      (15)   The design and construction of driveways and parking areas shall
conform to standards and regulations established therefore by the City
Engineer. In addition, driveway areas in industrial zones for industrial
development within the public right-of-way shall use asphalt or concrete as
approved by the City Engineer. Parking lots and driveways outside public
rights-of-way in industrial zones for industrial development may use concrete,
asphalt, ship and seal, gravel or other materials as approved by the Director
of Public Service which would reduce dust and mud.
   (B)   Conformance with site plan.
      (1)   All aspects of the development shall conform to the approved site
plan. No injurious or offensive effects shall result from the development or
operation. The control of effects such as noise, smoke, dust, fumes, odors,
electrical interference and the storage and disposal of wastes shall meet
accepted current standards.
      (2)   It shall be a violation of this chapter for any building or
premises to be occupied or used prior to:
         (a)   Conformance with all applicable requirements of this chapter;
and
         (b)   Completion of required landscaping, drainage, parking and road
and driveway improvements according to plans approved by the Planning
Commission or the posting of a cash bond or other surety in a form approved by
the City Law Director with the city in an amount equal to the required
improvements plus 10%. The bond or surety shall be for a period not to exceed
two years and shall provide for the complete construction of the improvements
within that period.
   (C)   Form of approval in large projects.  Where the Planning Commission
considers it necessary, in order to assure that a large project will be
developed consistent with the purposes of this chapter, the Planning Commission
may require that plans for a large project be submitted indicating development
in phases if such project can logically be divided into phases. The Planning
Commission shall review the entire project for conformance with all applicable
regulations in this chapter and shall give preliminary approval to the entire
project if it so conforms. However, the Planning Commission shall have the
power to limit final approval and authorization for the Zoning Inspector to
issue zoning certificates to one section or phase of the total development at a
time. Approval of subsequent phases shall be given:
      (1)   Upon substantial compliance with the plan given preliminary
approval;
      (2)   Upon conformance with all applicable regulations of this chapter;
and
      (3)   Upon a finding by the Planning Commission that all preceding phases
conform to all requirements of this chapter and conform to approved plans
including complete installation of improvements required in the approval of
preceding phases, or, in lieu of complete installation, the submission of a
financial guarantee acceptable to the city assuring that the improvements will
be installed within one year of the submission of the guarantee.
   (D)   Variances. The Planning Commission may modify the requirements of this
section where unusual or exceptional factors or conditions require, or for
large-scale developments, subdivisions of land or commercial and industrial
developments. To modify these requirements where unusual or exceptional factors
or conditions require, the Planning Commission shall:
      (1)   Find that unusual topographical or exceptional physical conditions
exist;
      (2)   Find that strict compliance with these requirements would create an
extraordinary hardship in the face of the exceptional conditions;
      (3)   Permit any such modification to depart from these requirements only
to the extent necessary to remove the extraordinary hardship.

§ 154.072 PLANNED COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROVISIONS.
   Due to unique planning problems caused by intensive commercial development
in selected areas of the city, the Planning Commission may require the
implementation of the following special requirements and standards within the
specific boundaries of these selected areas:
   (A)   Development Policy Plan required. All uses permitted or conditionally
permitted in the C-1, C-3 and C-4 districts shall be permitted only after
review and adoption by the Commission and Council of an official Development
Policy Plan as a guide for development within the boundaries of the
specifically defined area. Such plan may be prepared by the City or by other
interested parties. Such plan shall include, but not be limited to, a plan for:
      (1)   Street and/or service roads serving the specific area;
      (2)   Location of traffic signals, driveway curb cuts, and median cuts,
if applicable, serving the specific area;
      (3)   Open space within the specific area.
   (B)   Site plan review. All uses permitted or conditionally permitted in the
C-1, C-3 and C-4 districts shall be permitted only after review and approval of
the specific site plans by the Commission according to the standards, criteria
and regulations of §
154.070 and of this section. Such site plans may be prepared and reviewed
simultaneously with the preparation and adoption of a Development Policy Plan,
required for this specific area.
   (C)   Discussion meeting. In addition to the procedures for site plan review
in §
154.070, owners of property in the specific area being considered, or their
agents, should meet with the Director of Public Service or Zoning Administrator
prior to submission of a site plan to the Commission. For the purpose of the
discussion meeting, a general discussion plan shall be prepared showing the
relationship of any planned development to adjacent areas, locations of
buildings and parking areas, internal circulation and relation to the adjacent
thoroughfare system. At the discussion meeting, the Director shall inform the
applicant of the recommendations of applicable land use or thoroughfare plans
for the area, the intent of the Development Policy Plan and other information
necessary for the preparation of an acceptable site plan.
   (D)   Additional standards. In addition to the site plan review standards in
§
154.070(A), the Commission's review and action on site plans in the specified
area shall also be based on the following standards.
      (1)   Curb cuts, internal drives, parking areas and pedestrian walkways
shall be designed to promote safe and efficient movement within the site,
between adjacent sites, and between the site and the adjacent thoroughfare
system.
      (2)   A new development may be required to include construction of a
frontage road, or parallel driveway or private driveway of adequate length,
with intersections to connect it with specified predetermined entrance/exit
points.
      (3)   Where a frontage road, parallel drive or private driveway is
required, all new development shall complete enough additional length of the
frontage road, parallel driveway or private driveway, including intersections,
to connect it with a specified entrance/exit point on the major thoroughfare.
      (4)   Where a private driveway or private service road is permitted by
the Commission, such driveway or service road may be approved with the
condition that it be dedicated to the city in the future, at no cost to the
city and at such time as deemed necessary to the public interest. Such
driveways or service roads shall be constructed according to city standards for
public streets.
      (5)   To provide access to adjacent properties or to an existing or
planned parallel street or frontage drive, reciprocal easements may be required
by the Commission. This mutual easement or access right shall provide access to
adjacent properties and/or developments without the necessity of traveling on
the public thoroughfare system.
      (6)   Under special conditions where a predetermined entrance/exit is off
a development site, and a permanent private access drive is not deemed feasible
by the Commission, the Commission may permit a temporary driveway. A temporary
driveway will be permitted only if:
         (a)   The city obtains written assurances approved by the Director of
Law that the use of such temporary drive will be abandoned when access to a
planned parallel street or frontage drive or other thoroughfare is made
available; and
         (b)   In the case where the new development does not include the
construction of a planned parallel street, frontage road, access drive or other
thoroughfare on the new development property, provisions are made that such
street or drive will be constructed and, if appropriate, dedicated to the city
when such street or drive is stubbed to the new development property.
      (7)   The Planning Commission may impose whatever conditions it deems
necessary for orderly development, the preservation of the aesthetic quality of
the area, and the general welfare of the community.
('65 Code, § 1323.30)
§ 154.073 DEVELOPMENT NEAR OIL AND GAS WELL SITES AND NEAR ABOVE GROUND OIL AND
GAS STORAGE TANKS.
   No habitable structure may be constructed within 150 feet of an existing oil
or gas well drilling site, or an existing above-ground oil or gas storage tank
or battery of storage tanks. For purposes of this section, the setback shall be
measured from the geographic center of the wellhead or the geographic center of
the storage tank or battery of tanks to the closest point of the habitable
structure.

('65 Code, § 1323.34)
§ 154.077 TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS.
   (A)   (1)   A transportation analysis is generally required for:
         (a)   Any development which proposes to take direct access to any
collector or arterial road.
         (b)   Any residential development which will exceed 20 dwelling units.
         (c)   Any use which will generate in excess of either 250 trips per
acre per day or 100 trips per day.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may waive the requirements for a
transportation analysis or any specific element of a transportation analysis
should the Planning Commission determine the project will not have the scope to
warrant the analysis.
   (B)   The transportation analysis must include the minimum information:
      (1)   An estimate of the average daily number of automobile and truck
trips generated by the project when completed and fully occupied.
      (2)   An explanation of the current traffic volume and capacity of the
roadway for which the use is proposed to access as well as the impact of the
proposed development on the current traffic volume and capacity of the roadway
which the development is proposed to access. Such analysis must describe the
level of service impact on any roadway.
      (3)   An explanation of the impact of the development on all
intersections of public and private roadways within one-half mile of the
proposed development. Such analysis shall clearly describe the level of service
impact on any intersection.
      (4)   A plan which describes all existing roadway features including
traffic signs, pavement markings, road way width, traffic signals as well as
all proposed new access points and their design features and an on-site
circulation and parking plan including on-site traffic control signs and
pavement markings. Such plan also must include existing and proposed pedestrian
traffic patterns and improvements.
   (C)   All baseline assumptions and data sources must be approved by the City
Engineer.
   (D)   The transportation analysis must assess and provide average daily and
peak hour impacts and level of service impacts of new development. Such
assessment must include the cumulative impact of the new use, existing uses and
possible future uses and traffic volumes. Such information must be source
documented.
   (E)   The city hereby establishes a level of service (LOS) “C” as the
minimum acceptable level of service for all signalized and unsignalized
intersections and street segments within the traffic study area. Definition of
the various levels of service shall be as defined in the most recent addition
of the Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board.
      (1)   No development project shall cause a LOS to decrease by more than
one grade.
      (2)   For intersections and street segments currently operation at or
below LOS “C”, the existing baseline LOS must be maintained or improved after
development.
   (F)   The following general policies should be demonstrated through the
transportation analysis when appropriate:
      (1)   Commercial traffic should avoid the use of local residential
streets;
      (2)   Entrance and exit drives should be arranged to be located on
streets that are least congested or hazardous and designed to have sufficient
capacity to prevent queuing of vehicles on any street and with proper grades
alignments and site distances for safe, convenient and efficient traffic
movement;
      (3)   Provision of driveway connections to adjoining lots when such
driveways would allow cars to travel between two existing uses without going
back into a public street;
      (4)   Minimize the number of driveway connections to the street to
further facilitate traffic flow on the street; and
      (5)   Demonstrate compliance with the city Comprehensive Plan.
   (G)   The Planning Commission may, upon the advice of the City Engineer,
require on and/or off-site improvements or the payment of a portion of the cost
of improvements, necessary to accommodate the amount and type of traffic
generated by the proposed use, and to maintain the LOS standards. Typical
traffic improvements may included, but are not limited to, turning lanes,
traffic directional islands, frontage roads, and other driveway and traffic
control mechanisms designed to reduce traffic hazards. Upon advice of the City
Engineer, the Planning Commission shall also have the discretion to determine
the proportionate costs to be charged to the development project for future
traffic improvements that are required to mitigate the cumulative effects of
proposed and future development on the transportation system, even though the
proposed development may not, by itself, cause the LOS to degrade below the
established LOS standards.
   (H)   When the Planning Commission deems it necessary to cause special
studies to be made, they may call upon the appropriate technical expertise and
the applicant shall bear all direct and related costs.

ESTATE-RESIDENTIAL (E-R) DISTRICT
§ 154.085 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Estate-Residential District is to provide areas for the
development of low-density, large residential dwelling lots which front on
public streets and are serviced by public utilities. Such districts are
envisioned on the edge of the corporation limits where further annexations are
not likely or impractical and on lands that are encumbered by steep slopes,
wetlands, floodplains, abandoned coal mines or other environmental and/or
manmade conditions that make it impractical or cost prohibitive to subdivide
the property into smaller residential dwelling lots. E-R districts also provide
a buffer and transition in density from adjacent low density township
residential districts to more intensive residential zoning districts in the
city.

LOW-DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LDR) DISTRICT
§ 154.090 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Low-Density Residential District Regulations is to permit
the development of detached single-family residential dwellings on individual
building lots fronting public streets, which can be serviced by public
utilities, in areas of the community that are adjacent to or nearby areas that
have a low density of development. LDR Districts are envisioned for properties
annexed into the city and additional annexations appear likely and where
environmental conditions make further land subdivisions impractical or cost
prohibitive. Such districts act as a density buffer between the more intensely
developed area of the city and lower density residential and agriculture uses
in neighboring townships.

the community's housing demand for single-family dwellings and the sociological
and economic reasons for providing these in areas excluding two-family and
multi-family units. Therefore, the district is established and located in
sections of the community presently dominated by single-family dwellings.

   In order to carry out the provisions of this subchapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones within the airport hazard area of the
Wadsworth Municipal Airport. The various zones are described as follows:
   (A)   Runway landing areas. All runway landing areas. The runway landing
area is a rectangular area symmetrically about the runway center line with an
overall width of 200 feet and with its length extending to a line of 100 feet
beyond each end of the runway, which line is defined as the landing area end.
   (B)   Approach zones. Instrument approach zones. The approach zone for each
end of the instrument runway is the air space above a plane sloping upward and
outward from the end of the runway landing area to its outer boundary at the
uniform rate of one foot in elevation for each 30 feet measured horizontally

surface extending upward and outward at a uniform rate of one foot in elevation
for each 20 feet in horizontal distance starting at the circumference of a
circle whose radius is 6,600 feet from the airport reference point and an
elevation of 150 feet above airport elevation (this being the outer boundary of
the plane forming the base of the horizontal zone) and terminating at a radius
of 10,000 feet from the airport reference point and at an elevation of 320 feet
above the airport elevation.

restrictive limitation shall prevail.
   (B)   Public highways. No public highway shall be located less than 15 feet
below the plane of the approach zone.
   (C)   Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this
chapter, no use may be made of land under any zone established by this chapter
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for flyers to distinguish
between airport lights and other lights, result in glare in the eyes of flyers
approaching, leaving or using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of
the airport or otherwise endanger the landing, taking off, or maneuvering of
aircraft, or in any other manner constituting an airport hazard.

its proceedings and to regulate the mode and manner of conducting hearings. All
hearings shall be public.
      (2)   To hear and decide appeals, filed pursuant to R.C. § 4563.18, from
any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Airport Zoning
Commission in the enforcement of the airport zoning regulations as provided in
R.C. §§ 4563.11 and 4563.12.
      (3)   To hear and allow, refuse or allow with modifications or
conditions, any variance from the terms of the airport zoning regulations which
the Airport Zoning Commission may be authorized to pass upon pursuant to such
regulations.
      (4)   To hear and decide specific variances under R.C. § 4563.16. The
Board of Appeals shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating
such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official
actions, all of which shall immediately be filed in the office of the Board of
Appeals and shall be a public record.
   (B)   Actions. The Board of Zoning Appeals, by a majority vote of its
members, may affirm, reverse or modify an order, requirements, decision or
determination of the Planning Commission, in accordance with law.

height of any structure, or permit the increase in height of any object of
natural growth, or otherwise use his property in any manner in conflict with
airport zoning regulations adopted under R.C. §§ 4563.01 to 4563.21, inclusive,
may apply to the Board of Appeals for a variance from the zoning regulations in
question. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations would result in unnecessary hardship and the
relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest or create
conditions dangerous to the safety of the aircraft using the airport, but would
do substantial justice and would not be in conflict with factors set down for
consideration in R.C. §§ 4563.07 and 4563.08. The Board of Appeals may subject
any variance to any reasonable conditions that they deem necessary.

the regulations or limitations prescribed in this chapter and any other
regulations applicable to the same area, whether the conflict be with respect
to the height of structures or trees, the use of land or any other matter, the
more stringent limitation of the requirement shall govern and prevail.

MAIN STREET REDEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 154.350 INTENT, PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   The Main Street Redevelopment District is hereby established as an
option to the use of the underlying zoning in order to facilitate redevelopment
and new development along the Main Street corridor and adjacent streets in the
area south of the Central Business District. This area is characterized by the
following features:
      (1)   Contains a mix of commercial, industrial and residential uses.
      (2)   The area's historic industrial and commercial uses are declining.
      (3)   The area displays a "pre-1950" development pattern in which lot
areas and dimensions are typically substandard by current zoning requirements
and building setbacks are much closer to lot lines than what would be permitted
under current zoning.
      (4)   Many commercial and industrial buildings and the housing stock were
erected prior to 1950 and are in need of repair and rehabilitation.
      (5)   Limited availability of off-street parking.
      (6)   A lack of private investment, which has resulted in many vacant or
underutilized properties.
   (B)   The purposes of this district are:
      (1)   To allow for the orderly redevelopment and reuse of existing
buildings and structures in an older area of the city for which the original
uses of the structures may no longer be appropriate or desired.
      (2)   To provide guidelines for construction and design of new buildings
and structures so as to be compatible with the existing building and setbacks
typically found in the district.
      (3)   To allow for the appropriate mixing of compatible residential,
commercial and light industrial uses within a given building or on a given
property.
      (4)   To promote economic vitality and encourage reinvestment.
      (5)   To minimize or eliminate the disincentives to redevelopment created
by strict compliance with traditional zoning.
   (C)   This district shall be in the form of an overlay zoning district,
whose boundaries and inclusive properties shall be delineated and included with
the zoning district map of the City of Wadsworth, Ohio, as provided for in §
154.017 of the zoning code as noted in §
154.358 of this subchapter.
   (D)   Definitions. In addition to the definition of terms found in §
154.002 and elsewhere in the zoning ordinance, the following terms are hereby
defined for the purpose of implementing this section:
      (1)   Compatible land uses. The characteristics and impacts of different
uses or activities are either similar to the characteristics and impacts of
other uses in the general vicinity or the characteristics and potential impacts
of new uses or activities are not anticipated to have a significant detrimental
impact on the other uses in the general vicinity, especially residential uses.
      (2)   Overlay zoning district. A special zoning district which is
superimposed upon the underlying base zoning district or districts, the purpose
of which is to allow the base zoning district uses and requirements to be
altered in order to address special land use circumstances or existing
development patterns that preclude the rational redevelopment of such land
using only the requirements of the underlying base zoning district or
districts.

NONCONFORMING USES
§ 154.385 PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this chapter, or amendments thereto
which may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and
structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this chapter
was enacted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
under the terms of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue
until they are removed. It is further the intent of this chapter that
nonconformities shall not be encouraged to expand without restriction, nor be
used as ground for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district.
('65 Code, § 1352.01)
§ 154.386 INCOMPATIBILITY OF NONCONFORMING USES.
   Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts in which such uses are located. A nonconforming
use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a
structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged in any way
including attachment to a building or premises of signs intended to be seen
from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would
be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located, except as
hereafter provided in this chapter.
('65 Code, § 1352.02)
§ 154.387 AVOIDANCE OF UNDUE HARDSHIP.
   (A)   To avoid undue hardship nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any
structure, including a sign, for which a building permit was lawfully applied
for prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and
upon which actual construction has been carried on and completed within two
years of said effective date.
   (B)   To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the
restoration of a structure wholly or partly destroyed by fire, explosion,
amendment of this chapter, or prevent the continuance of the use of such
building or part thereof as such use existed at the time of such destruction or
prevent a change or expansion of such existing use as provided in this chapter.
   (C)   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on the cubic
content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing
in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any
official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such
official.
('65 Code, § 1352.03)
§ 154.388 STRUCTURES AND USES NONCONFORMING BY USE DISTRICT.
   Where, at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, lawful uses of
buildings, structures, land, and premises exist which would not be permitted
under the subdivision of uses imposed by this chapter, the uses may be
continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided:
   (A)   No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended
to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of
adoption or amendment of this subchapter.
   (B)   No such nonconforming use structure shall be enlarged or altered in a
way which increases or maintains its nonconformity except as provided in §
154.561 of this chapter, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to
decrease or eliminate its nonconformity; no additional structure not conforming
to the requirements of this chapter or amendment thereto shall be erected in
connection with a nonconforming use of land, except as provided in §
154.561 of this chapter.
   (C)   A nonconforming building, structure, or premises, if changed to a use
included in the subdivision of uses for the district in which it is located,
shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the subdivision of uses.
   (D)   When a nonconforming use of a structure or premises is voluntarily
discontinued or abandoned for more than one year, the structure, building, or
use shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the subdivision of
uses for the use district in which it is located. A nonconforming building,
structure, or premises may be change to another non-conforming use only if the
Planning Commission reviews the proposed new use and determines that the use
will be no more impacting on the adjoining parcels than the current use in
terms of: traffic volume, off-site impacts, signs and other impacts as defined
by the Planning Commission.
('65 Code, § 1352.04) (Ord. 98-072, passed 7-21-98)
§ 154.389 STRUCTURES AND USES NONCONFORMING BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Where, at the time of adoption or amendment of this code, lawful uses
of buildings, structures, land, and premises exist which are included in the
subdivision of uses for the district in which they are located but do not meet
coverage, height, yards, parking, location of the lot, or other development
requirements, such uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise
lawful, provided that:
      (1)   The lot on which such nonconforming development is located shall
not be enlarged unless the additional development upon such land shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which it is located.
      (2)   No nonconforming portion of a building or structure shall be
reconstructed or structurally altered during any ten-year period to an extent
exceeding in cost 50% of the value at which the building or structure stands on
the tax duplicate, or in any one-year period to an extent exceeding 30% of such
value, unless such reconstruction or alteration reduces the extent of the
nonconforming development.
   (B)   These cost limitations may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals
under §
154.561.
('65 Code, § 1352.05)
§ 154.390 NONCONFORMING USES IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   The following provisions apply to a nonconforming use in all districts, and
supersede any contrary provisions in this chapter.
   (A)   No extension or expansion of a nonconforming use shall be permitted.
   (B)   No reconstruction or alteration of a building or structure incidental
to a nonconforming use shall be permitted, except to reduce its nonconformity.
   (C)   No structure or building that is razed or dismantled or destroyed
voluntarily by the owner shall be permitted to be replaced.
   (D)   Section
154.389(A)(1) and (2) of this code shall in no way be construed to vary the
provisions of this subchapter.
('65 Code, § 1352.06) (Ord. 98-072, passed 7-21-98)
§ 154.391 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which one-family dwellings are permitted, a one-family
dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of
record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter. Such lot
must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in
the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to
meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable
in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than
those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which the lot is located provided it meets
Health Department standards. Variances of yard requirements shall be obtained
only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
('65 Code, § 1352.07)
§ 154.392 CERTIFICATE OF NONCONFORMING USE.
   (A)   Within one year of the effective date of this chapter, the Zoning
Inspector shall issue a certificate of nonconforming use to all known owners of
legal nonconforming use property, the use of which does not conform to the
provisions of the use zone in which the property is located.
      (1)   In accordance with the provisions of this chapter, no use of land,
buildings or structures shall be made other than that specified on the
certificate of nonconforming use unless such use shall be in conformity with
the provisions of the use zone in which the property is located.
      (2)   A copy of each certificate of nonconforming use shall be filed in
the office of the Board of Zoning Appeals and a copy given to the Zoning
Inspector.
   (B)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another of a different classification,
the foregoing provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming use existing
therein.
('65 Code, § 1352.08)
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 154.405 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIRED.
   In all districts, in connection with every building or part thereof
hereinafter created, off-street parking facilities shall be provided as

and to which such use is similar.
('65 Code, § 1353.01)
§ 154.406 ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS.

   (H)   Requirements for additional buildings or uses. For buildings or uses
not scheduled above, the Planning Commission shall apply the unit of
measurement set forth in the above schedule which is deemed to be most similar
to the proposed building or use.
   (I)   Parking for single and mixed uses. A building or group of buildings
occupied by two to four different uses or activities operating normally during
the same hours shall provide spaces for not less than the sum of the spaces
required for each use. A unit development of five or more retail stores and
services, such as shopping centers, shall provide spaces for the total area of
the building or buildings, as set forth in the schedule instead of the total
requirements based on separate uses. Whenever a group of adjoining commercial
sites have been developed and are owned separately, the Commission may find it
to be in the public interest to encourage the coordination of the circulation
system by agreements covering shared parking facilities, including coordination
and unification of ingress and egress driveways.
   (J)   Joint use. Institutions and places of amusement or assembly may make
arrangements with business establishments which normally have different hours
of operation for sharing up to, but not more than, 50% of their requirements.
The Commission shall require evidence of an agreement covering shared
facilities. Should a change in conditions cause a shortage in parking spaces,
the required spaces shall be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the
continued use of the building or use. The parking space must be within 500 feet
as measured along lines of public access.
   (K)   Parking district. Commercial uses which shall be subject to a parking
assessment or fee levied within a parking district, when established, shall be
exempt from the requirements of this section.
   (L)   Senior citizen housing. The Commission may reduce the number of
parking spaces required for senior citizen housing (well elderly or congregate
type) where the applicant demonstrates that fewer spaces shall be necessary.
When considering a reduction in the parking standard, the Commission shall
review the expected economic status of potential residents, available public
transportation, retail and personal services within walking distance and
community facilities within the building(s) to be used by nonresidents. If the
Commission permits a reduction in parking requirements, an area equal to the
difference between one space per living unit and the number of spaces actually
provided shall be reserved on the site for expansion of the parking area if
necessary in the future. The potential expansion area shall be landscaped. The
Commission may also increase the parking standard when significant numbers of
nonresidents shall use community facilities within the building(s).
   (M)   Illumination of parking areas. Parking areas shall be illuminated to
protect the public safety whenever the public street lights are lit and when
the buildings served are in operation. The lighting fixtures shall be designed
and located so as not to reflect direct rays of light in adjoining residential
districts and streets. Intensity shall not be of excessive brightness or cause
a safety hazard to users of such parking spaces or occupants of adjoining
premises. Flickering or moving of intermittent illumination shall not be
permitted.
   (N)   Landscaping. Landscape features or other visual barriers between all
parking areas and a side or rear lot line of an adjoining residential district
shall be required. In all commercial and residential districts landscaping
shall also be required within parking lots with a capacity of more than 20
cars. Such landscaping shall also be required around the perimeter of parking
areas adjacent to a public street.
   (O)   Drive-in storage area. Drive-in facilities which provide services to
customers waiting in their cars, such as fast food pick-up windows, drive-in
bank windows and car washes, shall provide storage area for 15 waiting vehicles
in order to ensure that waiting vehicles shall not extend into a public right-
of-way. The Commission may increase the required storage area for uses which
shall require additional vehicle storage space.
   (P)   Parking requirements when change in nonconforming use to a permitted
use. When a nonconforming use is changed into a permitted use or a
conditionally permitted use and there is no new building or addition to a
building made, then no additional parking need be required if the permitted use
or conditionally permitted use will not create the need for more parking space
than the pre-existing nonconforming use, if approved by the Planning
Commission.
('65 Code, § 1353.04)
§ 154.409 LOADING FACILITIES.
   (A)   Allocation of use. Space required and allocated for any off-street
loading shall not, while so allocated, be used to satisfy the space
requirements for off-street parking. An off-street loading space shall not be
used for repairing or servicing of motor vehicles and shall be available for
its designated purpose when needed.
   (B)   Location of facility. A loading space shall not be permitted in any
required front, side or rear yard. Loading spaces may be located within any
area between a building which it serves and a required yard.
   (C)   Access driveways.  Each required off-street loading space shall be
designated for direct vehicular access by means of a driveway, or driveways, to
a public street in a manner which shall least interfere with the movement of
traffic.
   (D)   Improvements. All accessory off-street loading spaces shall be
improved as required for parking areas as set forth in this subchapter.
   (E)   Schedule of facilities. Off-street loading facilities shall be

   Each additional 100,000 square feet   1 berth
   (F)   Minimum height of enclosure. The minimum height for each enclosure
shall be 14 feet. Each berth shall be at a minimum 14 feet in width and 60 feet
in depth.
   (G)   Storage of unlicensed motor vehicle. No unlicensed motor vehicle,
regardless of condition or type, shall be stored or parked in the open, or left
ungaraged, in any R-use district for more than 30 days, or for any period of
time that added together exceed 30 days. Unlicensed means the failure to
display and attach a valid license plate required by R.C. Chapter 4503, as if
such motor vehicle were operated on a public street or highway.

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES
§ 154.495 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless telecommunications facilities to minimize adverse health,
safety, public welfare and visual impacts to the community. The intent of this
subchapter is to provide incentives to construct wireless communications
facilities on existing structures and avoid new tower construction. The intent
of the subchapter is also to:
   (A)   Encourage the location of wireless telecommunications facilities in
nonresidential areas and minimize the total number of such communications
facilities throughout the community,
   (B)   Encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing wireless
telecommunications facility sites,
   (C)   Encourage the development of wireless telecommunications facilities in
areas where adverse impact on the community is minimal,
   (D)   Encourage development of wireless telecommunications facilities in
configurations that will minimize adverse visual impact, and
   (E)   Enhance the ability of providers of telecommunications services to
provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently.
(Ord. 97-036, passed 5-20-97)
§ 154.496 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ANTENNA. Any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic, radio, or
television communications through the sending and/or receiving of
electromagnetic waves.
   HEIGHT. As used when referring to a tower or other structure, the distance
measured from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other
structure, even if said point is an antenna.
   TOWER. Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily to support
one or more antennas including self-supporting lattice towers, guy towers or
monopole towers. This term includes radio and television transmission towers,
microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular, pcs (personal communications
services) and similar service towers.
   WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY. A facility consisting of the permanent
structures, including towers and also antennas mounted on towers and buildings,
equipment and site improvements involved in sending and receiving
telecommunications or radio signals from a mobile communications source and
transmitting those signals to a central switching computer which connects the
mobile unit with land based or other telephone lines. WIRELESS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY shall not include temporary mobile transmission
facilities which have less than a 24-hour operation in one location.
(Ord. 97-036, passed 5-20-97)
§ 154.497 CONDITIONAL ZONING EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   The following uses are deemed to be exempt from conditional zoning
regulations for §
154.543(A)(5) due to their ability to comply with the general intent and
purpose of this subchapter:
      (1)   Locating a tower or antenna, including placement of additional
buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said tower or
antenna, in any industrial or C-3 Commercial District; provided, however, that
such tower shall be setback from any existing residential zoning district a
distance of 500 feet;
      (2)   Installing an antenna on an existing structure other than a tower
(such as a building, sign, light pole, water tower or other structure) that is
50 feet in height or greater, so long as said additional antenna adds no more
than 20 feet to the height of said existing structure; and
      (3)   Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, so long
as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the height of said
existing tower and the total tower height after installation does not exceed a
total height of 200 feet.
   (B)   Applications which do not meet the above criteria are subject to all
regulations of §§
154.542 through
154.546 in addition to this subchapter.

§ 154.498 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing
structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or
tower on such lot. For the purpose of determining whether the installation of
an antenna or tower complies with district development regulations and these
regulations, including but not limited to setback regulations, lot coverage
requirements and other such requirements; the dimensions of the entire lot
shall control even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased
parcels within such lots. Towers or antennas that are installed in accordance
with the provisions of this subchapter shall not be deemed to constitute the
expansion of a nonconforming use or structure.
   (B)   Minimum information required for application. In addition to the
information required for all conditional zoning applications as defined in §§
154.542 through
154.546 of this chapter, the following information is required for a complete
application (applicants judged to comply with §
154.497 shall be exempt from providing items (1), (2), (6) and (7) below):
      (1)   Inventory of existing facilities. Each applicant shall provide as
part of the conditional zoning application an inventory of its existing towers
within two miles of the corporation limits of the city. The application shall
also include specific information about the location, height and design of each
tower or antenna. This information may be shared with the public with the
recognition that no representation or warranting of availability or suitability
of such sites for lease or other purposes is provided;
      (2)   Adjacent uses plot plan. Each applicant shall provide as part of
the conditional zoning certificate application a plot plan which defines
building locations, land uses and property ownership within 500 feet of a
proposed tower or antenna. If an applicant has made a reasonable effort but has
been unable to gain access to property to prepare a plot plan, the applicant
may then provide an aerial photograph which shows the information otherwise
required on the plot plan.
      (3)   Federal requirements. Each applicant shall provide as part of the
application for conditional zoning certificate evidence of compliance with
minimum Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements for radio
frequency emissions, evidence of compliance with Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) standards for height and lighting and certificates of
compliance from all required agencies;
      (4)   Building Code and safety standards. Each applicant for a
conditional zoning certificate shall provide evidence that the tower has been
designed to meet the minimum structural standards for antennas and facilities
for a minimum of three providers of telecommunications services including the
applicant. Information shall also include a description of the number and types
of antennas the tower can accommodate. The applicant must also supply evidence,
in the form of a soils report, which complies with the standards of Appendix I:
Geotechnical Investigations, ANSI/EIA 222-E, as amended, to document design
specifications of the foundation for the tower. All of the above evidence must
be provided by a licensed professional engineer and comply with nationally
accepted standards for tower and antenna design. Any pre-fabricated accessory

      (6)   Agreement for joint use of facilities. All applicants must provide
written evidence of willingness to permit joint use (co-location) of other
telecommunications service providers on the tower subject to reasonable and
accepted standards for design and construction costs and lease rates; and
      (7)   Evidence of available suitable existing structures. Applicants must
provide, as appropriate, information and evidence to justify new tower
construction as defined in §
154.500.
(Ord. 97-036, passed 5-20-97)
§ 154.499 FACTORS IN CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES.
   The Planning Commission shall consider the following factors when
considering a conditional use application in addition to the goals and intent
of this subchapter as defined in §
154.495:
   (A)   Height of the proposed tower;
   (B)   Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
   (C)   Nature and use of adjacent or nearby properties;
   (D)   Surrounding topography;
   (E)   Design of the tower to reduce visual obtrusiveness as required in §
154.502;
   (F)   Access to the tower; and
   (G)   Availability of suitable existing towers and structures as discussed
in §
154.502.
(Ord. 97-036, passed 5-20-97)
§ 154.500 AVAILABILITY OF SUITABLE EXISTING TOWERS OR OTHER STRUCTURES.
   (A)   No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Commission that no existing tower
or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate
the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of the following:
      (1)   Evidence that no existing towers or structures are located within
the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
      (2)   Evidence that the existing towers or structures are not of a
sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements;
      (3)   Evidence that existing structures &towers do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment;
      (4)   Evidence that the applicant's proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or
structures, or the antenna on the existing structures would cause interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna;
      (5)   The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower construction
are presumed to be unreasonable; and
      (6)   The applicant demonstrates other limiting factors that render
existing towers and structures unsuitable.
   (B)   The above evidence must be provided and certified by a registered
professional engineer and clearly demonstrate the evidence required. In
addition, the evidence of a request for co-location by an applicant and the
denial by the structure or tower owner must be presented to the Planning
Commission in written form.

      (1)   Fencing. A fence or other barrier a minimum height of six feet
shall surround the facility including the tower and any accessory buildings.
      (2)   Landscaping. Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum
extent practical. Minimum new landscaping shall be an evergreen screen
including trees with a maximum spacing of ten feet around the perimeter of the
tower and accessory structure area. The landscaped area shall be a minimum of
ten feet wide outside the fence area in nonresidential areas and a minimum of
20 feet wide outside the fence in residential areas.
   (C)   Vehicular access to the site shall, whenever feasible, be provided
along the circulation driveways of the existing uses. Pavement materials and
requirements shall be as required by the Planning Commission. The minimum
standard permitted for paving materials shall be chip and seal paving.
(Ord. 97-036, passed 5-20-97)
§ 154.502 DESIGN REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Tower type shall be limited to lattice self-supporting and monopole
towers. No guy towers shall be permitted in the city.
   (B)   Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to
any applicable standards of the FAA or FCC, be painted a neutral color, so as
to reduce its visual obtrusiveness.
   (C)   The design of all buildings and related structures shall use
materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the
tower facilities to the natural setting and existing structures.
   (D)   All antennas and supporting equipment located on buildings or
structures other than towers shall be of a neutral color that is identical to
or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to make
the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
   (E)   Towers shall not be artificially lighted unless required by the FAA,
FCC or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the Planning
Commission shall review the lighting alternatives and approve the design that
would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding areas. No strobe lighting
of any type is permitted on any tower in the city unless mandated by the FAA.
   (F)   No advertising is permitted at wireless communications sites or on any
structure.

RIPARIAN ZONE SETBACKS
§ 154.510 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The purpose and intent of this subchapter is to regulate construction
and land uses within riparian zones that would impair the ability of these
areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist is stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody
debris from fallen or damaged trees, stream bank erosion, and the downstream
transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by

the property line. Measurements may be made at ground level or at habitable
levels of buildings.
   (B)   If the city does not have the equipment or expertise to measure and
evaluate a specific issue or complaint, it may request assistance from another
agency or may contract with an independent expert to perform such measurements.
The city may accept measurements made by an independent expert hired by the
controller or operator of the off-site impact source. If the city contracts to
have measurements made and no violation is found, the city will bear the
expense, if any, of the measurements. If a violation is found, city expenses
will be charged to the violator. Nonpayment of the costs is a violation of the
code, and enforced through the provisions of §§
154.584, 154.585 and 154.999.

of required public improvements constructed in prior phases upon recommendation
of the City Engineer.
      (2)   For developments that require off-site improvements, a fee
estimated by the City Engineer will be charged for engineering and inspection
for such off-site improvements. The City Engineer shall also reduce deposit
fees associated with projects which include public improvements which are the
responsibility of other jurisdictions, or projects that are determined by the
City Engineer to require minimal plan reviews or inspections.
      (3)   The following schedule should be used to determine the hours for
any offsite utility improvement submitted for review and inspection:
         (a)   Engineering:    10 + 0.5 hours per 100 linear feet (l.f.)
         (b)   Inspection:    50 + 1.5 hours per 100 l.f.
      (4)   For developments that are located out of the city that require
sanitary sewer improvements, a fee estimated by the City Engineer will be
charged for engineering and inspection.
      (5)   The Director of Public Service may reduce from the schedule in §
154.540(F) due to the complexity and scope of the project. To determine this
reduction, the above schedules will be used as the baseline calculation for the
deposit.
      (6)   The Director of Public Service may reduce from the schedule in §
154.540(F) and §
154.540 (G)(2)(a) due to the complexity and scope of the project. To determine
this reduction, the schedules in (F) and
154.540 (G)(2)(a) will be used as the baseline calculation for the deposit.
      (7)   The City Engineer will then determine if any of the ten possible
baseline deductions as defined in the Engineering Rules and Regulations apply
to the project. Nine of these baseline deductions have a 5% value each and the
last baseline deduction-stormwater management will have a 40% reduction value.
A maximum 85% deduction to the baseline deposit could be obtained if the City
Engineer determines that all ten baseline deductions apply.
   (H)   Non-Payment of Engineering Review & Inspection Fees. If the applicant,
subject to any of the engineering fees imposed by §154.540(D), (E), (F) and
(G), fails to pay said fees as required, the City Auditor may pursue a civil
action to collect said fees. In addition, the use of such plans, profiles and
specifications subject to the fees and for which the fees have not been paid,
shall be deemed disapproved until all fees are paid in full and the plans,
profiles and specifications are approved by the appropriate agency.

Planning Commission.
   (C)   The zoning certificate shall become void at the expiration of six
months after the date of issuance unless construction is started or the use
changed as applied for in the application. If no construction is started or use
changed within six months of the date of the permit, a new permit is required
upon proper application.
   (D)   If the application is for a conditional zoning certificate, the
application procedure set forth in §§
154.542 through
154.546 will be followed in lieu of the above regulations.
(‘65 Code, § 1307.01) (Ord. 98-138, passed 12-1-98)
§ 154.542 CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES; PURPOSE.
   (A)   Until recent years, the regulation of all uses of land and structures
through zoning has been accomplished by assigning each use to one or more use
districts. However, the functions and characteristics of an increasing number
of new kinds of land uses, combined with conclusive experience regarding some
of the older, familiar kinds of uses, call for a more flexible and equitable
procedure for properly accommodating these activities in the community. It
should be recognized that the forces that influence decisions regarding the
nature, magnitude and location of such types of land-use activities are many
and varied, depending upon functional characteristics, competitive situations
and the availability of land. Rather than assign all uses to special individual
and limited zoning districts, it is important to provide controllable and
reasonable flexibility in requirements for certain kinds of uses that will
allow practicable latitude for the investor, but that will, at the same time,
maintain adequate provision for the security of the health, safety, convenience
and general welfare of the community's inhabitants.
   (B)   In order to accomplish such a dual objective, provision is made in
this zoning code for a more detailed consideration of each of certain specified
activities as it may relate to proposed conditions of location, design, size,
operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic and traffic movements,
concentration of populations, processes and equipment employed, amount and kind
of public facilities and services required together with many other possible
factors. Land and structure uses possessing these particularly unique
characteristics are designated as conditionally permissible uses and are
permitted through the issuance of a conditional zoning certificate, with such
conditions and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the
protection of the public welfare.
('65 Code, § 1309.01)
§ 154.543 APPLICATION PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL ZONING CERTIFICATES; FEES AND
COSTS.
   (A)   Any application for a conditional zoning certificate for any land or
structure use permitted under this chapter shall be submitted in accordance
with the following procedures:
      (1)   Consultation with Planning Commission. Prior to the submission of
an application for a conditional zoning certificate, the applicant shall
consult with the Planning Commission at any of its regular meetings.
      (2)   Application submitted to Planning Commission, fee. Any application
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission on a special form for that
purpose and supplied by the Zoning Inspector. Each application shall be
accompanied with the appropriate fee, which fee shall not be refundable. In
addition, the Planning Commission, where fee appropriate, may refer an
application to qualified consultants for a report if it deems the proposed use
may cause the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements or require
special study. The cost of such report shall be at the expense of the
applicant, and such report shall be furnished to the Planning Commission as
soon as is practicable.
      (3)   Data required with application.
         (a)   Form supplied by the Zoning Inspector and completed by
applicant.
         (b)   Site plan, plot plan or development plan of the entire property
being considered, drawn to a reasonable scale and showing the location of all
abutting streets, the location of all existing and proposed structures, the
types of buildings and their uses.
         (c)   Complete plans and specifications for all proposed development
and construction.
         (d)   A statement supported by substantiating evidence regarding the
requirements enumerated in §
154.544(B).
         (e)   A site location map showing the location of all abutting
streets, the location of all existing and proposed structures, activity areas
and parking areas and the setback of buildings and structures from property
lines.
Chapter 153, Appendix D is an example of such a location map.
      (4)   Review by Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall review
the proposed development as presented on the submitted plans and specifications
in terms of the standards established in this chapter. Such review shall be
completed and made public within 95 days of the first regular monthly meeting
of the Planning Commission following the submission of such application. The
Planning Commission may extend the review period beyond 95 days should the
applicant provide written request for such extension and the Planning
Commission considers the extension warranted. Such extensions of review of
conditional zoning certificate applications shall not exceed 60 days. If the
application is submitted at a regular monthly meeting of the Planning
Commission, then the 95-day period shall begin with the date of submittal.
      (5)   Hearing. The Zoning Inspector shall provide written public notice
to all property owners within 100 yards of the property lines of the proposed
conditional use. Such written notice shall be mailed to the addresses of such
owners within 100 yards of the property lines of the proposed conditional use
as the addresses appear on the current tax list of the county, such written
notice shall include the date, time and location of the public hearing as well
as a location map of the proposed use and sent by regular mail a minimum of ten
days prior to the proposed hearing date.
      (6)   Issuance and revocation of certificates, violation and penalty.
Only upon conclusion of hearing procedures relative to a particular application
and adequate review and study may the Planning Commission issue a conditional
zoning certificate. The conditional zoning certificate is a permissive use of
land for which a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued
within one year of its adoption. If such a permit or certificate has not been
issued within this time period, the conditional use shall be automatically
repealed without further action of the Planning Commission. The breach of any
condition, safeguard or requirement shall automatically invalidate the
certificate granted and shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Such
violation shall be punishable as per §
154.999.
      (7)   Termination of a conditional zoning certificate. A conditional
zoning certificate shall become void at the expiration of one year after date
of issuance unless all required permits for construction or a certificate of
occupancy has been issued for the conditional use proposed.
      (8)   Re-application. No application for a conditional zoning certificate
which has been denied wholly or in part by the Planning Commission shall be re-
submitted until the expiration of one year or more from the date of such
denial, except on grounds of newly discovered evidence or proof of changed
conditions which would be sufficient to justify reconsideration, as determined
by the Planning Commission. At the expiration of one year from the date of the
original application, each re-application shall be accompanied by the
appropriate fee.
      (9)   Continuation of existing uses conditionally permissible. All uses
existing at the time of passage of this chapter and conditionally permissible
in their respective districts under this chapter shall be issued conditional
zoning certificates by the Planning Commission within one year after the
passage of this chapter.
('65 Code, § 1309.02)

bounds on all preliminary plans along with a defined building footprint and
other impervious surface areas including driveways, parking areas, sidewalks so
that such open space is clearly accounted for in terms of acres of open space.
         (f)   Such uses must be properly landscaped to be harmonious with
surrounding residential uses. Where appropriate the Planning Commission may
require a buffer zone up to 50 feet between the multi-family structure and the
adjoining residential property line.
         (g)   Condominium developments shall require approval of condominium
documents including the original declaration and all amendments by the Planning
Commission for required maintenance and easement documents. Minimum setback

APPEALS
§ 154.560 BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (A)   Establishment. A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby created and shall
have all the powers and duties prescribed by law and by this chapter.
   (B)   Composition, appointment, term. The Board shall consist of seven
members appointed by the Mayor and approved by Council. Each member shall be
appointed for a period of three years, except that two of the initial members
shall be appointed for two years. The term of at least two members expire each
year. In the event of death or resignation of a member, the Mayor, with the
approval of Council, shall make the appointment for the duration of the
unexpired portion of the term of the member. The members of the Board shall be
residents of the city and shall serve without compensation. No member may also
be a member of the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Board organization. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall elect a Chairman
and Secretary from its membership, and shall adopt rules and bylaws for the
conduct of its affairs.
   (D)   Quorum and voting. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall require a quorum
of four members at all its meetings and the concurring vote of four members
shall be necessary to effect any order.
   (E)   Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held as prescribed by
the rules and bylaws adopted under division (C) of this section. Special
meetings of the Board of Zoning Appeals may be called by the chairperson or by
the written request of two other Board members. All meetings of the Board shall
be public. The Board may meet in executive session if permitted by applicable
state law.
   (F)   Witnesses. The Board of Zoning Appeals Chairman or Acting Chairman may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses in all matters coming
within the review of this chapter.
   (G)   Alternate member. The Mayor may, with the approval of Council, appoint
an alternate member of the Board of Zoning Appeals to serve for a term of three
years. The alternate member may serve in the place of any member of the Board
of Zoning Appeals who is temporarily unable to perform the duties of a member
of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.561 POWERS AND DUTIES OF BOARD.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals, as herein created, is a body of limited powers.
   (A)   Appeals. The Board shall hear and determine all appeals from any
decision or action of the Zoning Inspector in the administration or enforcement
of this chapter. The Board shall also hear and determine all appeals from the
refusal of the Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission, because of anything
contained in this chapter, to issue zoning certificates, conditional zoning
certificates or grant site plan approval.
   (B)   Variances. The Board may authorize and approve variances to the
requirements of this zoning ordinance, subject to the limitations specified in
§
154.563, in specific cases when it determines that such variances are necessary
to alleviate practical difficulties that are created by the unique physical
conditions of the property and the variances will be consistent with the
purpose and intent of these regulations. The burden of proof is upon the
applicant to demonstrate that the practical difficulties can only be relieved
by the grant of a variance. Removing limitations on the financial gain of a
property or reducing site development expenses in and of themselves do not
constitute practical difficulties.
   (C)   Conditions necessary for granting a variance. In determining whether a
variance should be granted, the Board’s decisions shall be guided by the
following factors:
      (1)   Special conditions or unusual circumstances exist, which create
practical difficulties in complying with the standard zoning requirements. The
special conditions or unusual circumstances are peculiar to the land, building
or other structures involved and are not generally applicable to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   The literal interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by similar
property owners in the same zoning district.
      (3)   The special conditions and unusual circumstances leading to the
practical difficulties were not created by actions of the applicant.
      (4)   Granting the variance will not adversely impact the delivery of
public services.
      (5)   Granting the variance will be consistent and harmonious with the
general purpose and intent of the zoning code; and will not alter the essential
character of the land; will not have a substantially adverse impact on
neighboring properties; or otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (6)   The zoning code, as applied to the applicant’s property, is
inequitable and creates a practical difficulty that cannot be reasonably
alleviated by other means and the variance is the minimum required to relieve
the practical difficulty and make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building or structure.
   (D)   Conditions and safeguards. In granting any variance the Board of
Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards reasonably
necessary for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the city.
   (E)   Violation of conditions and safeguards. Violation of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and subject to the
penalties prescribed in §
154.999.
   (F)   Board of Zoning Appeals findings. Every decision of the Board shall be
by resolution, each of which shall contain a full record of the findings of the
Board in the particular case. Each such resolution shall be filed in the office
of the Board by case number under one or another of the following headings:
interpretation; certificate; conditional certificate, or variances, together
with all documents pertaining thereto. In the event that the Board will find it
necessary to draw upon any planning, legal, engineering or any other expert
testimony, the Board may charge a reasonable fee to the applicant in order to
cover all expenses of such expert testimony.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.562 POWER OF BOARD IN REVERSING DECISION OR GRANTING VARIANCE.
   In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the Board of Zoning Appeals may,
so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this chapter, reverse
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the
Zoning Inspector or Planning Commission from whom the appeal is taken, subject
to the limitations set forth in §
154.563.
(‘65 Code, § 1311.08) (Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.563 LIMITATIONS ON BOARD'S POWER TO ACT.
   (A)   Use variances prohibited. The Board may not grant a variance to allow
a use or conditional use in a zoning district where such use or conditional use
is not expressly permitted by the zoning ordinance.
   (B)   The Board may not grant a variance to allow any of the prohibited use
classes as listed in §
154.016.
   (C)   The Board may issue a variance for the extension of a structure or use
into a more restricted zoning district, but not more than 25 feet beyond the
boundary line of the district in which such use is authorized, where a use
district boundary divides a lot in single ownership. Such variance may only be
authorized where the use proposed is permitted or conditionally permitted in
the zone for which the structure extension is proposed.
   (D)   The Board may issue a variance for the expansion of structures or
construction of new structures on premises devoted to a nonconforming use where
the cost of such expansion during any ten-year period does not exceed 50% of
the value at which the existing structures stand on the tax duplicate, or the
value of the structure as determined by appraisal or in any one-year period to
an extent exceeding 30% of such value, and together with such conditions as the
Board may deem appropriate to minimize the nonconforming character of the use.
   (E)   The Board may issue a variance for the erection or temporary placement
of buildings, or the use of structures and premises in residential districts
that do not conform to the regulations of such districts, for a period of not
more than 18 months where such structures are temporary only and uses are
clearly incidental to and necessary for residential development.
   (F)   The Board may not grant a variance to §
154.073 reducing the setback between a proposed habitable structure and an
existing oil well, gas well or an oil or gas storage tank or battery of tanks
to less than 100 feet.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.564 BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE USE OF VACANT LAND.
   In any case in which a request for a variance is granted by the Board
wherein the acquisition and use of additional adjacent land is a prerequisite
for the granting of such a variance, then such additional land must be in the
same ownership or be under a non- revocable lease for a term specified by the
Board. The variance shall be valid only so long as this condition exists. If
later conditions justify, such joined land may be separated by the Board.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.565 APPLICATION FOR APPEAL; FORM OF APPEAL OR APPLICATION.
   (A)   Application for appeal. Applications appealing any decision authorized

processing of the appeal or application. A schedule of fees is available from
the Zoning Inspector and is listed in §
154.540.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.566 PUBLIC HEARING REQUIRED.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing on each appeal and
written notice of the hearing shall be sent by the Zoning Inspector by first
class mail at least ten days before the date of the hearing to the owners of
property within and contiguous to and directly across the street from the

advertisement in a general circulation newspaper or send out additional notices
to publicize a hearing. The Board may recess the hearing from time to time and,
if the time and place of the continued hearing is publicly announced at the
time of recess, no further notice will be required. The failure of delivery of
such notice will not invalidate any action taken by the Board on such appeal.
(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.567 TIME WITHIN WHICH BOARD MUST ACT; TIME LIMIT ON BOARD ACTION.

(Ord. 16-167, passed 2-7-17)
§ 154.568 APPEALS AND VARIANCES RUN WITH LAND.

Ordinance.
('65 Code, § 1391.01) (Ord. 66-79, passed 6-5-79)
§ 155.02 PURPOSE.
   The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
   (A)   To permit development without increasing the flooding of other lands;
   (B)   To reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity
which may be caused by increases in the quantity and rate of water discharged,
and the degradation of the quality of water being discharged;
   (C)   To establish a basis for design of a storm drainage system on lands
below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights and options of both
upstream and downstream property owners and assure the long-term adequacy of
storm drainage systems;
   (D)   To promote a system of erosion control which minimizes silting of
downstream lands, streams, ponds and lakes; protects buildings and structures
from damage as may result from erosion, and minimizes the loss and/or damage to
soil and other natural resources;
   (E)   Since rapidly flowing storm water accounts for the major part of water
pollution in the form of suspended solids, diffuse phosphorous, nitrogen and
perhaps chemical and other heavy metallic pollutants, it shall be a purpose of
this chapter to help reduce these water pollution agents and establish water
quality requirements.

facilities that available storage capacity to ensure that later developments
have a similar opportunity to utilize a portion of the storage capacity.
   (D)   The applicant must provide sufficient detail to determine that
granting a variance will not result in increased flooding and that the added
volume of runoff will not materially change the recovery stream.
   (E)   The proposed development is not exempt under §
155.03.
   (F)   The development activities do not exceed the following:
      (1)   Single-family residential developments:

developer shall pay prior to final plat approval or the application for a
building permit, if a subdivision is not requested, the sum of $1.00 per cubic
foot of stormwater storage required to meet detention requirements, to the city
unless it is determined by the City Engineer that the cost of off- site
drainage facilities to serve the proposed development will exceed $1.00 per
cubic foot of stormwater storage required In such cases, the charges shall be
determined by the approving authority based on a cost estimate as approved by
the City Engineer. The charges herein above provided shall be placed in the
Special Storm Drain Capital Improvement Fund and shall be used for the
construction of off-site storm drainage improvements and appurtenances.
      (5)   Any variance granted by the approving agent shall be limited by the
condition that any addition, extension or modification of the development for
which a variance is granted shall be required to provide storm water runoff
control for the entire site if preceding limitations are exceeded by subsequent
additions, extensions or modifications.

§ 156.07 ORDERS TO VACATE.

(Ord. 10-039, passed 6-15-10)
§ 156.09 DISCONTINUANCE OF UTILITIES BY CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.
   (A)   The Code Enforcement Officer may cause any or all utilities to be
disconnected from any building or structure that has been declared as unfit for
human habitation or use and vacated, or found to be vacant and declared and

declaration and placarding of the building or structure were based have been
eliminated. The Code Enforcement Officer may cause any or all utilities serving
such building or structure to be discontinued by notifying the public utility
or utilities serving such building or structure that the building or structure
has been declared as being unfit for human occupancy or use and vacated or
declared and placarded as an unsafe building. Such notice shall include the
date the order was issued and the date the property was first vacated or
declared an unsafe building; a copy of the order relating to the building or
structure shall be attached. Upon receipt of such notice, the public utility or
utilities shall disconnect or discontinue the utility service within a
reasonable time. Any utility or utilities available to a building or structure

that the Code Enforcement Officer may initiate any proper legal action.
(Ord. 10-039, passed 6-15-10)
§ 156.11 ABATEMENT OF A NUISANCE (DEMOLITION OF STRUCTURES).
   (A)   Should the nuisance not be abated at the expiration time stated in the
initial notice issued by the Code Enforcement Officer, or within the time
specified in the decision of the Property Maintenance Appeals Board, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall notify the legislative authority that the public
nuisance has not been abated. Thereafter, the legislative authority may, after
notice to the owner and an opportunity to be heard, cause a hearing to be held
on the question of the existence of a public nuisance building, structure, or
grounds and whether and how such public nuisance building or structure, if
found to exist, should be abated and may do the following:
   (B)   Not withstanding other enforcement actions that have been undertaken
and if after all appellate remedies have been exhausted the owner fails to
abate the public nuisance as ordered, shall authorize by ordinance the nuisance
to be abated at anytime thereafter and shall authorize the Code Enforcement
Officer to proceed to abate the public nuisance.
   (1)   The Code Enforcement Officer may call upon any department of the city
for whatever assistance may be necessary or may, by private contract obtain the
abatement thereof and the cost of such private contract shall be paid for from
city funds specifically authorized by Council in order to abate such public
nuisance.
      (2)   In abating such nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer may
determine the extent necessary to complete the abatement of the same, and the
cost of the abatement action shall be recovered from the owner or owners by the
following procedures:
         (a)   The owner or owners shall be billed directly by certified mail
for the cost of the abatement. The bill for the cost of the abatement shall be
paid within 30 days after receipt of the bill; and
         (b)   If costs are not so recovered, then the city shall cause the
cost of the abatement to be levied as an assessment and recovered in accordance
with R.C. § 715.261.
(Ord. 10-039, passed 6-15-10)
§ 156.12 EMERGENCY NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   If the Code Enforcement Officer determines that an emergency exists such
that a public nuisance must be abated immediately without following the
procedures set forth in §§
156.03,
156.04 and
156.05 of this code, he or she may proceed to take steps necessary to abate the
public nuisance to the extent such steps may legally be taken under applicable
law regarding the abatement of public nuisances under emergency circumstances.
If feasible, the Code Enforcement Officer shall confer with the Director of Law
before taking such steps. If the nature of the emergency is such that §§
156.03,
156.04 and
156.05 cannot be followed but it is feasible to obtain a legislative or
judicial determination as to the need for emergency abatement of the public
nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer may seek a legislative determination
from City Council or institute any appropriate court proceeding in regard to
the matter.
(Ord. 10-039, passed 6-15-10)
§ 156.13 PROVISIONS NOT EXCLUSIVE.
   The provisions of this code involving public nuisance abatement shall not be
deemed to be a limitation or restriction on the authority of this city or any
department, division, official or employee thereof, but shall be deemed as an
enlargement of any authority existing by virtue of the statutes or Constitution
of the state, or any ordinance heretofore enacted by Council, nor shall it
limit the common law right to summarily abate public nuisances, nor shall it
limit the Fire Chief of the City of his or her powers under R.C. Chapter 3737.
(Ord. 10-039, passed 6-15-10)
§ 156.14 DISPOSITION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   No insurance company doing business in the state shall pay a claim of named
insured for fire damage to a structure located within the city where the amount
recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance policies
exceeds $5,000 and is greater than or equal to 60% of all fire insurance policy
monetary limitations unless there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (A)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on
all fire policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company or
companies in accordance with R.C. § 715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds to the Auditor of the city in the aggregate amount of $2,000 for each
$15,000 and each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if at the time a proof
of the named insured or insureds have substituted a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate.
   (B)   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies using the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the city may be disbursed in accord with the policy terms.
   (C)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Auditor of the city, after notifying the
Code Enforcement Officer shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the city has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (D)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the city as authorized by this section,
the Auditor of the city shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing
incurred by the city pursuant to R.C. § 715.261.
   (E)   When transferring the fund as required herein, an insurance company
shall provide the city with the name and address of the named insured or
insureds whereupon the city shall contact the named insured or insureds,
certify that the proceeds have been received by the city and notify then that
the following procedures will be followed:
      (1)   The fund shall be returned by the Auditor of the city to the named
insured or insureds when repairs, or removal, or securing of the building or
other structure have been completed and the required proof is received by the
Code Enforcement Officer, provided that the city has not incurred any costs for
such repairs, removal or securing. If the city has incurred any costs for
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the city shall transfer
the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds after repair, rebuilding
or removal has been completed. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
limit the ability of the city to recover any deficiency under R.C. § 715.261.
      (2)   Nothing in R.C. § 3929.86(C) and (D), as adopted herein, shall be
construed to prohibit the city and the named insured or insureds from entering
into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or
insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated.
