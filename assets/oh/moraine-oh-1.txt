ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 1392-00
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE THE 2000 CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF THE CITY OF MORAINE,
OHIO, AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the City of a
permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
 
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
 
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF MORAINE DOES HEREBY ORDAIN THAT:
 
   Section 1. The ordinances of the City of Moraine, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Moraine, Ohio, 2000.
 
   Section 2. The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in Section 5
of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted
prior to August 1, 2000, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows. The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall
not be construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislative provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
 
   Section 3. Each section of the Codified Ordinances without an ordinance or
resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section contains new
material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance. Publication of
this Ordinance shall constitute sufficient publication of all new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances.
 
   Section 4. Through authentication and approval of this Ordinance, the Mayor
and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general ordinances of
the City of Moraine codified therein are correctly set forth and constitute the
Codified Ordinances of the City of Moraine, Ohio, 2000.
 
   Section 5. This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and safety
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and
residents of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and
avoid legal entanglements including conflict with general State law, and thus
this Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062, and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be place in
their logical position.
   
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

of Council may consider among other matters:

      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)

or pursuant to Section

with the subject matter of the ordinance or resolution. The committee shall
then report on the ordinance or resolution at the next Council meeting. If a
majority of Council requests the preparation of an ordinance or resolution, but
the committee recommends in its report that the legislation not be passed, and
gives its reasons therefor, Council may accept or reject any committee report,
in whole or part. The committees to which legislation is referred shall not
concern themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They will only
determine whether the subject matter has been fully covered.

of Council or Committees and Commissions appointed by Council is not required

non- controversial matters, during meetings of Council or Committees and
Commissions appointed by Council, the presiding officer may request that action
and/or approval be taken by unanimous consent. Unless a member of the body
objects, such action/approval shall be deemed approved by unanimous consent. If

Committee of the Whole by providing their name, address and subject matter to
be discussed on a City provided sign in sheet to the Clerk of Council no later
than five minutes prior to the scheduled start of the meeting and thereafter by
raising and securing the permission of the presiding officer. Campaigning for
individual candidates for political office does not constitute a matter of
"City business".
      (1)    Such person shall state their name and addresses and the name and
address of the person or group they may represent, if applicable, in an audible
tone of voice for the record and unless further time is granted by the
presiding officer or upon motion of Council, shall limit their address to three
(3) minutes.
      (2)    All remarks should be addressed to Council as a body. No person
shall attempt to engage any Council member or officer of the City in debate
although Council members may respond to remarks. No person other than Council
members and the person having the floor shall be permitted to enter into any
discussion without the permission of the presiding officer. No question shall
be asked of a member of Council or municipal officer except through the
presiding officer. No person shall be entitled to the floor a second time upon
the same subject at one meeting.
   (b)   Disturbing a Lawful Meeting. No person, with purpose to prevent or
disrupt a lawful meeting of Council or the Committee of the Whole, shall do
either of the following:

such meeting;

sensibilities of the group.

Section
509.04 - Disturbing a Lawful Meeting. (ref. ORC 2917.12)
(Ord. 2065-20. Passed 7-23-20.)
121.04 TRAVEL EXPENSES; COUNCIL.
   (a)   The Mayor and Council Members shall receive their reasonable and
necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, as
herein set forth. No such reasonable and necessary expenses, relating to
attendance at conferences and meetings occurring outside of Montgomery County,
Ohio shall be reimbursed to Council Members or the Mayor unless such expenses
have been authorized by resolution, stating the exact purpose thereof.
Reasonable and necessary expenses shall only include expenses actually incurred
and paid by Council Members or the Mayor while in the performance of their
official duties.
   (b)   The Mayor and Council Members must file an expense report with the
Finance Director within ten (10) business days after performance of said
official duty. Said expense report shall include a detailed listing of costs
with receipts attached. Receipts shall not be required for meals and incidental
expenses when a per diem rate is paid to the Mayor or Council Member. Any
unused funds advanced by the City for expenses shall be accounted for and
repaid within said ten (10) business day period.
   (c)   Travel within Montgomery County and the performance of official duties
of Council Members and the Mayor shall be by means of one’s own private form of
transportation or by City website. Any other forms of transportation within
Montgomery County, in performance of official duties or for the attendance at
conferences and meetings must be authorized by Council.
   (d)   Personal phone calls while traveling outside Montgomery County on
official business shall be limited to one per day, except in the case of an
emergency.
(Ord. 2065-20. Passed 7-23-20.)
   (e)   Non-local Travel and Training Expenses Reimbursement.  
      (1)   Council shall pass a Resolution prior to the last Council meeting
of each year setting forth the conferences, meetings, and seminars that members
plan on attending during the following calendar year. A separate Resolution
shall be passed for any unplanned conference, meeting, or seminar, which
requires overnight travel. One-Day seminars, conferences, and meetings that do
not require overnight travel may be approved by a voice vote of Council. (Ord.
2142-23. Passed 7-13-23.)
      (2)   The City will pay in full the registration fee for seminars and
conferences which a Council member attends. The City will also pay the
registration fee for a Council Member’s spouse for conferences. All other
expenses of a spouse are the responsibility of the Council Person, except as
herein provided.
      (3)   The City will pay in full the charge for lodging when attending an
out of town conference or seminar. This will include any room taxes and the
double occupancy rate of the Council Members’ spouse accompanies them.
      (4)   Meals and incidentals. The Mayor and Council Member shall be paid a
per diem allowance, which will cover meals and gratuities. The per diem will be
based on the rate approved by the General Services Administration (GSA) for the
location of the conference or seminar (see www.gsa.gov). The Council member or
Mayor shall receive the per diem rate for each day of attendance at a
conference, meeting, conference or seminar in the performance of their official
duty as set forth in subsection (b) hereof. When meals are included in the
registration fee, the per diem will be reduced based on the following breakdown
twenty-five percent (25%), for breakfast twenty-five percent (25%), for lunch
and fifty percent (50%) for dinner.
      (5)   Transportation:
      The Mayor and Council Members are expected to use the form of
transportation that is the most economical in regards to actual cost and travel
time. Travel by airplane, bus, train, or other common carriers shall be
undertaken at the lowest rate reasonably available. Air travel must be at coach
or economy rates.
      As an alternative to commercial transportation, private/personal modes of
transportation may be used provided the Council Member or Mayor will not be
reimbursed more than what the least expensive commercial mode of transportation
would reasonably cost for the same trip. Travel time would need to be
considered in the decision to allow the alternative form of transportation. The
Council Member or Mayor would be responsible to provide satisfactory proof of
the cost of the commercial transportation to the City.
      When the Mayor or Council Member can obtain a significantly lower airfare
by staying over an extra day, the Mayor or Council Member may be reimbursed the
cost of lodging and meals for that period of time if the aggregate cost of
lodging and meals is less than the amount of the airfare saved.
      Personal vehicle - Council members and the Mayor will be reimbursed at
the per mile IRS rate current in effect, based on a detailed expense report
filed with the Finance Department.
      Airfare - Council Members and the Mayor will have their airfare paid in
full by the City. If the City purchases airline tickets for a Mayor’s or
Council Member’s spouse or companies, the amount will be reimbursed to the City
prior to the scheduled departure of the airplane.

that are not eligible for reimbursement:

   (f)   The failure to submit expense reports as herein provided shall result
in the immediate suspension of said Council Member’s or Mayor’s travel
privileges. No further expense reimbursement for official duties shall be paid,
and no further travel shall be authorized by resolution, of attendance at
conferences and meetings, including reimbursement for expenses, cost of
registration, etc., to said Council Member or Mayor who has failed to submit
said expense report and/or repaid any unused advanced funds as herein required.
Any Council Member or the Mayor, who has not timely filed their expense reports
and/or repaid any unused advanced funds shall be notified of such failure by
the Finance Director with copies of said notice being sent to all Council
Members, and, the Finance Director shall withhold from said offending Council
member’s or Mayor’s next scheduled paycheck(s) funds sufficient to reimburse
the City of Moraine for all funds advanced or not properly accounted for by
said Council member or Mayor in accordance with Section 3.6 of the Moraine City
Charter.
   (g)   Any “frequent flyer miles” or other travel incentive awards earned by

qualifications of applicants are best evaluated with a combination of a written
test and a physical ability test or assessment center, the Commission may
either:
      (a)    Make passage of the exam a prerequisite to taking the physical
ability test or assessment center to facilitate grading and notification.

qualifications for eligibility. Applicants for promotional examinations will
fill out an electronic application with the Clerk of Council at least two
business days before the date of the examination.
Section 6:    In any promotional examination, the applicant will be examined by
any combination of written, oral, physical or skills demonstration testing as
necessary to determine knowledge of the duties, responsibilities and
requirements of the position to be filled, and his or her fitness and
qualifications to discharge such duties and meet such requirements.
Section 7:    When only one person is eligible for promotion to fill a vacancy,
and where consistent with these rules, he/she may be nominated to the
Commission by the appointing authority and by a statement of facts may be
promoted to the next higher grade after passing a noncompetitive examination
similar in scope, subject, and conditions as would have been prescribed in a
competitive examination. In addition, if a current employee declines to
participate in a closed, non-competitive or closed competitive examination,
that employee is not eligible to take the open competitive examination that may
be given.

promotional examinations noted in this section, then an open competitive
examination will be administered.

calendar days of the conclusion of the examination, file protests of any
examination question only on the grounds that a question does not fairly
measure knowledge to meet such requirements. Protests will be filed on forms

appropriate in regard to a protest. The decision of the Commission as to a
protest will be final and not subject to appeal.

Scores will be rounded up to the nearest .001 percentage point.

order of merit as determined by a numerical ranking of such scores.

an open-competitive examination, priority will be given to the person whose
application was filed electronically first. Seniority will determine the
rankings on promotional examinations when identical scores exist.

appointment in the classified service will be valid for one year from the date
of certification. However, upon the recommendation of the appointing authority,
the Commission may extend the term of an eligible list for an additional year,
but not to exceed a total of two years from the date of certification. Eligible
lists may be cancelled prior to the expiration date of the list if fewer than
ten eligible candidates remain on the list.
Section 4:    A person whose name has been released from a certified eligible
list more than four times to the same appointing authority for the same or
similar positions may be removed from the eligible list, provided that release
for a temporary appointment will not be counted as one such release.

and void. The Commission may then arrange for a new examination.
Section 6:    If a candidate is deemed undesired for a position, written notice
must be given to the Clerk of Council asking that the candidate be removed
permanently from the eligible list with an explanation for the removal. This
permanent removal negates Section 4.
RULE 13: APPOINTMENTS IN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE
Section 1:    Every vacancy in the classified merit service not filled by
reinstatement or reduction will be filled by appointment from an eligible list
established for the position, or as provided elsewhere within these rules.

eligible list from the Commission for an original appointment to a position in
the classified service, he/she will specify the title, duties, and compensation
for such position.
Section 3:    The Commission will, as soon as practical, release to the
department/division head the names, addresses and scores of the ten candidates
standing highest on the eligible list. The Commission can certify less than ten
names if ten names are not available. If fewer than ten names are certified by
the Commission, appointment is not mandatory. If more than one vacancy is to be
filled, the Commission will release one additional name for each additional
vacancy.
The City Manager, after a background check, follow-up testing and on
recommendation of the department/division head, will fill the position by
selecting the best candidate out of the ten candidates on the eligible list
released by the Commission immediately after said background and follow-up
testing is complete. The "rule of ten" will be followed. This means that when a
group of ten eligible candidates are available and has been released by the
Commission for consideration, one must be appointed. Starting at the top of the
list, every candidate available, but not permanently appointed or permanently
removed must be considered four (4) times before the candidate's name can be
dropped from further consideration.
If additional candidates are requested from the current eligible list, the
Commission may consider releasing additional candidates only if one or more of
the candidates on the original certified and released eligible list is
unavailable and unable to accept the appointment or has been removed from the
eligible list.
Section 4:    If a candidate has been certified for appointment and fails to
accept an offer within five (5) business days of receipt of the notice of
conditional appointment, then such eligible candidate will be deemed to have
declined the appointment for that position, and the candidate will be moved to
the bottom of the eligible list. All offers of appointment will be conditioned
upon the candidate's successful completion of any medical examination necessary
to determine physical ability to perform the essential functions of the job, a
criminal background check, reference check, polygraph and interview. If,
however, it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission, within thirty (30)
days after giving such notice, that the candidate was unavailable and, without
fault on his/her part, were prevented from accepting an appointment, then the
name will be restored to its original position on the eligible list.
Section 5:    When the City Manager makes a temporary appointment, a
competitive examination will be held within 120 days. The temporary appointee
will be eligible to take the examination and acquires unclassified status until
the competitive examination for that position is held.
Section 6:    All applicants must possess a current motor vehicle operator's
license and must obtain a State of Ohio driver's license prior to appointment.
Section 7:    The City Manager or other designated officer will not appoint,
employ, or promote any employee in the classified service, or in any way change
the official status of any employee, except in accordance with these rules and
in compliance with the laws of the State of Ohio. No such appointment,
employment, promotion or other change in status, made in contravention of any
provision of these rules, will be valid.
RULE 14: PROBATIONARY PERIOD
Section 1:    All original appointments will be for a probationary period of
twelve months. No appointment is final until the appointee has satisfactorily
served his/her probationary period. Such satisfactory performance will be
evidenced by probationary evaluations to be completed by the appropriate
department head at the completion of six and eleven months of service. The
department or division head can extend the probationary period at their
discretion for just reason.
All promotional appointments will be subject to a probationary period as
established in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 2:    If work performance is deemed unsatisfactory, the appointee may
be removed (in the case of an original appointment) or reduced (in the case of
a promotion) at any time by the appointing authority during the probationary
period. Such appointees will be notified in writing of the reasons for the
unsatisfactory performance. The employee may not appeal a probationary removal
to the Commission.
Section 3:    No probationary period is required following a demotion.
Section 4:    If an employee is not in active pay status for any period of time
during the probationary period, then the time of such leave or inactive status
is not counted as part of the probationary period. For the purpose of extending
the probationary period, any leave of less than one day will not be considered.
RULE 15: TEMPORARY APPOINTMENT
Section 1:    Temporary appointments may be made by the City Manager for a
limited period of time, not to exceed six (6) months, and must be approved by
the Commission when there are valid reasons to do so for the efficient
operation of the City as set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section 124.30. The
City Manager may select any individual on the eligible list for permanent
appointment to serve in a temporary position.
Section 2:    Such temporary appointment will not count as time served towards
the completion of a probationary period, nor confer any vested rights in a
full-time position of the same title, grade or classification.

following successful completion of the
probationary period.
Section 10:    Consideration of past experience, evaluations, training and

(salary, sick leave accrual and vacation accrual) for a lateral entry
applicant. Maximum starting compensation will not be greater than the
equivalent step of a four-year Moraine employee.
Section 11:    The City of Moraine does not accept the transfer of unused
vacation or paid time off credit from a previous employer and does not transfer
unused vacation time or paid time off, other than unused sick leave, to another
entity. Unused vacation time will be paid out at the employee's current hourly
rate.
Section 12:    An employee who has had prior service with another Ohio public
agency may receive credit for all unused sick leave earned while in such

preceding employer will be eligible for transfer to the City. The employee,
within one (1) year of hire by the City, must furnish a properly certified
letter from the previous employer stating the amount of sick leave so
accumulated if the employee wishes to have that accrued sick leave balance
credited to their Moraine sick leave balance. Accumulated sick leave so
certified shall be credited to the employee's record as of the date received by
the City. (ORC124.38)

151.01 POLICY STATEMENT.
   It is the policy of The City of Moraine, Ohio to deposit and invest public
funds in a manner which will provide a market return with the preservation and
maximum security of invested funds while meeting the daily cash flow needs of
the City. The Investment Policy is based upon recommended nationally approved
policy formats and is intended to comply with all recognized legal and
statutory regulations, adhering at all times to Charter of the City of Moraine,
provided however that while the Ohio Uniform Investment Policy (Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135) shall be used as a guideline, Moraine's Charter Municipality
status allows it to vary from strict compliance therewith where deemed
appropriate for City investments. The Finance Director is the investment
officer primarily charged with the responsibility for the purchase and sale of
investments and the execution of this investment policy, subject however, to
periodic consultation with and review by City Council and its Treasury
Investment Committee.

151.02 SCOPE.
   This investment policy of the City of Moraine applies to all financial
assets of The City of Moraine including active deposits, inactive deposits and
interim deposits as those terms are defined by Ohio R.C. 135.01. The Finance
Director shall routinely monitor the contents of the investment portfolio, the
available markets and the relative value of competing investments and will
adjust the portfolio accordingly.
   Except for cash in certain restricted and special funds, the City of Moraine
will consolidate cash balances from all funds to maximize investments.
Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based on their
respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
(Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.03 TREASURY INVESTMENT COMMITTEE.
   A Treasury Investment Committee as established under Moraine Codified
Ordinances Chapter
152 shall review investments and advise the investing authority of the City in
order to ensure the best and safest return of funds available to the City for
deposit or investment.
(Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.04 INVESTMENT AUTHORITY.
   Management responsibility for the investment program rests with the Finance
Director as set forth in Article VI, Section
6.4 of the Charter of the City of Moraine.
(Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.05 OBJECTIVES OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES.
   The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be
safety, liquidity and yield.
151.051 SAFETY.
   Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program.
Investments shall be undertaken in such a manner that seeks to ensure the
preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to
mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk.
151.052 CREDIT RISK.
   The City of Moraine will minimize credit risk, which is the risk that the
market value of securities in the portfolio will fall due to changes in market
interest rates, by:
•   Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in Section
151.09 of this investment policy.
•   Pre-qualifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries,
and advisors with which the City of Moraine will do business in accordance with
Section
151.07.
•   Diversifying the investment portfolio so that the impact of potential
losses from any one individual issuer will be minimized.
151.053 INTEREST RATE RISK.
   The City of Moraine will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that
the market value of the portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest
rates, by:
•   Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash
requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell
securities on the open market prior to maturity.
•   Investing active deposits necessary for operating funds primarily in
shorter-term demand accounts and money market deposit accounts or similar
investments in accordance with this policy ( See, Section
151.092)
151.054 LIQUIDITY.
   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all
operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished
by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash
needs to meet anticipated demands (static liquidity). Furthermore, since all
possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the portfolio should consist
largely of securities with active secondary or resale markets (dynamic
liquidity). Alternatively, a portion of the portfolio may be placed in money
market mutual funds or local government investment pools which offer same day
liquidity for short-term funds.
151.055 YIELD.
   The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a
market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into
account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on
investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity
objectives described above. The core of investments is limited to relatively
low risk being assumed. Securities shall generally be held until maturity with
the following exceptions:
•   A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of
principal.
•   A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the
portfolio.
•   Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
151.056 LOCAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   Where appropriate, funds may be invested for the betterment of the local
economy or that of local entities within the State. The City of Moraine may
accept a proposal from an eligible institution which provides for reduced rate
of interest provided that such institution documents the use of deposited funds
for community development projects.
   (Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.06 STANDARDS OF CARE.
151.061 PRUDENCE.
   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the
"prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an
overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and this investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or
market risk changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a
timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in
accordance with the terms of this policy.
   The "prudent person" standard states that " Investments shall be made with
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable
income to be derived."
151.062 ETHICS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and
management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to
make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any
material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business.
They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that
could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and
officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with
the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the City of
Moraine.
151.063 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the Finance
Director, hereinafter referred to as investment officer and derived from
Article VI, Section
6.4 of the Charter of the City of Moraine. Responsibility for the operation of
the investment program is hereby delegated to the investment officer, who shall
act in accordance with established written procedures and internal controls for
the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy.
Procedures should include references to: safekeeping, delivery vs. payment,
investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, and
collateral/depository agreements. No person can engage in an investment
transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the
procedures established by the investment officer. The investment officer shall
be responsible for all transaction undertaken and shall establish a system of
controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.
(Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.07  AUTHORIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEPOSITORIES, AND BROKER/DEALERS.
   A list will be maintained of financial institutions and depositories
authorized to receive deposits and/or to provide investment services. Financial
institutions eligible for deposits of active deposits shall satisfy the
criteria set forth at Ohio Revised Code Section 135.03.
   In addition, a list will be maintained of approved security broker\dealers
selected by creditworthiness (e.g., a minimum capital requirement of
$10,000,000 and five years of operation). These may include "primary" dealers
or regional dealers that qualify under Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)
Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
   All financial institutions and broker\dealers who desire to become qualified
for investment transactions must supply the following as appropriate:
•   Audited financial statements demonstrating compliance with state and
federal capital adequacy guidelines.
•   Proof of National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) certification
(not applicable to Certificate of Deposit counterparties).
•   Proof of State registration.
•   Certification of having read, understood and agreed to comply with the City
of Moraine's investment policy.
•   Evidence of adequate insurance coverage (i.e. Federal Depository Insurance
Corp.).
   An annual review of the financial condition and registration of all
qualified financial institutions and broker\dealers will be conducted by the
investment officer.
151.071 MINORITY AND COMMUNITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.
   From time to time, the investment officer may choose to invest in
instruments offered by minority and community financial institutions. In such
situations, a waiver to certain parts of the criteria under Section
151.07 may be granted. All terms and relationships will be fully disclosed
prior to purchase and will be reported to the appropriate entity on a
consistent basis and consistent with state and local law. These types of
investment purchases must be approved in advance by the Treasury Investment
Committee upon recommendation of the investment officer.
   (Ord. 1776-10. Passed 9-23-10.)
151.08 SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY.
151.081 DELIVERY AND PAYMENT.
   All trades of marketable securities will be executed by delivery vs. payment
(DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial
institution prior to the release of funds.
151.082 SAFEKEEPING.
   Securities will be held by an independent third party custodian selected by
the entity as evidenced by safekeeping receipts in the City of Moraine's name.
The safekeeping institution shall annually provide a copy of their most recent
report on internal controls.
151.083 INTERNAL CONTROLS.
   The investment officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an
internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City of
Moraine are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. Details of the internal
controls system shall documented in an investment procedures manual and shall
be reviewed updated annually. The internal control structure shall be designed
to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of
reasonable assurance recognizes that (1) the cost of a control should not
exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and
benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.
   The internal control structure shall address the following points:
   •   Control of collusion
   •   Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping
   •   Custodial safekeeping
   •   Avoidance of physical delivery securities
   •   Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members
   •   Written confirmation of transaction for investments and wire transfers
   •   Dual authorizations of wire transfers
   •   Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and third
party custodian
   Accordingly, the investment officer shall establish a person for an annual
independent review by external auditor to assure compliance with policies and
procedures or alternatively, compliance should be assured through the City of
Moraine's annual independent audit.

guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States.
Nothing in the classification of eligible obligations set forth in division (B)

in divisions (B)(2) to (7) of this section shall be construed to authorize any
investment in stripped principal or interest obligations of such eligible
obligations.
   (2)    Bonds, notes, debentures, or any other obligations or securities
issued or guaranteed by any federal government agency or instrumentality,
including but not limited to, the federal national mortgage association,
federal home loan bank, federal farm credit bank, federal home loan mortgage
corporation and government national mortgage association. All federal agency
securities shall be direct issuances of federal government agencies or

obligation itself. Any security, obligation, trust account, or other instrument
that is created from an issue of the United States Treasury or is created from
an obligation of a federal agency or instrumentality or is created from both is
considered a derivative instrument. An eligible investment described in this
section with a variable interest rate payment, based upon a single interest
payment or single index comprised of other eligible investments provided for in
division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, is not a derivative, provided that such
variable rate investment has a maximum maturity of two years.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, bonds, notes, debentures, or any
other obligations or securities issued or guaranteed by any federal government
agency or instrumentality as described in division B(2) shall not be considered
"derivatives".
   (D)   Except as provided in division (E) of this section, any investment
made pursuant to this section must mature within five years from the date of

eligible institution or any eligible dealer pursuant to division (M) of this
section, under the terms of which agreement the City purchases, and such
institution or dealer agrees unconditionally to repurchase any of the
securities listed in divisions (B)(1) to (6), except letters of credit
described in division (B)(2), of Section 135.18 of the Revised Code. The market
value of securities subject to an overnight written repurchase agreement must
exceed the principal value of the overnight repurchase agreement by at least
two per cent. A written repurchase agreement shall not exceed thirty days and
the market value of securities subject to a written repurchase agreement must
exceed the principal value of the written repurchase agreement by at least two
per cent and be marked to market daily. All securities purchased pursuant to
this division shall be delivered into the custody of the Finance Director or an
agent designated by the Finance Director or Treasury Investment Committee. A
written repurchase agreement with an eligible securities dealer shall be
transacted on a delivery versus payment basis. The agreement shall contain the
requirement that for each transaction pursuant to the agreement the
participating institution or dealer shall provide all of the following
information:
         (1)    The par value of the securities;
         (2)    The type, rate, and maturity date of the securities;
         (3)    A numerical identifier generally accepted in the securities

City, at the time of making the investment, reasonably expects that the
investment can be held until its maturity.
   (G)    The City shall not pay interim moneys into a fund established by
another subdivision, treasurer, governing board, or investing authority, if
that fund was established for the purpose of investing the public moneys of
other subdivisions. This division does not apply to the payment of public
moneys into either of the following:
         (1)    The Ohio subdivision's fund pursuant to division (B)(5) of this
section;
         (2)    A fund created solely for the purpose of acquiring,
constructing, owning, leasing, or operating municipal utilities pursuant to the
authority provided under Section 715.02 of the Revised Code or Section 4 of
Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.
    For purposes of division (G) of this section, "subdivision" includes a
county.
   (H)    The use of leverage, in which the City uses its current investment
assets as collateral for the purpose of purchasing other assets, is prohibited.
The issuance of taxable notes for the purpose of arbitrage is prohibited.
Contracting to sell securities that have not yet been acquired by the City, for
the purpose of purchasing such securities on the speculation that bond prices
will decline, is prohibited.
   (I)    Whenever, during a period of designation, the Finance Director
classifies public moneys as interim or inactive moneys, the Finance Director
shall notify the Treasury Investment Committee of such action. The notification
shall be given within thirty days after such classification and in the event
the Treasury Investment Committee does not concur in such classification or in
the investments or deposits made under this section, the Treasury Investment
Committee may order the Finance Director to sell or liquidate any of such
investments or deposits, and any such order shall specifically describe the
investments or deposits and fix the date upon which they are to be sold or
liquidated. Investments or deposits so ordered to be sold or liquidated shall
be sold or liquidated for cash by the Finance Director on the date fixed in
such order at the then current market price. Neither the Finance Director nor
the members of the Treasury Investment Committee shall be held accountable for
any loss occasioned by sales or liquidations of investments or deposits at
prices lower than their cost. Any loss or expense incurred in making such sales
or liquidations is payable as other expenses of the Department of Finance.
   (J)    If any investments or deposits purchased under the authority of this
section are issuable to a designated payee or to the order of a designated
payee, the name of the City of Moraine shall be so designated. If any such
securities are registrable either as to principal or interest, or both, then
such securities shall be registered in the name of the City of Moraine as such.
   (K)    The Finance Director is responsible for the safekeeping of all
documents evidencing a deposit or investment acquired by the City under this
section. Any securities may be deposited for safekeeping with a qualified
trustee as provided in Section 135.18 of the Revised Code, except the delivery
of securities acquired under any repurchase agreement under this section shall
be made to a qualified trustee, provided, however, that the qualified trustee
shall be required to report to the Finance Director. Treasury Investment
Committee, auditor of state, or an authorized outside auditor at any time upon
request as to the identity, market value, and location of the document
evidencing each security, and that if the participating institution is a
designated depository of the City of Moraine for the current period of
designation, the securities that are the subject of the repurchase agreement
may be delivered to the City or held in trust by the participating institution
on behalf of the City. Interest earned on any investments or deposits
authorized by this section shall be collected by the Finance Director and
credited to the proper fund of the subdivision.
   (L)    Whenever investments or deposits acquired under this section mature
and become due and payable, the Finance Director shall present them for payment
according to their tenor, and shall collect the moneys payable thereon. The
moneys so collected shall be treated as public moneys.
   (M)   (1)    All investments, except for investments in securities described
in divisions (B)(4) and (5) of this section and for investments by the City in
the issues of the City of Moraine, shall be made only through a member of the
national association of securities dealers, through a bank, savings bank, or
savings and loan association regulated by the superintendent of financial
institutions, or through an institution regulated by the comptroller of the

federal reserve system.
      (2)    Payment for investments shall be made only upon the delivery of
securities representing such investments to the Finance Director. If the
securities transferred are not represented by a certificate, payment shall be
made only upon receipt of confirmation of transfer from the custodian by
Finance Director, or qualified trustee.
   (N)    In making investments authorized by this section, the Finance
Director may retain the services of an investment advisor, provided the advisor
is licensed by the division of securities under Section 1707.141 of the Revised
Code or is registered with the securities and exchange commission, and
possesses experience in public funds investment management, specifically in the
area of state and local government investment portfolios, or the advisor is an
eligible institution mentioned in Section 135.03 of the Revised Code.
   (O)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, the Finance Director shall not make an investment or deposit
under this section, unless there is on file with the auditor of state a written
investment policy approved by the Treasury Investment Committee and City
Council. The policy shall require that all entities conducting investment
business with the City of Moraine shall acknowledge receipt and understanding
of the City's investment policy. All brokers, dealers, and financial
institutions, described in division (M)(1) of this section, initiating
transactions with the Finance Director by giving advice or making investment
recommendations shall sign the investment policy thereby acknowledging their
agreement to abide by the policy's contents. All brokers, dealers, and
financial institutions, described in division (M)(1) of this section, executing
transactions initiated by the Finance Director, having read the policy's
contents, shall sign the investment policy thereby acknowledging their
comprehension and receipt.
   
   (P)    The City may enter into a written investment or deposit agreement
that includes a provision under which the parties agree to submit to nonbinding
arbitration to settle any controversy that may arise out of the agreement,
including any controversy pertaining to losses of public moneys resulting from
investment or deposit. The arbitration provision shall be set forth entirely in
the agreement, and the agreement shall include a conspicuous notice to the
parties that any party to the arbitration may apply to the court of common
pleas of the county in which the arbitration was held for an order to vacate,
modify, or correct the award. Any such party may also apply to the court for an
order to change venue to a court of common pleas located more than one hundred
miles from the county in which the City of Moraine is located.
For purposes of this division, "investment or deposit agreement" means any
agreement between the City and a person, under which agreement the person
agrees to invest, deposit, or otherwise manage a subdivision's interim moneys
on behalf of the City, or agrees to provide investment advice to the Finance
Director.
   (Q)    An investment made by the City prior to enactment of this revised
Investment Policy may be held until maturity, or if the investment does not
have a maturity date, it may be held until five years from the effective date
hereof, regardless of whether the investment would qualify as a legal
investment under the terms of this section as amended.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules"
which prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic
cases. Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under
which the Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in
Ward v. Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel.
Brockman v. Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a
defendant is entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision
(C). If a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the
defendant waives his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case
if (1) his compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.
171.01   Installment payment of fines.
171.02   Acts in contempt of court.

171.01 INSTALLMENT PAYMENT OF FINES.
   (a)    Court May Require Installment Payments. Upon a plea and proof that a
person is unable to pay any fine imposed by any City ordinance or State
statute, the Court may order its payment in equal monthly installments of five
dollars ($5.00) or such other greater sum or at such other more frequent
intervals as may be agreeable to the person until the fine is satisfied in
full.
   (b)    Balance Due Upon Any Default. Upon default by the defendant of any
such installments, the entire balance of the fine shall immediately be due and
payable by the defendant.
   (c)    Hearing and Notice of Default. The Court, upon receipt of a report of
such default, shall set a date and place of hearing with proper notice to the
defendant ordering the defendant to appear and show cause why he should not be
imprisoned until the fine is satisfied in full. Such notice shall be made
either by personal service or by certified mail to the defendant at the last
known address, at least five days prior to the date set for the hearing.
   (d)    Maximum Imprisonment Authorized. After hearing thereon, if the
evidence warrants, the Court shall sentence the defendant to imprisonment in
the City jail or other place of legal incarceration for a term not to exceed
six months for any one offense until the fine is fully paid.
   (e)    Credit for Work Performed. Such defendant shall be allowed a credit
as provided under Ohio R.C. 2947.14 for each day's work within such place of
incarceration on account of such fine. (Ord. 420. Passed 9-4-75.)
171.02 ACTS IN CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)   A person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished as for a
contempt:
      (1)   Disobedience of, or resistance to, a failure to comply with a
lawful writ, process, order, rule, judgment or command from the Mayor or other
official acting on behalf of the Mayor in the Moraine Mayor’s Court.
      (2)   Misbehavior of an officer of the Court in performance of his
official duties or in his official transactions;
      (3)   Failure to obey a subpoena duly served or refusal to be sworn or to
answer as a witness when lawfully required;
   (b)   Hearing on Contempt: Penalties.
      (1)   In contempt proceedings the Court shall conduct a hearing. At the
hearing, the Mayor shall investigate the charge and hear any answer or
testimony that the accused makes or offers and shall determine whether the
accused is guilty of the contempt charge.
   (c)   If the accused is found guilty the court may impose any of the
following penalties.
      (1)   For a first offense, not more than $250.00 or a definite term of
imprisonment of not more than 30 days in jail, or both.
      (2)   For a second or subsequent offense a fine of not more than
$1,000.00 or a definite term of imprisonment of not more than 180 days in jail,
or both;
      (3)   When the contempt consists of the omission to do an act which the
accused yet can perform, the accused may be imprisoned until the act is
performed.

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,

to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (g)    Exception. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon any

181.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    (1)    Each person who is engaged in business, or whose salary,
wages, commissions or other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file, on or before
April 15 in each year, a return with the Director. A taxpayer on a fiscal year
accounting basis for Federal income tax purposes shall, beginning with his
first fiscal year, any part of which falls within the effective period of this
chapter, file his return within four months from the end of such fiscal year or
period. The Director is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the
return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by such
employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Director shall be
accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject to
tax under this chapter, is such salary, wages, commissions or other
compensation.
         (Ord. 1405-01. Passed 2-22-01; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
      (2)    The return shall be accompanied by payment of any taxes due
thereon.
   (b)    The return shall be filed with the Director on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Director setting forth:
      (1)    The aggregate amounts of salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned, and gross income from any business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income, earned during the preceding year and subject to such tax;
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other
information as the Director may require, including a statement that the figures
used in the return are the figures used in the return for Federal income tax,
adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of
this chapter.
   (c)   (1)   The Director may extend the time for filing of the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer for a period of not to exceed six months, or
one month beyond any extension requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue
Service for the filing of the Federal income tax return. The Director may
require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown
to be due thereon by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or
interest shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the
final tax paid within the period as extended.
         (Ord. 1405-01. Passed 2-22-01.)
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City income tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a federal filing extension with the Director. The request for
extension shall be filed not later than the last day for filing the City income
tax return as prescribed in the chapter. The City shall grant such a request
for extension filed before January 1, 2004 for a period not less than the
period of the federal extension request. For taxable years beginning after
2003, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended. The city may deny a taxpayer’s request for
extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file
a copy of the request for federal extension, owes the Municipality any
delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest, assessment, or other charge for
the late payment or nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any
required income tax return, report, or other related document for a prior tax
period. The granting of an extension for filing a City income tax return does
not extend the last date for paying the tax without penalty unless the City
grants an extension of that date.
         (Ord. 1405-01. Passed 2-22-01; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
   
   (d)    (1)    The taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Director the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06; or where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07; or where an income tax, creditable against the Moraine tax pursuant to
Section
181.15, has been paid to another Municipality, credit for the amount so paid
shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any,
shall be due and payable at the time of filing of such return.
      (2)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the City is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or, at his election indicated on
the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that
no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be
collected or refunded. (Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78.)
   (e)    As used in this section, "Ohio business gateway" means the online
computer network system, initially created by the Department of Administrative
Services under Section 125.30 of the Ohio Revised Code, that allows private
businesses to electronically file business reply forms with state agencies and
includes any successor electronic filing and payment system.
      (1)   Notwithstanding Section 718.05 of the Ohio Revised Code, on and
after January 1, 2005, any taxpayer that is subject to any municipal
corporation's tax on the net profit from a business or profession and has
received an extension to file the federal income tax return shall not be
required to notify the municipal corporation of the federal extension and shall
not be required to file any municipal income tax return until the last day of
the month to which the due date for filing the federal return has been
extended, provided that, on or before the date for filing the municipal income
tax return, the person notifies the Tax Commissioner of the federal extension
through the Ohio business gateway. An extension of time to file is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due.
      (2)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a taxpayer
subject to any municipal corporation's tax on the net profit from a business or
profession may file any municipal income tax return or estimated municipal
income return, and may make payment of amounts shown to be due on such returns,
by using the Ohio business gateway.
      (3)   A.   As used in this division, "qualifying wages" has the same
meaning as in Section 718.03 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         B.   Any employer may report the amount of municipal income tax
withheld from qualifying wages paid on or after January 1, 2007, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio business gateway.
      (4)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall be required to pay any fee or charge
for the operation or maintenance of the Ohio business gateway.
      (6)   The use of the Ohio business gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons pursuant to this section does not affect the legal
rights of municipalities or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. This State
shall not be a party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an
appeal of a municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically
provided by law.
      (7)   A.   The Tax Commissioner shall adopt rules establishing:
            1.   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file
returns and make payments through the Ohio business gateway; and
            2.   The information taxpayers must submit when filing municipal
income tax returns through the Ohio business gateway.
         B.   The Commissioner shall consult with the Ohio business gateway
steering committee before adopting the rules described in subsection (e)(7)A.
      (8)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the ability of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
         (Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
   (f)    Amended Returns. 
      (1)    Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
181.11 and
181.15. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Director.
      (2)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Moraine tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Moraine return showing income subject to the
City tax based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay
any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
         (Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)     Each employer within, or doing business within the City who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis
shall deduct at the time of payment of such salaries, wages, commissions or
other compensation, the tax imposed under this chapter of the gross salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each month, make a
return and pay to the Director the amount of taxes so deducted during the
preceding month. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Director and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor by the Director. Provided, however, that the Director shall
have the authority to approve the filing of returns and payments of tax, on
other than a monthly basis as follows:
(Ord. 778-86. Passed 1-8-87; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
      (1)    The Director may authorize any employer to file returns and remit
taxes withheld on a quarterly basis provided the Director determines that such
authorization shall not jeopardize the best financial interests of the City.
      (2)    Any employer desiring to file returns and remit taxes on a
quarterly basis shall submit a written request to the Director. Such request
shall be in writing and shall contain the name and address of the employer; the
estimated amount of tax to be withheld each quarter and the name and title of
the person responsible for complying with the withholding requirements of this
chapter.
      (3)    In determining whether to grant such a request, the Director shall
base his decision solely upon whether the best financial interests of the City
shall be served. The Director shall notify the employer, in writing, of his
decision.
      (4)    The Director may withdraw any authorization for quarterly filing
and payments at any time when, in his sole judgment, he determines it to be in
the best financial interest of the City to do so.
   (b)    Each employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer. Each employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact,
has been withheld.
   (c)    It shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, of the
president and treasurer of each corporation, required to withhold the tax from
wages of its employees, under this section, to see that all such taxes so
withheld are paid to the City in accordance with the provisions of this
section. If taxes withheld by a corporation from the salaries of its employees
are not paid to the City in accordance with the provisions of this section, the
president and treasurer of such corporation shall each be criminally liable
under the provisions of Section
181.12.
(Ord. 778-86. Passed 1-8-87.)
   (d)    Every person who owns any interest in one or more rental units shall
furnish to the Director a list of the names of all the persons leasing,
renting, or otherwise occupying such rental unit or units. Such list shall be
filed semi-annually on or before the last day of January and on or before the
last day of July of each year on a form provided by the Director, unless the
Director grants an extension. If such persons fail to provide the above
information to the Director, they shall be liable under the provisions of
Section
181.12.
   (e)    Every business that hires a leasing company to obtain temporary
employees shall furnish to the Director a list of the names of all the persons
being leased or hired temporarily, as well as the Leasing company’s name,
contact person, address and phone number. The above information shall be filed
semi-annually on or before the last day of January and on or before the last
day of July of each year on a form provided by the Director, unless the
Director grants an extension. If such persons fail to provide the above
information to the Director, they shall be liable under the provisions of
Section
181.12.
   (f)    On or before January 30 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return, on a form or forms prescribed by and obtainable from the
Director, setting forth the names and addresses of all employees from whose
compensation the tax was withheld during the preceding calendar year, and the
amount of tax withheld from the listed employees and such other information as
may be required by the rules and regulations adopted by the Director.
   (g)    Any business that will be filing withholding annual reconciliations
with 250 or more W-2’s shall file such information with the Director via email,
diskette, or CD. The Director will provide in writing format requirements for
all such electronic filings. Any business that will be filing annual
reconciliations with less than 250 W-2’s may file in the above electronic
means.
   (h)    However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages
or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person's residence. (Ord. 778-86. Passed 1-8-87; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-
14-04.)
181.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated
profit or loss from such business activity together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any.
(Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78.)
   (b)    (1)    A declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each
taxable year, or within four months of the date the taxpayer first becomes
subject to the provisions of this section.
         (Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78; Ord. 1553-04. Passed 10-14-04.)
      (2)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration within four months after the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)    (1)    Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Director. Credit shall be taken in such declaration for the
Moraine tax to be withheld from any portion of such income and for income taxes
to be paid to another taxing Municipality for which credit is allowed against
the Moraine tax under Section
181.15.
      (2)    A declaration of estimated tax to be paid the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated tax; less
credit for taxes withheld or paid to another Municipality, and at least a
similar amount shall be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth
and thirteenth months after the beginning of the tax year.
      (3)    A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
   (d)    An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Director, if it appears that the
original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer's income by
thirty percent (30%) or more. At such time a payment which, together with prior
payments, is sufficient to pay taxpayer's entire estimated liability, shall be
made. If, upon the filing of the return required by Section
181.05 it appears that the taxpayer did not pay seventy percent (70%) of his
tax liability, as shown on such return, on or before January 31, or the date
fixed by regulations, whichever is applicable, the difference between seventy
percent (70%) of such taxpayer's tax liability and the amount of estimated tax
he actually paid on or before January 31, or the date fixed by regulation,
whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of Section
181.10.
   
   (e)    On or before the last day of the fourth month of the calendar or
fiscal year following that for which the declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City, shall be paid
therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
181.05. (Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78.)
181.08 DUTIES OF DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.

the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, and to keep an
accurate record thereof, and to report all moneys so received.
      (2)    It shall be the duty of the Director to enforce payment of all
income taxes owing the City, to keep accurate records, for a minimum of five

pertaining to the collection and payment of taxes and the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the re-
examination and correction of returns.
   (c)    In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Director may
determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the City from the taxpayer and
may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)    Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulation approved by the Board of Review, the Director shall have the power
to compromise any liability imposed by this section.
(Ord. 273B. Passed 8-24-78.)
181.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF DIRECTOR OF FINANCE; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    The Director, or any of his authorized agents, is hereby authorized
to examine the books, papers, records and Federal income tax returns of any
employer or taxpayer or any person subject to or whom the Director believes is
subject to the provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made, or if no return was made, to ascertain the tax or
withholdings due under this chapter. Every such employer, supposed employer,
taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish, upon
the written request of the Director, or his duly authorized agent or employee,
the means, facilities, and opportunity for making such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Director is hereby authorized to order any person, presumed to
have knowledge of the facts, to appear at the office of the Director and to
examine such person, under oath, concerning any income which was or should have
been returned for taxation, or withheld, or any transaction tending to affect
such income, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers,
records and Federal income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before
him, whether as parties or witnesses whenever he believes such persons have
knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject, or presumed to be subject, to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Director authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section

purposes. Any person divulging such information in violation of this section
shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for
not more than six months, or both. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate
offense. In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the City who
violates the provisions of this section relative to the disclosure of
confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable by immediate
dismissal.
(Ord. 1773-10. Passed 8-26-10.)
181.10 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)    Unpaid taxes. All taxes imposed and moneys withheld or required to be

   For the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)   DIRECTOR OF FINANCE. The Director of Finance of the City.
   (b)   HOTEL OR MOTEL. Every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are

the accommodation of the guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy uses or possess, or has the right to use or
possess all or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes.
   (d)   RENT. The consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (e)   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel or motel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in possession, or
any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a
managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the managing
agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall

provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall,
however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (f)   TRANSIENT GUESTS. Persons occupying a room or rooms for sleeping
accommodations for less than 30 consecutive days.
      (Ord. 1460-02. Passed 5-9-02.)
183.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue to meet the needs of the City,
for the use of the general fund of the City, there is levied a tax of 3% on all
rents received by a hotel or motel for lodging furnished to transient guests.
   (b)   The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.
   (c)   The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or
motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guests ceasing to occupy space in the hotel
or motel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel or motel, the Director of Finance may require that the tax shall be paid
directly to the Director of Finance. (Ord. 1460-02. Passed 5-9-02.)
183.03 EXEMPTIONS.

furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax applies.

occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for the occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof, and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,

tax and penalty of the previous 30 day period shall be added for each
successive 30 day period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud. If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of

portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Finance shall proceed
in a manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information upon which to

procure the facts and information as he is able to obtain on which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who

remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against the operator the
tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case the

known place of business. The operator may within 10 days after the serving or
mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Director of Finance
for hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance shall become final and
conclusive and immediately due and payable. If the application is made, the
director of finance shall give not less than 5 days written notice in the
manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place
fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for
the tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the operator may appear and
offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be
fixed. After the hearing, the Director of Finance shall determine the proper
tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in
the manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of the tax,
interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after

serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The City Manager shall fix
a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice in writing to
the operator at his last known place of business. The findings of the City
Manager shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in
the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found
to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 1460-02. Passed 5-9-02.)

(Ord. 1460-02. Passed 5-9-02.)

or paid more than once or had been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
divisions (b) and (c) of this section provided a claim in writing therefor,
stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is
founded, is filed with the Director of Finance within 3 years of the date of
payment. The claims shall be on forms furnished by the Director of Finance.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director of Finance that the person from whom the tax has
been collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected
has either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in division (a) of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director of

185.03  DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII (57) of the Ohio
Revised Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in
this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII (57) of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII (57)
of the Ohio Revised Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;

extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.

or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a

division (1)(H)(i) of this section.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of

treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed

individual's abode located outside of the Municipality and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

185.051 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
    (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
185.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
       (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
         (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
          (a)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the end of
each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.

   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
185.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
 
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
    (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   An employer with 150 or more W-2's shall file such information with the Tax
Administrator via email or CD. The Tax Administrator will provide in writing
format requirements for all such electronic filings. Any employer that will be
filing Withholding reconciliations with less than 150 W-2's may file in the
above electronic means. In addition to the Withholding Reconciliation Return,
any person required by Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-MISC.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the City when the services were performed in
Moraine. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the
name, address and social security number (or federal identification number),
and the amount of the payments made, Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in
lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on or before the
last day of February.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
 
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
 
   (K)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.
(Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)

      (6)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
          (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in section
185.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
          (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
       (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
 
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
 185.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, The Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
 
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that The Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
 185.051 of this Chapter.

agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
       (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
          (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
          (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
       If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
 
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
       (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount

amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
       (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
       (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
 
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
 
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
 
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax

185.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
          (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined
in Section
 185.03(23).
           (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
185.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
 185.052 of this Chapter;
       (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
          (a)    Separate accounting;
          (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
           (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
       (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
       (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by The Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
    (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
       (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
       (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
       (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
The Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
       (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
       (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
       (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
       (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
       (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
    (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 185.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
 185.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under section (A)(2) of this Section
185.062 of this Chapter on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (I)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to section (A)(2) of this Section
185.062.

185.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
       (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
       (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
       (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
       (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
 
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
          (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
          (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
       (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
 
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
 
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
185.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
       (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
 185.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
       (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
          (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
       (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
          (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
 
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
185.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

185.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO. 
   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job
retention in the Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit. (Ord. 1929-15. Passed

185.07  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
          (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
          (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
185.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
          (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
       (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
185.091 of this Chapter.
          (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
185.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

five per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
          (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
 
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
       (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
       (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

185.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
185.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPAILITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of this City is subject to a municipal income tax in
another municipality, the resident shall not pay a total municipal income tax
on the same income greater than the tax imposed at the highest rate to which
the resident is subject.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City who receives net
profits, pass-through entity income, qualifying wages, commissions, or other
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
City, and who is liable and has paid to another municipality an income tax on
the same income taxable and taxed under this chapter, shall be allowed a credit
against the tax imposed by this chapter (on the same income to the extent such
income is taxed under this chapter) of the amount paid by the taxpayer or on
the taxpayer's behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed
the Moraine tax imposed on the income earned in such other municipality(ies)
where such tax is paid. No credit shall be given for county or school district
taxes paid, but only for other municipal taxes paid.
  
   (C)   The amount of income earned in and taxed by a given municipality (as a
percentage of total income attributable to all taxing and non-taxing
jurisdictions) shall be used to determine each municipality's percentage
contribution to Moraine taxable income, prior to calculation of the resident's
credit for taxes paid to other municipalities on said income. The rate to be
used for calculation of this credit shall be the lesser of the resident's
Moraine city tax rate or the rate at which such income was taxed by such other
municipality.
   The resident's credit(s) for taxes paid to another municipality on net
profit income shall be calculated as follows:
   Moraine Net Profits Taxable Income $ Amount
            x
   Other Municipality's Percentage (%) Contribution to Moraine Taxable Income
            x
Lesser of Other Municipality's Percentage (%) Tax Rate or Moraine Percentage
(%) Tax Rate
   = Credit for Taxes Paid to another Municipality

185.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
       (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
    (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 185.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
  
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
185.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires the Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
185.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
 185.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
185.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the
refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
        (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

       (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other

the appropriate Tax Administrator.
       (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
       (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

          (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
       (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
 185.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter prevails.
  
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
 185.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
  
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
 185.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable
year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register
as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is
required by the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian

as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
    (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
 
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.

   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
       (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
185.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.

less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
185.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
        (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
185.18 of this Chapter.
 
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
       (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark

was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

185.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
185.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section

omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
 185.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If The Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
       (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
 
   (F)    The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds The Tax Administrator only with respect to
opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
 
   (H)    An opinion of The Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
 
   (I)    The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
 
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
       (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
        (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members who
may be domiciled in the Municipality but the legislative authority may consider
membership from individuals not domiciled in the Municipality.
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment.
One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official of the
Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not
be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
       (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
         (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
       (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever The Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
 
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
 
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
          (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
       (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
185.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
 
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
 
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
 
    (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
185.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
185.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
       (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 1929-15. Passed 11-12-15.)
185.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.

the internet.

185.201 LANDLORD REPORTING/TENANT REGISTRATION.
   Every person/business who owns any interest in one or more rental units
shall furnish to the Tax Administrator a list of the names of all the persons,
leasing, renting, or otherwise occupying such rental unit or units. Such list
shall be filed annually on or before the last day of July of each year on a
form provided by the Tax Administrator, unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension. If such persons fail to provide the above information to the Tax
Administrator, they shall be liable under the provisions of Section
185.99.
(Ord. 2151-23. Passed 12-14-23.)
185.202 LEASE REPORTING.

annually on or before the last day of July of each year on a form provided by
the Tax Administrator, unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension. If
such persons fail to provide the able information to the Director, they shall

remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Municipality of its
termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)   The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred

      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties
imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/718.01of the
Revised Code and Section
185.03 of the Municipality Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.81 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
185.82 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/
718.01of the Revised Code and section
 185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division E(3)(b) of
section 185.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division E(3)(b) of section
185.86 of the Codified Ordinances.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(B)(i) of section
 185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (47)(B)(i) of section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
185.03 (47)(A) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
185.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.82    APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality and that has made the election under section
185.80 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
 185.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
 185.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
185.90 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the Municipality only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the Municipality
from a stock of goods located within the Municipality.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the Municipality from a
location outside the Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in the
Municipality.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to the Municipality.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Municipality shall be sitused to
the Municipality.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the Municipality.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Municipality in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Municipality based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Municipality to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (II)(L) of section
185.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Municipality or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the
Municipality any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Municipality
under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

         (Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.85 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

information.
         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax

required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may

   (D)   (1)   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with sections
185.011 through

   (E)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the

tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.851  ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section

185.86 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
185.80 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
185.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section
 185.80 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
185.81 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
185.81 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
185.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
185.82 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in section
185.82 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
185.82 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.87 FAILURE TO PAY.

185.80 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
185.90 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first. (Ord. 1995-18.
Passed 2-22-18.)
185.88  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.89 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount

      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
 185.91 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
 185.90 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.90  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
185.91 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
 185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
185.91 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. (Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.91 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
185.90 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 1995-18. Passed
2-22-18.)
185.92  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
185.80 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
185.90 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
185.91 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in section
185.91 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.93  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
185.80 to
185.95 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
185.80 to
 185.95 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Municipality and taxpayer under section
185.064 or
185.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any

(Ord. 1995-18. Passed 2-22-18.)
185.97  COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.
      (3)   The court may impose any other penalty authorized under Sections
2929.21 to 2929.28 of the Ohio Revised Code. However, the court shall not

offense and Section 2901.20 of the Ohio Revised Code does not apply. The
designation of this offense as a strict liability offense shall not be
construed to imply that any other offense, for which there is no specified
degree of culpability, is not a strict liability offense.
   (e)   This section shall not be construed as invalidating, preempting, or
superseding a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance that prescribes
penalties for violations of this ordinance that are greater than the penalties
prescribed in this section for violations of this section.
   
   (f)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance based on the same conduct. However, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Section 2941.25 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
   (g)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar for a violation of subsection (a) of
this section shall inform the operator that the operator may decline a search

voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the

      (2)   If the person previously has been adjudicated a delinquent child or
a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section, whoever violates
this section shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00). In addition, the
court shall impose a class seven suspension of the person’s driver’s license or
permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two
offenses are allied offenses of similar import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.

section, the court may order, for thirty days, the immobilization of the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

jurisdiction in which the person’s license or permit was issued, shall operate
any motor vehicle upon the public roads and highways or upon any public or

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

4510.14 or Ohio R.C. 4510.16, or Ohio R.C. 4510.21 or Ohio R.C. 4510.037 or of
a substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any
other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (h)    Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having
jurisdiction of the offense that lead to the order terminates the forfeiture
and notifies the Registrar of the termination. The Registrar shall then take
necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased

safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any
recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded. The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a Municipal, Count or State sealer with
the State- standards or standards approved by the State and such scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on highways,
they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width to
accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be level, or
if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-fourth
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   In all determination of all weights, except gross weight, by compact, self-
contained, portable sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel
loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less apart,
shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside
wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use of
compact, self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14 inclusive.

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

      (2)   As used in this subsection:

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
 
501.13 CONSPIRACY.

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.

pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
5         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

   Within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this section, every
alarm user shall obtain an alarm user permit for each alarm system within this
City from the Chief of Police.
   (a)   An alarm user’s permit application shall contain: names and addresses
of the alarm users and of the residence or business or businesses in or upon
which the alarm system has been or will be installed, and telephone number. The
type of alarm system (local, direct connect, central station), the alarm
business company name, address and telephone, installing, monitoring,
inspecting, responding to or maintaining the alarm system. The names,
addresses, telephone numbers of three (3) persons who can be contacted twenty-
four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, to turn off or deactivate the
alarm system when the alarm user cannot be contacted. It shall be the
responsibility and obligation of the alarm user to keep the above information
current and accurate by notifying the Police Department in writing within ten
(10) days after a change occurs.
   (b)   Each alarm user shall pay to the City, upon application for permit, an
alarm user fee of ten dollars ($10.00). This permit shall expire annually on
December 31 after issuance and shall not be prorated. All permits shall be
renewed annually in accordance with procedures established by the Police

      (Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)
542.11 EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS.
   If any alarm system produces three (3) false alarms in any twelve (12)
consecutive month period, written notice of that fact shall be given by regular
mail or delivery to the subscriber.
   (a)   If more than three (3) false alarms are produced by any alarm system
in a twelve (12) month period, an administrative fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
shall be assessed against the alarm user for the fourth false alarm, and an
administrative fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be assessed for each
successive false alarm thereafter. These fees shall be in addition to any
criminal penalties imposed under Section
542.99. Such charges shall continue for each successive false alarm until six
(6) consecutive months have elapsed during which time no false alarms have been
recorded. At that time the record will be cleared and the next false alarm
shall be deemed to be the first such incident. The question of whether a false
alarm has occurred may be appealed by the alarm user under the applicable
procedures set forth later in Section
542.19 by an alarm user who has been assessed a false alarm administrative fee.
   (b)   The permit issued to an alarm user may be revoked with the result that
the alarm user be required to disconnect the alarm system in such fashion that
signals are not emitted so as to notify the Police Department either directly
or indirectly. The procedure for such orders to disconnect is set forth in
Section
542.18.
   (c)   For the purposes of this section, a false alarm shall not be deemed to
have occurred:
      (1)   If caused by some factor not within the control of the alarm user,
(e.g. equipment malfunction, phone line disruption, extremely severe weather,
etc), and
      (2)   If that cause is verified within forty-five (45) days of the false
alarm by a letter from the applicable alarm business, which letter identifies
the problem, declares that it has been resolved, and describes the corrective
measures that were taken.
   (d)   An alarm system may be reconnected only if satisfactory evidence is
provided to the Chief of Police that the alarm system has been repaired so that
it does not emit further false alarms and upon payment of all delinquent
charges assessed for false alarms.
      (Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)
542.12 SPECIFIC ALARM PROVISIONS (ENTRANCE/EXIT).
   (a)   All alarm installations incorporating an entrance/exit device must
permit a delay of twenty (20) seconds minimum before actual activation of the
system.
   (b)   Automatic Dialing or Calling Devices. Alarm systems that automatically
dial or call the Police Department must be called on a special telephone line
designated by the Police/Fire Department and shall comply with the following:
      (1)   Total length of the recorded message being transmitted to the
Police Department (including repetition of message) shall not exceed forty-five
(45) seconds duration.
      (2)   The recorded message transmitted shall be repeated not less than
three (3) nor more than four (4) times and shall have an automatic abort
feature to ensure this requirement.
      (3)   The recorded message being transmitted shall incorporate language
specifically identifying the message as a “recording” with the balance of the
message, identifying by street number and street name, the location of the
emergency and the nature of the event which caused the alarm system to
activate. If the location of the event signaled by the alarm system is in a
multi-family building, the message shall also identify, by number and by floor,
this particular dwelling unit, office unit, or commercial unit in which the
event occurred.
      (4)   The recorded message being transmitted to the Police Department
shall be appropriate for the purpose for which the alarm system was installed,
and the message in its entirety shall be intelligible and spoken in the English
language.
   (c)   Local Alarm. The local alarm shall not resemble the sound of any
emergency signal or civil defense alarm or siren. All local alarms shall have
the capacity to reset themselves within fifteen (15) minutes from the time it
was activated.
   (d)   Instructions. Every alarm business selling, leasing, or furnishing to
any user an alarm system which is installed on premises located within the
City, shall furnish the user with instructions that provide information to
enable the user to operate the alarm system properly and to obtain service for
the alarm system at any time.
   (e)   Emergency Alarm Buttons. Emergency alarm buttons are to be used only
to send an automatic alarm to signal an unauthorized entry or a robbery to the
Police Department.
      (1)   The activation of a panic alarm is intended to signal the Police
and Fire Departments of the City of an emergency situation.
      (2)   Therefore, through the use of a device of this nature, the user
grants to the Police Department the right to conduct any investigation deemed
necessary to investigate and verify the authenticity of the alarm.
      (3)   It shall be deemed a violation of this chapter if a panic device is
activated for anything other than that specified in this section.

542.14 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

appropriately upon receipt of an alarm from such a device, nor for the failure
or neglect of any person with a license issued pursuant to this chapter or with
a franchise, in connection with the installation and operation of equipment,
nor for the failure of the transmission of alarm signals and pre-recorded alarm
messages, or the relaying of such signals and messages. In the event that the
City finds it necessary to disconnect a defective automatic dialing system or
signaling device, the City shall incur no liability by such action.
(Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)

interconnected to the Police Department shall be exempt from the revocation and
disconnect order sections of this chapter but shall be subject to the
administrative fee assessments as described in Section
542.11 and shall also be subject to the criminal penalties for violation of
this chapter as provided in Section
542.99.
(Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)
542.17 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter is
for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of
the remaining portions of this chapter. Council hereby declares that it would
have passed this chapter, and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, and
phrase hereof, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more of the
sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases might be declared invalid.
(Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)
542.18 ORDER TO DISCONNECT.
   (a)   In addition to the administrative fees described in Section
542.11, and in addition to any criminal penalties imposed under Section
542.99, an alarm user who has more than six (6) false alarms in a twelve (12)
month period (calculated as described in Section 542.11) and who is deemed by
the Community Relations Officer in the Police Department not to have made
reasonable efforts toward correction of the false alarm situation, shall be
issued an order to disconnect the alarm system so that signals are not emitted
to notify the Police Department either directly or indirectly.
   A similar order to disconnect shall be issued to any alarm user who has
failed to deliver to the City full payment for any administrative fee levied
under Section
542.11 (for excessive false alarms) within thirty (30) days after written
notice of that fee has been mailed or otherwise delivered to the last known
address of the alarm user or to the address at which the alarm system is

obtain a user’s permit as required by Section

appeal under the procedures set forth in Section
542.19. Any disconnect order must refer to this right to appeal. If such an
appeal is filed, the disconnection is to be completed within ten (10) days
after similar delivery of notice of the appellate decision, if that decision
sustained the disconnect order.
   (d)   Once disconnected, an alarm system may be reconnected only if so
ordered by the Chief of Police in a decision on an appeal or if a preponderance
of the credible evidence available to the Community Relations Officer
indicates:
      (1)   That the alarm system has been repaired so it will not emit further
false alarms; or
      (2)   If the disconnect order was based on failure to pay assessments
when due, that all delinquent false alarm fees have been paid in full; or
      (3)   If the disconnect order has been based upon failure to register or
re-register so as to obtain a permit and keep it in effect as required by
Section
542.10, that registration had been completed so as to obtain an original or
renewal of a user’s permit.
         (Ord. 1060-94. Passed 2-10-94.)

reasonable efforts toward correction of a false alarm situation may appeal the
determination that such reasonable efforts were not made.
      (3)   An alarm user subject to an order to disconnect for failure to
obtain or renew a user’s permit as required by Section
542.10 may appeal the issue of whether or not that use had a permit in effect
for the location in question or was required by this chapter to have such a
permit.
      (4)   An alarm user subject to an order to disconnect for failure to pay
when due an administrative fee assessed under Section
542.11 for excessive false alarms may appeal the issue of whether or not such
payment was made on time.
   
   (b)   A written request for an appeal must be submitted to the Chief of
Police within ten (10) days after notice of the false alarm administrative fee
or of a disconnect order was mailed or otherwise delivered to the last known
address of the alarm user or to the address at which the alarm system is
located. The alarm user-appellant shall have the right to present written and
oral evidence to the Chief of Police at a hearing on the appeal and shall have
the burden of proving his or her case by a preponderance of the credible
evidence. Notice of the hearing date, hour and place shall be mailed or
otherwise delivered to the last known address of the appellant or to the
address at which the alarm system is located at least ten (10) days prior to
the hearing.
   The Chief of Police may sustain, modify or reverse the decisions appealed

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
 545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06 or
 545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

559.01 PURPOSE.
   Public nuisance properties as defined herein present health, safety, and
welfare concerns to the City, and have a negative impact upon the quality of
life, safety, and health of the neighborhoods in which they are located. Said
nuisances create a financial burden to the City as a result of calls for
service for nuisance activities which repeatedly occur at these locations. This
Chapter is enacted to, inter alia, lessen that burden and hold accountable
those persons responsible for said properties, and remedy nuisance activities
which occur in the City and affect citizens by providing a process for
abatement. (Ord. 2123-22. Passed 9-8-22.)

use(s) constituting the public nuisance is terminated.
   (b)   "Public Nuisance Appeals Board": Whenever reference is made in this
Chapter to a Public Nuisance Appeals Board, it is referring to the Board of

Director and the City Law Director will conduct a legal review of the appeal
process.
   (c)   "Owner(s)": The owner of record of the fee of the premises or lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee, vendee in possession, land contract purchaser,
assignee of the rents, receiver, executor, administrator, trustee, or lessee,
as determined by an examination of the public records of Montgomery County,
Ohio, or any other person, firm corporation or entity in control of a building
or structure, or their duly authorized agents.
   (d)   "Persons Responsible or Responsible Person": Any person or persons,

separate part or portion thereof, which has any or all of the conditions
hereinafter described, shall be deemed to be a public nuisance.
      (1)   The following conditions or defects shall constitute a public
nuisance when they endanger the life, health, property, safety, or welfare of

such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation of
Sections

734.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate sexually
oriented businesses, to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the citizens of Moraine, Ohio, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent any injurious location and concentration of sexually
oriented businesses within Moraine (“City”), and to regulate their operation,
thereby reducing and/or eliminating the negative effects from sexually oriented
businesses.
   The provisions outlined in this chapter do not have the purpose or effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Likewise, the intent and
effect of this chapter is not to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually
oriented materials protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the
United States, or to refuse access by the distributors and exhibitors of
sexually oriented entertainment to their projected market. The intent and
effect of this chapter is also not to condone or legitimize the distribution of
obscene or otherwise illegal materials, goods or activities.
   (b)   Findings: Based on evidence concerning the negative secondary effects
of sexually oriented businesses on the community on findings incorporated in
the cases of the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986)
and Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and in the studies in
other cities including Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Whittier,
California; and Phoenix, Arizona; this Council finds and is concerned that:
      (1)   Sexually Oriented Businesses lend themselves to unlawful and
unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex, and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually
oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable
diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (4)   Numerous studies have reported that semen is reported in sexually
oriented businesses that show sexually oriented films.
      (5)   Sexually oriented businesses should be regulated to protect
substantial government concerns.
      (6)   The City has determined that a licensing procedure is an
appropriate mechanism/regulation on the owners and operators of sexually
oriented businesses. This licensing procedure will ensure that sexually
oriented businesses are managed in a way that is consistent with health,
safety, and welfare of patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
City.
      (7)   Regulating nudity in sexually oriented businesses will further the
substantial government interests in preventing prostitution and other sex
crimes, including but not limited to illegal sex acts, and protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
      (8)   Removing doors in viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting
in sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial government
interest in curbing illegal and unsanitary sexual activities occurring in adult
arcades and theaters.
      (9)   Disclosing certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented
businesses, and by employees of such businesses, will facilitate enforcing the
provisions of this chapter and other federal, state, and local laws, and will
thereby further the substantial government interest in protecting the public
health, safety, and welfare.
      (10)   A person having recently been convicted of a sexually related
crime is not an appropriate person to own, operate, or be employed in a
sexually oriented business.
Barring above individuals from the management of and employment in sexually
oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents
the commission of sexually related criminal acts, including but not limited to
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

which:
         A.   Less than two (2) years have elapsed since the date of
conviction, the date of completion of probation, or the date of the release
from confinement, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a
misdemeanor offense for the “specified criminal acts”;
         B.   Less than five (5) years have elapsed since the date of
conviction, the date of completion of probation, or the date of release from
confinement, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a felony
offense, for the violation of the “specified criminal act”;
      (7)   The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect
on disqualification of the applicant.

criminal acts” may qualify for a sexually oriented business permit only after
the time period required above has elapsed.
   (d)   If the City Manager, or person designated by the City, denies the
application, he/she shall promptly notify the applicant of the denial in
writing and state the reason(s) for the denial.

period of twelve (12) months from the date of denial of a previous application
for a permit at the same location, and there has not been an intervening change
in the circumstances which could reasonably be expected to lead to a different
decision regarding the former reasons for denial, the application shall be
denied. (Ord. 1543-04. Passed 8-26-04.)

Manager, or person designated by the City Manager, determines that the basis

individual or individuals committed an offense, occurring in or on the

   Prompt Judicial Review:
The City is aware of the Constitutional requirement to provide prompt judicial
review to persons affected by this chapter. Since the City cannot legally
mandate the timing of judicial review in these matters, the City has created a
right to a temporary permit or the continuation of a permit to maintain the
status quo for these persons while they seek quasi-judicial and judicial review
to prevent the suppression of speech or expression protected by the First
Amendment to the Constitution.

or perform services pursuant to a temporary permit which shall be issued by the

the controlling legislative intent that if any provisions of said chapter, or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid,
the remaining sections or provisions and the application of such sections and
provisions to any person or circumstances other than those to which it is held
invalid, shall not be affected thereby, and it is hereby declared that such
sections and provisions would have been passed independently if such section or

751.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter, certain terms are defined as follows:
   (a)    "Taxicab" means any vehicle by means of which individual service for
compensation in the transportation of people on the public streets is furnished
or offered to be furnished. Vehicles furnishing mass transportation of persons,
such as trolley coaches and gasoline buses which are operated on fixed routes
and schedules or between fixed termini, are expressly excluded.
   (b)    "Compensation" means any fare, reward or donation or other thing of
value which a driver or owner of a vehicle accepts or receives in return for
furnishing taxicab service.
   (c)    "Taxicab operator" means any person, firm or corporation engaged in
the taxicab business excepting a driver as defined in subsection (d) hereof. It
is the intent of this definition that anyone who drives a taxicab in any
capacity other than as an employee shall be deemed to be an operator and shall
in addition to being licensed as a driver also be required to be licensed as an
operator.
   (d)    "Taxicab driver" means any person driving a taxicab. It is the intent
of this definition that when the owner or lessee of a taxicab engaged in the
driving thereof, in addition to being licensed as an operator, he shall also be
qualified and licensed as a driver.
   (e)    "Taxicab stand" means any space on any street or way designated by
the City Manager as a proper place for the exclusive use of taxicabs awaiting
patronage.
   (f)    "Taximeter" means a mechanical device by which the fee due for the
hire of the taxicab is mechanically computed upon the distance traveled and
upon the waiting time, upon the face of which device such charge is indicated
by figures.
   (g)    "Waiting time" means the time during which the taxicab is not in
motion while standing at the passenger's orders. No charge shall be made for
any time lost by reason of delay caused by mechanical difficulties of the
taxicab, time lost by premature arrival in response to a call or en route to
the destination because of any traffic conditions or delays.
   (h)    "Public convenience and necessity" means a genuine need for
additional taxicab transportation facilities in order to adequately and
properly serve the needs and convenience of the general public of the City of
Moraine. In the determination as to whether public convenience and necessity
requires the issuance of additional licenses, consideration shall be given the
following:
      (1)    The resulting effect upon the business of the then existing
holders of licenses and upon the existing agencies of mass transportation;
      (2)    The effect on traffic congestion and safety of the public streets;
      (3)    The effect upon working conditions and wages or other compensation
paid to drivers of taxicabs of existing holders of licenses;
      (4)    Whether persons holding licenses for the operation of taxicabs
are, under normal conditions, adequately serving the public; and
      (5)    Whether the requirements of public convenience and necessity can
be adequately met and complied with only by the issuance of additional
licenses.
   (i)    "Finance Director" means the Finance Director of the City of Moraine
or his designated representative.
   (j)    "Chief of Police" means the Chief of Police of the City of Moraine or

      (Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.02 CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY; BOARD CREATED.
   (a)    No taxicab operator's licenses to operate a particular taxicab or
taxicabs shall be issued unless a Board consisting of the City Manager,
Director of Finance and Chief of Police shall make a recommendation as to the
issuance of additional operator's licenses in such number as may be set forth
in the order so made and certified to the Finance Director, which
recommendation shall be subject to ratification by Council.
   Upon receipt of such ratification and the compliance with such other
requirements as may hereafter be set forth, the Finance Director shall be
authorized to issue the specified additional number of operator's licenses to
the person, firm or corporation named in such order, in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. The Board shall hold public hearings at such times
as are reasonably necessary to consider operator's licenses requests submitted
to the Board which meeting shall be for the purpose of determining whether or
not public convenience and necessity requires the issuance of such additional
operator's licenses, the number of such licenses, if any, so required, and the
person, firm or corporation to which such operator's licenses should be issued.
All interested parties shall have the right to submit memoranda to and be heard
by such Board at such public hearing with relation to such determination.
   (b)    Application for such orders and certification thereof shall be made
by filing the same with the Finance Director not less than thirty days prior to
the date of public hearing thereon. All applications shall be deemed to be
public records and shall be available for inspection by all interested persons
in the office of the Finance Director.
(Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.03 TAXICAB OPERATOR'S LICENSE.
   (a)    No person, firm or corporation shall engage in the business of
operating one or more taxicabs within the City without first obtaining and at
all times maintaining in full force and effect, a taxicab operator's license
for each taxicab so operated.
   (b)    Application shall be made for a taxicab operator's license by filing
the same with the Finance Director by any person, partnership, corporation or
receiver for any of the aforementioned desiring to engage in the business of
operating one or more taxicabs with the City. Each applicant, except
corporations, and if a partnership, each partner, shall possess the following
qualifications:
      (1)    He shall be twenty-one years of age, able to speak and read the
English language; and
      (2)    He shall be of good moral character, which qualifications shall be
supported by the affidavits of two reputable residents of Moraine.
   (c)    Application for an operator's license shall be denied if the
provisions enumerated in Section
751.02 have not been met with relation thereto. An operator's license may be
denied to any applicant who has been convicted of a felonious offense under
state or Federal law. The license shall be denied in the event of a conviction
of the applicant or any employee of the applicant of any offense involving
gambling, illegal traffic in intoxicating liquor, or in narcotics, or against
public morals. However, for a conviction of such offenses by an employee, the
application may be processed upon the applicant's furnishing satisfactory
evidence that such employee has been dismissed from the applicant's employment.
By and with the approval of the Police Department, an operator's license may be
denied to anyone who has been convicted of knowingly transporting or assisting
in the transportation of persons engaged in either illegal liquor or narcotic
traffic or in prostitution. When the applicant is a corporation, it shall be a
corporation duly authorized to do business under the laws of the State of Ohio
for the purpose of engaging in the business of operating taxicabs. Each
applicant shall, if an individual, present himself in person, if a partnership,
by one partner, if a corporation, by its president or general manager, to the
Chief of Police for an examination as to his qualifications and shall answer
fully and truly all questions addressed to him tending to disclose whether or
not the applicant possesses the above-named qualifications. Upon a satisfactory
finding thereof by the Chief of Police and a recommendation by him, if such
certificate of convenience and necessity is issued by the Board and all other
qualifications met by the applicant, the Finance Director shall issue the
license as applied for. The qualifications required above for individual
applicants shall likewise be met and complied with by each partner in the case
of a partnership and by principal officers of a corporation, including the
president, vice president, secretary and treasurer, and the managing officer or
superintendent. Such operator's licenses shall be transferred upon application
duly filed with the Finance Director by the person, firm or corporation to whom
it is proposed to transfer a license, provided such person, firm or corporation
shall meet and comply with all the requirements as set forth herein.
   (d)    Such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit or other
suitable evidence in writing from the person, firm or corporation holding such
license indicating his agreement to such transfer. (Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.04 TAXICAB SERVICE.
   All persons, firms or corporations, engaged in the taxicab business in the
City operating under the provisions of this chapter shall render a continuous
and overall service to the public. Holders of operator's licenses shall
maintain a central place of business and an office in the City and keep the
same open twenty-four hours daily to receive calls and dispatch cabs. They
shall respond to all such calls, as are by them received for service as soon as
they can do so, and in the event that services cannot be furnished within a
reasonable time, they shall notify the prospective passenger how long it will
be before the service can be furnished and state the reason therefor. Any
hauler who refuses to accept a call anywhere within the corporate limits of the
City when cabs are available therefor, or who fails or refuses, excepting for
conditions beyond his control, to furnish continuous and overall service, shall
be deemed to have violated this section and the license by him held may be
revoked at the discretion of the Finance Director. At the time of any
application for an operator's license, the applicant shall, in addition to
other requirements of this chapter, demonstrate his ability to provide the
service required by this section.
(Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.05 OPERATOR'S FEE; BOND OR INSURANCE POLICY.
   (a)    A fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per cab per annum shall be
paid to the City. This fee shall be collected only once although the particular
taxicab may be used as a taxicab by more than one operator. As to the licenses
issued between January 1 and June 31 of any year, the fee shall be one-half of
the foregoing amount. Each applicant shall also file with the Finance Director
at the time of the payment of such fee a good and sufficient indemnity bond or
liability insurance policy issued by a company licensed to do business in the
State of Ohio, payable to the City, and for the benefit of any person or
persons injured either in person or property, which bond or insurance policy
shall be in the sum of twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500) for each
person injured and with a total liability of twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000) for any one accident, and seven thousand five hundred dollars
($7,500) damage coverage, which bond or policy of insurance shall be maintained
in such sums at all times and until every claim against such operator for
damages, injuries or death incurred or suffered by property or persons, through
neglect or wrongful act of the taxicab operator, his or its agents or
employees, in the policy shall be so conditioned that the taxicabs of the
operator will be operated in accordance with the laws of Ohio and the Charter
and ordinances of the City, and that any judgment rendered in any court against
such operator arising out of damage or injury to any person or property caused
by the operation of such taxicab and due to the negligence or wrongful acts of
the operator's agents or employees shall be paid. Such bond or insurance shall
further contain express provisions to the effect that it shall not become void
on first recovery but may be sued upon and recovery had from time to time until
the full amount is exhausted. In the event of payment of damages by either the
surety or insurer, the operator shall at once give additional bond in the
amount so paid to the end that there shall be at all times in effect the
principal sum herein specified available for compensation as aforesaid. Further
provisions shall be contained in either such bond or insurance policy that the
bankruptcy or insolvency of the operator shall not release the surety or
insurer from the payment required, but shall remain in full force and effect
and available to any person injured the same as though the operator was not
insolvent or bankrupt. Provided further that any such bond or policy may make
provisions for compensation for damages caused only to the property of any
person other than licensee in the sum of not less than ten thousand dollars
($10,000).
   (b)    Such policy or bond shall further provide that no notice of any acts
creating any liability thereunder shall be required and that the bond or policy
shall not be canceled before ten days written notice of the intention to cancel
has been given to the Finance Director and that such bond or policy shall
remain in full force and effect until after the expiration of ten days from the
date of service of such written notice. Such bond or policy shall be renewed
annually to the satisfaction of the Finance Director.
(Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.06 FORM OF OPERATOR'S LICENSE.
   Upon compliance with the applicable conditions enumerated herein, an
operator's license shall be issued by the Finance Director for a period
expiring June 30, next unless sooner revoked in such form as approved by him,
containing a statement of the number of cabs then used by the operator, the
make and motor number of each cab, the registration number hereafter prescribed
and any other information reasonably regarded as property by the Finance
Director. The taxicab registration tag shall be of metal three inches by five
inches in size and of the same color scheme as the then current State vehicle
license. This tag shall be attached to the outside right front door of the cab,
either to the rear of the upper hinge or below the body stripe. Each tag shall
contain one of a series of consecutive numbers to be known as taxi registration
numbers, the expiration date and such other information as the Finance Director
may reasonably require. No licensee or any taxicab driver shall operate or use
any such cab as such unless the tag is affixed in the manner above provided, or
operate or use any cab as such with any license tag other than the tag
originally assigned to that taxicab or to transfer such tags from one cab to
another. However, such registration tags may be transferred upon written
notification to the Finance Director of a desire by the holder so to do. This
notice shall contain the registration number of the tag proposed to be
transferred and the motor numbers of the taxicabs from and to which the
transfer is to be made. Such written notice shall be endorsed upon the license
of the operator and upon the records of the Police Department. The Finance
Director shall file and keep an index record of all operator's licenses, bonds
and policies presented, and fees paid, together with the name, office and place
of business of all licensees. The taxicab registration numbers, motor numbers
and make of each taxicab shall be kept and maintained by the Police Department
together with such other information as it may reasonably require.
(Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.07 TAXIMETERS REQUIRED.
   (a)    No person shall operate or permit to be operated in the City any
taxicab on a distance tariff or transport passengers in or offer for hire, any
taxicab unless such vehicle is equipped with a taximeter that has been approved
by the Police Department. No person shall operate or drive a taxicab unless
such taximeter is used in determining the fare to be charged and no other or
different fare shall be charged than is recorded on the reading face of such
taximeter for the trip, except that the hourly rate may be used by previous
arrangement with the passengers after the meter has registered an amount equal
to that of the first hour conforming to the rates as herein provided for. No
other methods of figuring rates, amount due or measuring distances shall be
allowed.
   (b)    No person shall operate or drive any taxicab equipped with a
taximeter, in public service, with the case of such taximeter not sealed and
the cover and gear thereof not intact. No person shall operate or drive any
taxicab after sundown, without having the face of the taximeter thereon
illuminated as hereinafter provided; or drive such taxicab without having the
taximeter set and regulated to conform with the requirements as set forth by
law. All taximeters and the power take-off gear box shall be sealed by the
Police Department and shall at all times bear this seal when operating. Every
such meter and gear box may be inspected by the Police Department at periodic
intervals as determined by the Department. It shall be the responsibility of
both the operator and the driver to ascertain that the meter and gear box are
sealed before driving any taxicab within the City. Every taximeter shall be
equipped with a suitable light so arranged as to throw a steady light on the
face thereof. The owners of such taxicabs so equipped shall present to the
Police Department as frequently as they may require, the certificate of the
manufacturer or lessor of such taximeters that each taximeter in use is in good
working order and that it does accurately indicate the fare due to be paid upon
the distance traveled and the waiting time, in a manner not to exceed the
maximum rates of fare prescribed in Section
751.17.
(Ord. 390. Passed 6-20-73.)
751.08 REVOCATION OF OPERATOR'S LICENSE.
   (a)    The Board, subject to Council's approval, may revoke the license of
any taxicab operator who is convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of
any of the following offenses:

      (2)    Permitting a taxicab to be operated for hire by one not licensed

      (2)    Offenses against public morals; or
      (3)    The possession, sale or any illegal trafficking in narcotics.
   (c)    The transportation of any person convicted of any of the foregoing
offenses with knowledge that they were engaged in such a violation shall
likewise be grounds for the revocation of the operator's license.
   (d)    If the person convicted is an employee, an executive officer of a
corporate operator, or a partner in a firm or partnership, the license shall be
revoked only if it appears that such operator sanctioned, aided in or had
knowledge of the offense for which conviction was had. Upon revocation of any
operator's license, the Finance Director shall cause a notice in writing to be
served upon or left at the usual place of business of such licensee, whereupon
it shall be the duty of the licensee to surrender his licenses to the Finance
Director together with all taxicab registration tags. It shall thereafter be
unlawful for such operator to engage in the taxicab business until a new
license has been issued to him. No new license shall be issued to such licensee
for a period of five years from the time of such revocation. In the event of a
subsequent conviction of an operator for the violation of any of the offenses
in this section set forth, his license shall be permanently revoked and no
further license shall be issued.

conviction of the same taxicab driver of any of the offenses set forth in this
chapter, his driver's license shall be permanently revoked and no license shall
thereafter be issued to him. The Board may revoke the driver's license of any
applicant who has made false answer to any material question in the application

   (a)   A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any
System in the City shall:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the Provider's
obligations for its System in the Rights of Way under this chapter and any
other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other Laws that have been lawfully
assumed by another Applicant and/or Provider; or
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner that
promotes the City's goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize a potentially limited Rights of Way

to a useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of O.R.C. Sections 4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of
the Facilities by the Provider or by the Provider's surety. If the City

(Ord. 1697-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
901.06 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the Rights of Way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the City for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in
accordance with Codified Ordinances Chapter
901 and any associated Permit. For those Providers with a valid gas or electric
franchise, the provisions of a Certificate of Registration shall be deemed as
regulatory in nature and shall not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy
the Rights of Way which may have been granted by such franchise. The right to
occupy the Right of Way itself may not be subdivided or subleased; provided,
however, that two or more Providers may collocate Facilities in the same area
of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider complies with the provisions
of this Chapter. Collocating Providers may file a joint application for a Right
of Way Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from
obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before collocating
its Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City's Facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in
or on the Provider's System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not
cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of this Chapter. A
Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying with any
provisions of this Chapter and other applicable Laws. (Ord. 1697-08. Passed 1-
24-08.)
901.07 OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration
issued pursuant to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the City.

locations and collocation configurations are preferred. A preferred location
and collocation configuration should be utilized whenever possible and should
only be surpassed if in the determination of the City Manager or his/her
designee, clear and convincing evidence supports such a decision. Cost alone
should not be grounds for such a determination. The order of preference is as
follows:
            (a)   First, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no
such pole or wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next
preference;
            (b)   Second, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole or wireless support structure within an alley. If no such pole or
wireless support structure is available then proceed to the next preference;
            (c)   Third, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within a utility easement. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            (d)   Fourth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure within an alley. If no such location is available
then proceed to the next preference;
            (e)   Fifth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a
wireless support structure currently supporting a small cell facility located
within the City Right of Way. If no such wireless support structure is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            (f)   Sixth, small cell facilities should be collocated on an
existing pole located within the City Right of Way. If no such existing pole is
available then proceed to the next preference;
            (g)   Seventh, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within a utility easement. If no such
location is available then proceed to the next preference;
            (h)   Eighth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within an alley. If no such location is
available then proceed to the next preference
            (i)   Ninth, small cell facilities should be collocated on a new
wireless support structure located within the City Right of Way.
         B.   Any new wireless support structure shall be located at least
1230' from any existing small cell facility.
      (3)   Wireless Facilities Design

strategic painting or coating to camouflage such enclosure or equipment.
            (h)   The maximum height of any such enclosure shall be 30".
   (c)   Reservation of Right of Way.  The City reserves the right to reserve
space for future public safety or transportation uses in the Right of Way or on
a wireless support structure or pole owned or operated by the City in a
documented and approved plan in place at the time an application is filed. A
reservation of space shall not preclude placement of a pole or collocation of a
small cell facility. If replacement of the City's pole or wireless support
structure is necessary to accommodate the collocation of the small cell
facility and the future use, the small cell facility operator shall pay for the
replacement of the pole or wireless support structure, and the replaced pole or
wireless support structure must accommodate the future use.

siting, landscaping, and camouflaging techniques to blend Facilities into their
environment, while enhancing the ability of service providers to deploy
Facilities in the City quickly, effectively, and efficiently so that residents,
businesses, and visitors benefit from ubiquitous and robust service
availability.
      (3)    The Placement Rules are intended to allow sufficient flexibility
to respond to and integrate future advances in technology as well as
innovations that improve the ability for these facilities to integrate into the
surrounding environment. Due to the rapid advances in technology, the Placement
Rules will be evaluated, and amended, periodically to ensure that the
provisions respond and adapt accordingly to these evolving technologies.
    (b)   Definitions. Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used
in these Design Guidelines will have the same meaning attributed to them in
Moraine Codified Ordinances Chapter
901.
   (c)   Applicability. Placement, modification, and removal of any Facility
shall comply with these Placement Rules. For requirements related to Small Cell
Facilities and Wireless Support Structures, reference Codified Ordinance

service provider’s gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this
chapter.

the City Manager or his designee shall have the authority to sign all documents
necessary for the cremation of the deceased body.
   (c)   Prior to the cremation authorization, the City shall make reasonable
attempt to determine whether or not the deceased person is in fact indigent as
follows:
   The term “indigent decedent” means a person who dies without leaving an
ascertainable estate sufficient to pay part or all of the person’s burial
expenses and whose burial expenses are not payable by the State, except that
decedents who earned greater than 125% of the federal poverty guidelines in the
previous 12 months shall be excluded from this program. The estate of the
decedent shall include but not be limited to the ready availability of real or
personal property owned, employment benefits, pensions, annuities, social
security, unemployment compensation, inheritances, number and age of
dependents, outstanding debts, obligations and liabilities, and any other
relevant considerations concerning the financial condition of the decedent.
   (d)   The City shall pay a maximum of eight hundred dollars ($800) for the
cremation and inurnment of the remains of the indigent person. Said services
shall include necessary supplies and procedures and provide a temporary urn for
the storage of the deceased cremated remains. The cremated remains of the
deceased shall be released to the decedent’s family if the remains are claimed
by a family member within ten (10) days. If the remains are unclaimed, they
shall be permanently stored by the Funeral Home in an approved facility. The
City shall ensure that a death notice is published in the Dayton Daily News.
   (e)   The Funeral Home shall reduce the above cost to the City by the amount
of any funds received by the Funeral Home from the deceased’s family or any
other source. If additional funds are paid to the funeral home, and the City
has paid as herein provided, the funeral home shall refund to the City the
exact amount of additional funds paid to the funeral home within thirty days of
the receipt thereof by the Funeral Home.
   (f)   In the performance of services under this policy, the funeral home
shall comply with all statutes, ordinances, regulations, and rules of the
Federal Government, the State, the County and the City which are applicable.
City notices, approvals, authorizations, waivers, instructions, or any other
matters required to be executed by the City shall be effective only when given
in writing and signed by the City Manager or his authorized representative.
   (g)   During the performance of its duties and responsibilities of this
Policy, the Funeral Home agrees that in the hiring of employees for the
performance of work under this Policy, the Funeral Home shall not by reason of
race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, national origin or ancestry,
discriminate against any citizen in the employment of a person qualified and
available to perform work to which this agreement relates in violation of any

945.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this ordinance is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of Moraine through the regulation of non-storm
water discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable
as required by federal and state law. This ordinance establishes methods for
controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with requirements of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives
of this ordinance are:
   (a)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system (MS4) by storm water discharges by any user.
   (b)   To prohibit illicit Connections and Discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system.
   (c)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
      (Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
   (d)   To establish enforcement procedures to ensure compliance with this
chapter.
   The City’s OEPA NPDES permit (OHQ000004 or latest version) for authorization
to discharge storm water requires a Storm Water Management Plan (SWMP) that
satisfies the appropriate water quality requirements of ORC 6111 and the USEPA
Clean Water Act. The SWMP describes the best management practices (BMPs)
selected by the City to meet the requirements of the six minimum control
measures identified in the permit. Illicit discharge detection and elimination
is one of the minimum control measures. An Illicit Discharge Detection and
Elimination (IDDE) Plan is required as part of the permit. The IDDE Plan is the
City’s plan to detect and eliminate illicit discharges and connections to the
MS4. Requirements of the latest versions of the SWMP and IDDE Plan shall be
part of these regulations.

actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply
with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement
agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access

   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The City Manager and/or his/her designee shall be permitted to
enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as
often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification
and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the
necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the City Manager and/or his/her
designee ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The City Manager and/or his/her designee shall have the right to
set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of
the facility’s storm water discharge.
      (4)   The City Manager and/or his/her designee have the right to require
the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All
devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the

designee and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be
borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Manager and/or his/her
designee access to a permitted facility are a violation of a storm water
discharge permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a
facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the City Manager and/or his/her designee has been refused access
to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged and he/she is
able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction. (See Exhibits A-C appended hereto).
         (Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)

Best Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm
drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non- structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person’s expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water
pollution prevention plan as necessary for compliance with requirements of the
NPDES permit. (Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.12 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person’s lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.13 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the U.S. said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials
said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the
occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency
in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.
Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice
addressed and mailed to the City Manager within three business days of the
phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a
commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
establishment shall also retain an on-site record of the discharge and the
actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at
least three years.
(Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.14 ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever the City Manager and/or his/her designee finds that a person has

work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.15 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.

above. (Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.17 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.

City Manager objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten (10) days. If
the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision
of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an
appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and
shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any
person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable to
the City by reason of such violation.
(Ord. 1696-08. Passed 1-24-08.)
945.18 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter . If a person has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the authorized

administration of the provisions of this chapter including but not limited to
general construction and material specifications for streets and sewers and
standard drawings for street improvements and storm sewer appurtenances;
Administrative Rules and Procedures for the Review of Preliminary Plan and

(Ord. 304. Passed 4-14-70.)
1111.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, certain terms and conditions are defined as
follows:

      (1)    The division of any parcel of land shown as a unit or as
contiguous units on the last preceding tax roll, into two or more parcels,
sites or lots, any one of which is less than five acres for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of transfer of ownership, provided, however, that
the division or partition of land into parcels of more than five acres not
involving any new streets or easements of access, and the sale or exchange of
parcels between adjoining lot owners where such sale or exchange does not
create additional building sites, shall be exempted; or
      (2)    The improvement of one or more parcels of land for residential,
commercial or industrial structures or groups of structures involving the
division or allocation of land for the opening, widening or extension of any
street or streets, except private streets serving industrial structures; the

public sewer, water, storm drainage or other public facilities.
         (Ord. 304. Passed 4-14-70.)
1111.04 THOROUGHFARE PLAN STREETS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the official Thoroughfare Plan and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to
public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. Where not shown on the
official Thoroughfare Plan, the arrangement and other design standards of
streets shall conform to the provisions found herein. In no case shall an
official Thoroughfare Plan street be platted less than sixty feet in width.
(Ord. 304. Passed 4-14-70.)
1111.05 STANDARDS OF DESIGN.
   (a)    Relation to Adjoining Street System. The arrangement of streets in
new subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining areas or their proper projection where adjoining
and is not subdivided insofar as they are necessary for public requirements.
The width of streets in new subdivisions shall not be less than the minimum
widths established herein. The street and alley arrangement shall be such as
not to cause a hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their
own land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Residential streets
shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets shall
be avoided.
   (b)    Marginal Access Street. Whenever a subdivision has frontage upon a
major thoroughfare, the Planning Commission may require that the plat layout
make provision for a marginal access street parallel and adjacent to the
thoroughfare to provide access to the abutting lots. When provision is made for
a marginal access street, the subdivider is not required to provide
improvements on the adjacent thoroughfare.
   (c)    Angle of Intersection. The angle of intersection between minor
streets and major streets shall not vary more than ten degrees (10°) from a
right angle. All other streets shall intersect each other as near to a right
angle as possible and no intersection of streets at angles of less than sixty
degrees (60°) be permitted.
   (d)    Rounding of Property Corners.
      (1)    At all street intersections the corner of property lines shall be
rounded by a radius of not less than fifteen feet.

place of a circular arc. Where two alleys intersect, an eight foot cut-off
shall be provided.
(e)    Private Streets and Reserve Strips.

stipulation that no on- street parking is allowed.
**    Short cul-de-sac or loop streets may also be approved with fifty-foot
right of way after proper analysis by the Planning Commission.
 
This utility easement is not considered as being additional to the right-of-way
width. These easements will usually be required when utility lines are along
the sides or the rear of lots.
      (1)    Additional street right-of-way width may be required to assure
adequate access, circulation and parking in subdivisions within high density
residential areas, commercial areas and industrial areas.

platted if deemed necessary.
      (5)    Alleys: Alleys shall not be permitted in residential districts.
Alleys are required in the rear of all commercial and industrial lots if no
other provisions are made for adequate service access or for parking. Dead-end
alleys shall not be permitted.
      (6)    Street names and house numbers: Names of new streets shall not
duplicate existing or platted street names unless a new street is a
continuation of, or in alignment with an existing or platted street.
      (7)    House numbers shall be assigned in accordance with the house
numbering system in effect in the City and in the County.
   (g)    Easements. Easements of at least seven and one-half feet in width
shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines,
where necessary, for public utilities, such as gas, electric, telephone, storm
and sanitary sewers, water or other mains or for surface drainage swales.
Easements of greater width may be required along or across lots where necessary
for the extension of main sewers or other utilities or where both water and
sewer lines are located in the same easement. A two-foot easement shall be
required on both sides of an alley to accommodate pole lines.
   (h)    Blocks. No block shall be longer than 1,500 feet or shorter than 300
feet in length, except where unusual topographic conditions or other physical
features warrant a greater or shorter length. Where a subdivision adjoins a
major thoroughfare, the long dimension of the block shall front along such
major thoroughfare to avoid unnecessary ingress or egress.
   (i)    Crosswalks. A dedicated crosswalk or easement not less than ten feet
in width may be required to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds,
shopping centers and other facilities.
 
   (j)    Lots. Lots in subdivisions shall meet the following standards:
      (1)    Arrangement. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all
lots will provide building sites properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development and having frontage upon a public street
or road.
      (2)    Lot lines. All side lot lines of lots shall be at right angles to
straight street lines and radial to curved street lines except where a
variation to this rule will provide a better street and lot layout.
      (3)    Double frontage. Lots with double frontage shall not be approved
except to avoid frontage upon heavily traveled thoroughfares or to adjust to
other unusual circumstances.
      (4)    Lot sizes.
         A.    City of Moraine. No lot in the City of Moraine shall have a
width of less than sixty feet at the building line except the following:
            1.    The minimum width for a lot in a mobile home subdivision
shall be forty-five feet.
         B.    Three-mile Area Single or Two-family Development. Pursuant to
provisions of Ohio R.C. 711.10, lots in the three-mile jurisdictional area of
the City of Moraine which are to be used for single or two- family residences
shall conform in area and width to the requirements of Subdivision Regulations
for Montgomery County, Ohio, adopted by the Board of County Commissioners by
Resolution 663 on May 19, 1955, or subsequent amendments thereto.
         C.    Three-mile Area Multi-family Development. Pursuant to provisions
of Ohio R.C. 711.10, lots in the three-mile jurisdictional area of the City of
Moraine designed for multiple-family development, shall conform in area and
width to the requirements of Subdivision Regulations for Montgomery County,
Ohio, adopted by the Board of County Commissioners by Resolution 663 on May 19,
1955, or subsequent amendments thereto.

         G.    Unusual Conditions. In a case of unusual soil conditions or
other physical factors which may impair the health and safety of the
neighborhood in which a subdivision is located, the Planning Commission may
require larger lot widths and lot areas as may be necessary.
         H.    Zoning. Where compliance with existing zoning regulations will
result in a requirement for a greater lot area or width than the standards set
forth herein, the more restrictive requirements shall take precedence.
         I.    Corner Lots. Corner lots shall be of sufficient width to permit
an adequate building setback line for each street upon which the lot abuts.
         J.    Building Lines. Where the subdivided area is to be used for
residential purposes, the subdivider shall establish building lines in
accordance with the character of the development, but in no case shall the
front building line be less than that established by the zoning or less than
twenty-five feet from the right of way of the street or thoroughfare.
Restrictions requiring buildings to be set back of such building lines shall be
shown on the plat.
         K.    Public Sites and Open Spaces. Where a site for a proposed park,
playground, school or other public use which is shown upon the Comprehensive
Plan for the City or County is located in whole or in part in a subdivision,
the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to grant the appropriate
public agency an opportunity to acquire such areas within the subdivision.
         L.    Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important
surface drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, and open
drainage is to be permitted, the subdivider shall provide an adequate easement
along each side of the stream or open drainage course for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream or open
drainage course for drainage or recreational use.
         M.    Land Subject to Flooding. The right is reserved to disapprove
any subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding or which contains
extremely poor drainage facilities. However, if the subdivider agrees to make
such improvements as will make the area safe for residential occupancy, the
subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval of the County
Board of Health.
            (Ord. 304. Passed 4-14-70.)
 
1111.06 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED.
    (a)    Completion or Assurance. No final plat of any subdivision shall be
approved unless:
      (1)    The improvements listed in the following subsections have been
completed; or
      (2)    The subdivider has filed with the City Engineer a surety bond,
cashier's check or certified check guaranteeing to the City that such

discretionary techniques have been subject to challenge; they may permit a
community to deny certain applications and conceal the real reasons.
Exclusionary zoning, in all its subtle variations, is considered by many the
most effective and persuasive tool used by suburbs to maintain their homogenous
character. A growing number of State court decisions are invalidating
exclusionary practices, whether intentional or unintentional, and in some cases
are requiring affirmative, inclusionary practices. On the other hand,
discretionary techniques, such as inclusionary zoning, can be an important part

find that they can skip this expensive land and buy up other land, usually
farms, at some distance, sometimes several miles out. While the houses may be
cheaper, the result may be serious problems for both the new residents and the
public. Not only may there be inadequate access to transportation and
utilities, but other public services, shopping and other support services may
be lacking, and they may cost much more to provide. Urban limit lines, acreage
zoning and a variety of other growth management techniques may be imposed to
prevent such development.

most distant from the front lot line of the lot; in the case of an irregular,
triangular or gore shaped lot, a line twenty (20) feet in length, entirely
within the lot, parallel to and at the maximum possible distance from, the
front line shall be considered to be the rear lot line. In the case of lots
which have frontage on more than one (1) street, the rear lot line shall be
opposite the lot line along which the lot takes access to a street. See Figure
I.
         C.    "Side lot line" means a lot line which is neither a front lot

      (218.1)   “Marijuana “ means marijuana as defined in Ohio Revised Code
Section 3719.01.
      (218.2)   “Medical Marijuana” means marijuana that is cultivated,

specified development activities. Moratoriums on the issuance of building
permits or on sewer hookups, for example, may be imposed to allow the community
to build the necessary utilities to accommodate the new development. Interim
zoning can be considered a form of moratorium which gives time for the Zoning
Code to be changed (or a new one prepared) to allow for changing conditions and
needs. Moratoriums are increasingly common and are generally considered to be
legal when not abused.
      (225)    "Municipality" means the City of Moraine, Ohio.
      (226)    "National Flood Insurance Program" means a Federal program which
authorizes the sale of Federally subsidized flood insurance in communities
where such flood insurance is not available privately.
      (227)    "National Historic Preservation Act" means a 1966 Federal law

on Historic Preservation and authorizing grants in aid for historic properties
preservation.
      (228)    "National Register of Historic Places" means the official list,
established by the National Historic Preservation Act, of sites, districts,
buildings, structures and objects significant in the nation's history or whose
artistic or architectural value is unique.
      (229)    "Nonconforming lot" means a lot, the area, dimensions or
location of which was lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of
this Zoning Code, but which fails by reasons of such adoption, revision or
amendment to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district.
      (230)    "Nonconforming sign" means any sign lawfully existing on the
effective date of an ordinance, or an amendment thereto, which renders such
sign nonconforming because it does not conform to all the standards and
regulations of the adopted or amended ordinance.
      (231)    "Nonconforming structure or building" means a structure or
building the size, dimensions or location of which was lawful prior to the
adoption, revision or amendment to this Zoning Code, but which fails by reason
of such adoption, revision or amendment, to conform to the present requirements
of the zoning district.
      (232)    "Nonconforming use" means a use or activity which was lawful
prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of a Zoning Code, but which fails,
by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, to conform to the present
requirements of the zoning district.
      (233)    "Nuisance" means anything that interferes with the use or
enjoyment of property, endangers personal health or safety, or is offensive to
the senses. There are many types of nuisances, and the law can be invoked to
determine when, in fact, a nuisance exists and should be abated. Nuisance law
forms part of the basis for zoning. The separation of uses through zoning, for
example, industrial from residential, helps to foster the enjoyment of
residential areas free from pollution, noise, congestion and the other
characteristics of industrial areas. Performance standards, which are better
able to measure degree of nuisance, have been developed as a way of dealing
with activities by the way they perform, rather than as classes.
      (234)    "Nursery" means a form of agriculture whose chief function is
the growing of plants, shrubs and trees.
      (235)    "Nursing home, rest home or convalescent home" means a place,

persons such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc.; or general business office
such as insurance companies, trade associations, manufacturing companies,
investment concerns, banks and trust companies, real estate companies, etc.,
but not including any kind of retail or wholesale store or warehouse, except as
otherwise provided herein.
      (239)    "Opaque" means completely screened from view through the use of
a man- made screen and/or natural landscaping which serves to visually shield
or obscure an abutting or nearby area from another.
      (240)    "Open space" means any parcel or area of land or water
essentially unimproved and set aside, dedicated, designated or reserved for
public or private use or enjoyment, or for the use and enjoyment of owners and
occupants of land adjoining or neighboring such open space.
      (241)    "Common open space" means land within or related to a
development, not individually owned or dedicated for public use, which is

      (245)    "Outbuilding" means a separate accessory building or structure
not physically connected to the principal building.
         (Ord. 995-92. Passed 1-14-93.)
      (245.1)   "Outdoor Entertainment" means any event conducted in other than
an enclosed building and which includes one or more of the following
activities: (a) outdoor live performances, musical or otherwise; (b) outdoor
presentations of video or filmed material on shown on a temporary screen,
except drive-in theaters; (c) motorized races of trucks, motorcycles, boats,
and the like; or (d) non-motorized races involving horses or other animals.
         (Ord. 1808-11. Passed 8-25-11.)
      (246)    "Overhang" means:
         A.    The part of a roof or wall which extends beyond the facade of a
lower wall;

the provisions of this Zoning Code and of rules and regulations adopted
pursuant thereto, to the same extent as if he were the owner.

of such lots and/or tracts shown on the assessor's roll of Montgomery County,
or contiguous area of land under legal control of any one (1) person,
partnership, firm, corporation, syndicate, agency or institution. See also
"lot" in subsection (a)(201) hereof; and "tract" in subsection (a)(421) hereof.
      (249)    "Off-street parking space" means an area of definite length and
width; such area shall be exclusive of drives, aisles or entrances giving
access thereto and shall be fully accessible for the storage or parking of
permitted vehicles. Such area shall be located totally outside of any street or
alley right of way.
      (250)    "Public parking space" means an off-street parking area publicly
or privately owned available for public use whether free, for compensation or
as an accommodation for clients or customers.
      (251)    "Paved surface" means a hard, smooth surface made principally of
asphaltic concrete, Portland cement or brick that will bear travel.
      (252)   "Peak business cycle" means the periodic maximum activity level
of a business resulting in the highest inventory levels of regulated

      (253)   "Performance bond" or "surety bond" means an agreement by a
subdivider or developer with the City of Moraine for the amount of the
estimated construction cost guaranteeing the completion of physical
improvements according to plans and specifications within the time prescribed
by the subdivider's agreements.
      (254)   "Performance standards" means a minimum requirement or maximum
allowable limit on the effects or characteristics of a use, usually written in
the form of regulatory language. A building code, for example, might specify a
performance standard referring to the fire resistance of a wall, rather than
specifying its construction materials. Performance standards in zoning might
describe allowable uses with respect to smoke, odor, noise, heat, vibration,
glare, traffic generation, visual impact and so on, instead of the more
traditional classifications of "light" or "heavy" lists of uses. It is a more
precise way of defining compatibility and at the same time is intended to
expand developer's options. The performance standards have been in the area of
industrial emissions. (Local requirements in many fields, especially pollution
control, have now been superseded by Federal or State regulations.) Because
such measures require technical skill and often some expensive equipment, small
communities have tended to prefer the more traditional specification standard
approach. In such places, clear statements of purpose or intent often are
substituted for precise measurable standards.
      (255)   "Perimeter" means the boundaries or borders of a lot, tract or
parcel of land.
      (256)   "Permit" means written governmental permission issued by an
authorized official, empowering the holder thereof to do an act not forbidden
by law, but not allowed without such authorization.
         (Ord. 995-92. Passed 1-14-93.)
      (257)   "Permitted use" means a use by right which is specifically
authorized in a particular zoning district. It is contrasted with special uses
which are authorized only if certain requirements are met and after review and
approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (Ord. 1019-93. Passed 5-27-93.)
      (258)   "Person" means a corporation, company, association, society,
firm, partnership or joint stock company, as well as an individual, a state,
and all political subdivisions of a state or any agency or instrumentality
thereof.
      (259)    "Personal services" means a use providing services of a personal
convenience nature, cleaning, repair, or sales incidental thereto, and
including art, dance or music studios, beauty and barber shops, shoe repair,
self-service laundry and cleaning service, laundry and cleaning service,
laundry and cleaning pick-up stations (where bulk cleaning and servicing is
done elsewhere), repair and fitting of clothes and personal accessories,
copying and similar services.
      (260)    "Planning" means the decision-making process in which goals and
objectives are established, existing resources and conditions analyzed,
strategies developed, and controls enacted to achieve the goals and objectives
to which they relate.
      (261)    "Planned Unit Development (PUD)" means:
         A.    Land under unified control, planned and developed as a whole;
and
         B.    In a single development operation or a definitely programmed
series of development operations including all lands and buildings; and
         C.    According to comprehensive and detailed plans which include only
streets, utilities, lots or building sites and the like, but also site plans
and design principles for all buildings as intended to be located, constructed,
used and related to each other; and detailed plans for other uses and
improvements on the land as related to buildings; and
         D.    With a program of provision, operation and maintenance of such
areas, improvements and facilities necessary for common use by some or all of
the occupants of the development, but which will not be provided, operated or
maintained at general public expense.
While a PUD has most commonly been used for housing development, it also is
frequently applied to other forms of development such as shopping centers,
industrial and office parks, and to mixed-use developments. Planned unit
development allows the unified, and hence potentially more desirable and
attractive development of an area, based on a comprehensive site plan. PUD can
have a number of advantages over conventional lot-by- lot development
including: mixing building types and uses to create more heterogeneous and
"alive" communities; combining often unusable yard space on individual lots
into larger common open spaces; offering greater opportunities for incentives
to building lower cost housing; lower street and utility costs resulting from
reduced frontage; and the possibility of increasing the density of a
development while keeping desired amenities.
      (262)    "Planning Commission" means the Planning Commission of the City
of Moraine, Ohio.
      (263)    "Plat" means a map, generally, or a subdivision, showing the
location, boundaries and ownership of individual properties. A plat may simply
be the device for officially recording ownership changes or lot division; in
communities which have subdivision regulations, submission and approval of a
plat is a prerequisite to building. Approval of a preliminary plat, usually by
the Planning Commission, involves a determination that the subdivision conforms
to the regulations and to the lot-size requirements of the Zoning Code. To plat
means to subdivide; where subdivision regulations are in effect this in turn
may mean to obtain the necessary approvals without necessarily intending to
improve or build, or, where they are not, to record. Property is frequently
platted as a speculative venture; platted, but undeveloped property, may
require public purchase or other action to bring it up to current regulatory
standards.
      (263.1)"Plot" means:
         A.    A single unit parcel of land; or
         B.    A parcel that can be identified and referenced to a recorded
plat or map.
      (264)    "Police power" means the authority of government to exercise
controls to protect the public's health, safety, morals and general welfare. As
distinct from eminent domain powers, in which government takes property, no
compensation need be paid for the imposition of police power controls. The
degree to which such exercise becomes, in effect, a taking of property, is a
question of long standing and has arisen again lately in connection with the
restrictive growth management controls being imposed by some communities.
      (265)    "Policy plan" means a plan adopted by Council to serve as a
guide for public decision-making in regards to future development by
establishing goals, objectives and policies for the City.
      (266)    "Preapplication conference" means the discussion held between
developers and public officials, usually members of the Planning Commission
before formal submission of an application for a permit or for subdivision plat
approval. This meeting allows the staff to:
         A.    Acquaint the applicant with the comprehensive area or precise
plans that apply to this tract, as well as the zoning and other codes that
affect the proposed development;
         B.    Suggest improvements to the proposed design on the basis of a
review of the sketch plan;
         C.    Advise the applicant on ways to reduce unnecessary costs and
encourage the applicant to get financial advice early;
         D.    Encourage the applicant to consult appropriate authorities on
the character and placement of public utility services;
         E.    Help the applicant to understand the steps to be taken to
receive approval; and
         F.    Give the applicant a reading on the likelihood of acceptance of
these plans based on appropriate laws and ordinances.
      (267)    "Potable water" means water suitable for drinking and cooking
purposes.
      (268)    "Preliminary approval" means the conferral of certain rights,
prior to final approval, after specific elements of a development or site plan
have been approved by the proper reviewing authority and agreed to by the
applicant.
      (269)    "Premises" means a lot, parcel, tract or plot of land together
with the buildings and structures therein.
      (270)   "Principal use" means the primary predominant use of any lot.
      (271)   "Private educational facility" means a privately owned school,
including schools owned and operated by religious organizations, offering
instruction in the several branches of learning and study required to be taught
in the public schools by the State of Ohio.
      (272)    "Private club". See subsection (a)(61) hereof.
      (273)    "Private street" means a street that is not dedicated to the
City.
      (274)    "Protected public water supply" means a public water system
which serves at least fifteen (15) service connections used by year round
residents or regularly serves at least twenty-five (25) year round residents,
and having a one (1) year capture area defined through appropriate hydrologic
studies.
      (275)    "Public hearing" means a meeting announced and advertised in
advance and open to the public, with the public given an opportunity to talk
and participate.
      (276)    "Public improvement" means any improvement, facility or service
together with its associated public site or right of way necessary to provide
transportation, drainage, public or private utilities, energy or similar
essential services.
      (277)    "Public notice" means the advertisement of a public hearing in a
paper of general circulation in the area, and through other media sources,
indicating the time, place and nature of the public hearing.
      (278)    "Public sewer and water system" means any system other than an
individual septic tank, tile field or individual well, that is operated by a

with an exclusive franchise for providing a public service.
      (280)    "Public utility facility" means telephone, electric and cable
television lines, poles, equipment and structures; water or gas pipes, mains,
valves or structures, sewer pipes, valves or structures; pumping stations;
telephone exchanges and repeater stations; and all other facilities, equipment
and structures necessary for conducting a service by a government or a public
utility.
      (281)    "Public water supply" shall include but not be limited to county
and municipal water supplies, their successors and assigns.
      (282)    "Public way" means an alley, avenue, boulevard, bridge, channel,
ditch, easement, expressway, freeway, highway, land, parkway, right of way,
road, sidewalk, street, tunnel, viaduct, walk, bicycle path; or other ways on

built. See also "parcel" in subsection (a)(248) hereof, "plot" in subsection
(a)(263.1) hereof and "site plan" in subsection (a)(384) hereof.
      (384)    "Site plan" means the development plan for one (1) or more lots
on which is shown the existing and proposed conditions of the lot including;
topography, vegetation drainage, floodplains, marshes and waterways; open
spaces, walkways, means of ingress and egress, utility services, landscaping,
structures and signs, lighting and screening devices; any other information
that reasonably may be required in order that an informed decision can be made
by the approving authority.
      (385)    "Sketch (concept; outline) plan or plat" means a generalized map
that is prepared by a developer, usually before the preapplication conference,
to let the developer/subdivider save time and expense in reaching agreement
with the Planning Commission as to the form of the plan and the purposes of the
regulation. Its purpose is simply to serve as a basis for discussion without
either side making commitments.
      (386)    "Soil erosion and sediment" means a plan that indicates
necessary land treatment measures, including a schedule for installation, which
shall effectively minimize soil erosion and sedimentation.
      (387)    "Special District" means a particular zoning designation and
related provisions applied to certain areas of the City which are characterized
by unique physical attributes and/or circumstances. Two (2) examples of such
districts are Floodplain designation and Historic Districts.
      (388)    "Special use". See subsection (a)(441) hereof.
      (389)    "Spot zoning" means zoning a relatively small area differently
from the zoning of the surrounding area, usually for an incompatible use and to
favor the owner of a particular piece or pieces of property. "Spot zoning" is
invalidated by the courts when it violates "in accordance with a Comprehensive
Plan" requirements of State enabling legislation. The "spotness" is in the
arbitrary and inappropriate nature of the change rather than, as is commonly
believed, in the size of the area.
         "Spot zoning" often is a reason why many flexible techniques such as
floating zones or conditional rezoning have been prohibited, the argument being
that conferring narrow development permission is a form of "spot zoning".
Special small-area zoning districts, however, have been upheld where the
comprehensive plan demonstrates a special need, such as for an historic area or
to preserve a sensitive natural area. "Spot zoning", in sum, can be legal or
illegal, but laymen generally think that it always is illegal and use the term
loosely, and disparaging at public hearings when they oppose the change.
      (390)    "Stable" means a structure that is used for the shelter or
maintenance of horses and cattle.
      (391)    "Standards", while often used loosely to refer to all
requirements in a Zoning Code, usually means site design regulations such as
lot area, height limits, frontage, landscaping, yards and floor area ratio, as
distinguished from use restrictions.
      (392)    "Statement of intent (statement of purpose)" means a statement
of policy or objectives, often incorporated in a Zoning Code, which outlines
the broad purpose of the Zoning Code and its relationship to the comprehensive
plan; frequently, a statement preceding regulations for individual districts,
which helps to characterize the districts, and their legislative purpose. When
the application of particular district requirements is challenged in court, the
courts rely on the intent statement in deciding whether the application is
reasonable and related to a defensible public purpose. As Zoning Codes become
more complex, with numerous special districts and flexible applications,
statements of intent, which guide users, administrative officials, and the
courts, are making more frequent appearances.
      (393)    "Steep slopes" means land area where the inclination of the
land's surface from the horizontal is twelve percent (12%) or greater. Slope is
determined from on-site topographic surveys prepared with a two (2) foot
contour interval.
      (394)    "Strip zoning" means a zone normally consisting of a ribbon of
uses fronting both sides of an arterial roadway and extending inward for half a
block. Strip commercial development is the most common form and occurs
naturally everywhere. In suburban areas or along well-traveled roads, is
usually characterized by an assortment of gas stations, drive-in and fast food
restaurants, motels, tourist shops, and some automobile sales and service
operations. In fringe areas, such uses may be interspersed with a few farms and
farm service outlets like feed distributors and large equipment sales;
unlimited highway access to such uses severely reduces road carrying capacity.
And in other cities, strips of convenience stores and other retail stores are
found scattered within residential neighborhoods.
          "Strip zoning" is a recognition that since such development will not
go away, its most irksome characteristics should be controlled. These include
access, use limitations, parking, signs, some development standards, and
occasionally, though seldom successfully, clustering requirements and aesthetic
controls.
      (395)    "Story" means that part of a building, except a mezzanine,
included between the surface of one (1) floor and the surface of the next
floor, or if there is not a floor above, then the ceiling next above. A story
thus defined shall not be counted as a story when more than fifty percent
(50%), by cubic content, is below the height level of the adjoining ground.
      (396)    "Half story" means an uppermost story lying under a sloping
roof, the usable floor area of which, at a height of four (4) feet above the
floor does not exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the floor area in the story directly
below, and the height above at least 200 square feet of floor space is seven
(7) feet, six (6) inches.

(419) hereof.
      (398)    "Structural alteration" means any change in the supporting

the division or partition of land into parcels of more than five (5) acres not
involving any new streets or easements of access and the sale or exchange of
parcels between adjoining lot owners, where such sale or exchange does not
create additional building sites, shall be exempted; or
         B.    The improvement of one (1) or more parcels of land for
residential, commercial or industrial structures or groups or structures
involving the division or allocation of land for the opening, widening or

      (449)    "Vested right" means a right that has become absolute and fixed
and cannot be defeated or denied by subsequent conditions or change in

existing zoning classification or to have zoning remain the same forever.
However, once development has been started or has been completed, there is a
right to maintain that particular use regardless of the classification given
the property. In order for a nonconforming use to earn the right to continue
when the zoning is changed, the right shall have been vested before the change.
If the right to complete the development has not been vested, it may not be
built, no nonconforming use shall be established, and the new regulations shall
have to be complied with.
         Vested rights are often established by showing that some development
permit has been obtained and substantial construction on the project started.
How much construction or land improvements shall have been completed before the
rights are vested varies among the states. In some states application for a
building permit or other development approval may be sufficient to establish a
"vested right" to complete a project. Others may require substantial investment
and beginning of construction on the land, with completion of structures that
are unique to the planned project.

      (468)    "Zone of influence" means a zone delineated by iso-travel time
contours around wellfields. The zone is calculated, based on the rate of
movement of groundwaters in the vicinity of wells with an allowance for the
dispersion of a pollutant entering into and moving with the groundwater.
      (469)    "Zoning" means a police power measure, enacted primarily by
general purpose units of local government, in which the community is divided
into districts or zones within which permitted and special uses are established
as are regulations governing lot size, building bulk, placement and other
development standards. Requirements vary from district to district, but they
shall be uniform within districts. The Zoning Code consists of two (2) parts; a
definition of zoning still applies, but recent innovations in flexible zoning,
for example, floating zones and expansion of special use permit controls, have
begun to blur some of the Zoning Code's neatness and clarity.
      (470)    "Zoning Administrator" means employee(s) of the City of Moraine,

uniform.
      (475)    "Zoning envelope" means the three (3) dimensional space within
which a structure is permitted to be built on a lot and which is defined by
maximum height regulations, yard setbacks and sky exposure plane regulations.

districts which, along with the zoning text, comprises the Zoning Code.
      (477)    "Zoning permit" means a document signed by the Zoning Inspector,

complies with the provisions of the Zoning Code or authorized variance
therefrom.
      (478)    "Zero lot line" means a development approach in which a building
is sited on one (1) or more lot lines with no yard. Conceivably, three (3) of
the four (4) sides of the building could be on the lot lines. The intent is to
allow more flexibility in site design and to increase the amount of usable open
space on the lot. Virtually all zoning developments have been permitted, they
have been handled through variances or planned unit development procedures, or
other devices which allow for site plan review. The few ordinances which
specifically authorize the zero lot line approach do so as an exception to
prevailing regulations and under clearly defined circumstances. (Ord. 995-92.

conditions, guarantees and safeguards as it deems necessary for the general
welfare, for the protection of individual property rights and for ensuring that
the intent and objectives of this Zoning Code shall be observed.

the Well Field Protection Overlay District is deemed by the Zoning Officer to
pose a real and present danger of contaminating surface and/or ground water
which would normally enter the public water supply, the Zoning Officer is
authorized to use the nuisance abatement and control authority granted by Ohio
R.C. 715.44 to:
         A.    Cause cessation of such activity or use of the regulated
substance;
         B.    Require the provision of administrative controls and/or
facilities sufficient to mitigate such danger; and/or
         C.    Cause the provision of pollution control and/or abatement
activities.
      (2)    Considerations. When considering the exercise of any of the above
authorities or actions, the Zoning Officer shall first consult with the City
Manager and with the appropriate administrative official of any potentially
affected protected public water supply. Such consultation shall determine what
measures need to be taken to ensure the public water supply is reasonably and
adequately protected from contamination for the present and future. The Zoning
Officer may take into consideration any evidence represented by the entity
regarding cost effectiveness and the economic effectiveness and the economic
impact imposed by the requirements or actions.
      (3)    Exemption of certain regulated substances. The Zoning Officer is
authorized to exclude certain regulated substances that pose no threat to
groundwater from the provisions of this section. Prior to authorizing the
exemption of any regulated substance, the Zoning Officer shall have such
request for exemption reviewed by a designated review board as selected by
Council. The recommendation of the board shall be binding on the Zoning
Officer.
      (4)    Technical consultants. Upon application for a Zoning Certificate
and/or Occupancy Permit for a use within the WP Well Field Protection Overlay
District, the Zoning Officer may employ such technical expertise as needed to
ensure compliance with the provisions of this section. All costs incurred in
the compliance review process shall be passed through to the applicant and
shall be in addition to those fees normally charged by the City to review a
zoning certificate and/or occupancy permit.
   (e)    Well Field Protection Appeals Board.
      (1)    Appeals. Any person may appeal an action of the Zoning Officer in
subsection (d) hereof, by filing with the Council Clerk a notice of appeal
within twenty (20) days of such action. Failure to do so shall be deemed a
waiver of the right to appeal. The notice of appeal shall include all
information contained on such notice of appeal and not limited to name;
address; telephone number; date; and a statement of intent to appeal. In
addition a description of the nature of the appeal, and any pertinent
documentation shall be filed with such appeal.
      (2)    Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals of the City is hereby
appointed to hear Well Field Protection Appeals. The Board is authorized to
consult with and obtain technical assistance, when in the Board's sole
discretion, it deems assistance to be necessary, from technical experts. The
decision of the Board shall constitute a final administrative order that may be
appealed by the City or by any aggrieved party to the Court of Common Pleas of
Montgomery County as provided by law.
(Ord. 1025-93. Passed 6-10-93.)
1123.99 PENALTY.

developed multi-family areas as well as areas which could serve a transitional
function between single family neighborhoods and commercial areas. Certain
areas located in proximity to larger open space areas would be suitable for
this zoning classification as well. (Ord. 1203-97. Passed 7-10-97.)

1155.14   M-PUD Industrial Planned Unit Development District.
 
 
1155.01 INTENT.
   The purpose of the planned unit development ("PUD") district provisions is
to provide a means of development that is flexible and innovative when
development of a site by standard, more rigid, conventional zoning district
regulations may produce less efficient use of the land and less amenities and
benefits for the community and users of the development. Development under
planned unit development provisions provides a means for encouraging ingenuity,
imagination and flexibility on the part of landowners, engineers, architects,
site planners and developers in the planning and design of land areas. It is
not the intent of the planned unit development provisions to allow applicants
to circumvent the intent of this Zoning Code or to allow development of land
not in conformance with the Land Use Plan of the City.
(Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.02 PUD APPLICABILITY.
   The use of the Planned Unit Development procedures contained in this Chapter
are not mandatory for the development of any parcel of land. The intent and
purpose of this process is to administratively encourage an alternative
procedure, which maximizes the utilization of land primarily for the benefit,
use and enjoyment of the businesses and residents of that area, as well as the
existing community.
   Proposals for development shall be developed under PUD district provisions
when the Director determines the development proposal exhibits one or more of
the following listed characteristics or a characteristic of similar magnitude
or nature.
   (a)   The total gross area of the proposed development is ten acres or more
in size, except;
      (1)   Detached single-family developments of less than 100 lots submitted
for development under R-2 or R-2A and R3 zoning district requirements;
      (2)   Multi-family developments submitted under R-4 zoning district
requirements;
      (3)   Developments proposed for A-1 zoned property and all of the uses
proposed for the development are permitted by A-1 zoning; or
      (4)   Expansions of existing Business and Industrial developments with
the appropriate zoning designation.
   (b)   The proposed development involves uses permitted by standard zoning
districts in accordance with the provisions of Chapters
1135 through
1177 of this code, and such uses are permitted by one or more PUD Districts,
and without PUD District Zoning classification the development would normally
require the approval of more than one standard zoning district.
      (Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.03 TYPES OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   Types of planned unit development districts include R-PUD (Residential
Planned Unit Development), B-PUD (Business Planned Unit Development), MX-PUD
(Mixed Use Planned Unit Development), and M-PUD (Industrial Planned Unit
Development). Each PUD District shall be governed by the requirements specified
for each respective PUD District and the general provisions governing Planned
Unit Developments.
(Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Definitions and Interpretation. For the purposes of this chapter,
certain terms or words used herein shall be interpreted or defined as follows:
  
   ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION. Either the first placement or permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab footings or
the installation of piles. The following shall not be construed as or be
interpreted as constituting the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION: land preparation,
such as clearing, grading and filling; the excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, foundations or the erection of temporary forms.
  
   COMMUNITY. The physical environs and area located either totally or
partially within the boundaries of the City.
   DIRECTOR. For the purposes of this document, the Planning Director shall be
the City Planner or the City Manager’s Designee.
  
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. All surfaces that do not absorb water, including but not
limited to roads, sidewalks, parking areas, roofs, and any area paved in
concrete, asphalt, or solid pavers.
  
   INSTITUTIONAL USES. Colleges, universities, schools with any of first
through twelfth grades, seminaries, churches, places of worship, public or
governmental libraries, hospitals and medical centers, museums, governmental or
public offices and buildings, community centers, indoor recreation centers,
cemeteries, or uses of similar character.
  
   MAIN BUILDING or MAIN STRUCTURE. A building in which is conducted the main
use of the lot where the building is situated and includes areas such as
garages, carports, and storage areas that are attached to such building or
structure. Such term shall not include buildings or structures in which
accessory uses are conducted.
  
   MAIN USE. The principal use or uses to which the premises are devoted and
the principal purpose or purposes for which the premises exist.
  
   OPEN SPACE. Any area or areas within a development not covered by
structures, parking lots, asphalt and/or concrete pavement. As determined by
the Planning Commission, walkways and certain structures that are an integral
part of a landscaping and beautification plan for development may be counted as
open space.
   PUD. The Planned Unit Development.
  
   PUD AGREEMENT. An agreement, entered into between the city and the
developer, intended to assure the completion of certain improvements, either
not usually included in a subdivider's agreement and performance bond or in the
absence of a subdivider's agreement and performance bond, which may not
otherwise be completed in a timely and satisfactory manner. Such improvements
may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, roadway improvements, and
detention facilities.
  
   SPECIFIC SITE PLAN. A detailed development plan for a part of, or all of, a
planned unit development indicating the specific proposed locations of
structures and signs, parking areas, means of vehicular access and movement,
pedestrian walkways, landscaping and open space, lighting plans, buffering and
screening devices, utility services, drainage and runoff control systems, and
other details as required by this chapter.
  
   SLOPE. The relationship between the change in elevation of land (rise) and
the horizontal distance over which that change in elevation occurs (run). Slope
shall be calculated by dividing the rise by the run, multiplied by 100, and
expressed as a percentage.
  
   SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS. The Planning Commission or City Council may
require conditions that modify or alter proposed PUD zoning classification
application or specific site plan applications.
  
   (b)   Project Control and Ownership. Planned unit development district
designation is intended to apply to development sites that are under single
ownership or unified control. The project land may be owned, leased, or
controlled by either one or more persons, partnerships, corporations or other
appropriate business associations capable of satisfying the objectives and
requirements of the planned unit development district. The city may require
proof of ownership, covenants, easements, and other forms of property rights or
control to ensure satisfactory compliance with PUD objectives and requirements.
  
   (c)   PUD Agreement. Upon approval of a specific site plan, the city, at its
sole discretion, may require the PUD developer to enter into a PUD agreement
with the city, and to furnish a performance bond for the purposes of assuring
completion of all requirements for improvements such as landscaping and
drainage control facilities and any conditions and safeguards as may be set by
the City Council and the adopted ordinance approving the specific PUD
development. At its discretion, the city may accept a letter of credit or other
form of performance guarantee and security in lieu of a performance bond. In
all cases the sufficiency and adequacy of such bond, letter of credit or other
form of guarantee or security shall be at the sole determination of the city.
   (d)   Utility Requirements. All initial and all future expanded utility
systems within the limits of all planned unit development districts are
required to be placed underground. Utility systems subject to this requirement
shall be those that primarily serve the development within the PUD district and
shall include, but not be limited to telephone, cable television, and
electrical systems. Appurtenances of these systems which can be effectively
screened may be excluded from this requirement if the Planning Staff determines
that such appurtenances are essential for utility service to other areas of the
community and that such exclusion will not violate the intent or character of
the proposed planned unit development or any conditions, restrictions or other
requirements imposed upon the development.
  
   (e)   Application Process and Sequence. Due to the flexible and special
character of planned unit development districts and projects, and to assist
reviewing authorities in evaluating the merits and making findings of proposed
PUD projects, the full PUD approval process generally involves either a two
stage review or a single stage/concurrent review. The applicant may select
either the two-stage review process or the single stage/concurrent review
process. Unless the applicant informs the Planning Director at the time of
submission of the PUD zoning classification application of selection of the
single stage/concurrent review process, the applicant shall be considered to
have selected the two stage review process.
      (1)   Two-stage review process.
         A.   First stage. The first stage of the two-stage PUD review process
shall consists of submission of an application for PUD zoning classification in
accordance with division (f) of this section and Section
1155.05(a) - (c). The Planning Commission shall review and make a
recommendation on the PUD zoning classification application in accordance with
Section
1155.05 (d) - (f). The City Council then, in accordance with Section
1155.05(g) and (h), reviews the PUD zoning classification application and makes
a decision to either approve as submitted, approve with supplementary
conditions or disapprove the application. Approval of PUD zoning classification
constitutes only approval of PUD district zoning for the subject property. A
specific site plan shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of a
City zoning permit for the subject property.
         B.   Second stage. Unless the applicant selects the single stage/
concurrent review process as per division (f)(2) of this section, the second
stage of the two-stage PUD approval process begins at the initiation of the
applicant and only if the PUD zoning classification application submitted in
the first stage was approved or approved with supplementary conditions by City
Council. The second stage generally consists of submission of a specific site
plan for the subject property in accordance with division (f) of this section
and Section
1155.06(a), (b), (e), and (f). An administrative review and recommendation upon
the specific site plan application is then conducted by the Planning Commission
in accordance with Section
1155.06(g), (h) and (i). The City Council then, in accordance with Section
1155.06(j) and (k), reviews the specific site plan application and makes an
administrative decision to either approve the application as submitted, approve
with supplementary conditions or disapprove.
      (2)   Single stage/concurrent review process. At the applicant's option
the first and second stage of the two-stage review process may be combined for
a single stage/concurrent review process. If the applicant elects such option,
a PUD zoning classification application and a related specific site plan
application, in accordance with Section
1155.05(c) and
1155.06(b), shall be simultaneously submitted by the applicant and both
applications shall proceed through a single stage/ concurrent review process.
In such case, the Planning Commission shall concurrently review both
applications, but shall first make a recommendation upon the PUD zoning
classification prior to making a recommendation upon the specific site plan
application. The City Council then shall concurrently review both applications,
but shall first act upon the PUD zoning classification prior to taking
administrative action upon the specific site plan application.
   (f)    Application Completeness and Officially Filed Status. Planned unit
development and specific site plan applications shall not be considered
officially filed until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees,
and submitted to the Planning Department all information as may be required by
this Zoning Code. Completeness of an application and submission of all
necessary information is the responsibility of the applicant. Only after an
application is determined by the Director to be complete and officially filed
will application review procedures begin. Applications for specific site plan
approval that do not adhere to the substantial conformance requirements of
Section
1155.06(e) may be considered to be incomplete, not officially filed, and not
subject to city review procedures.
   (g)   Site Arrangement Requirements. The buildings, circulation, open space,
landscaping and other elements of the proposed PUD development shall be
arranged, planned and designed on the site to produce:
      (1)   Favorable relationships with the existing natural topography,
bodies of water or water courses, existing desirable vegetation, exposure to
significant views and exposure to sunlight and wind;
      (2)   Safety, convenience and ease of pedestrian and vehicular movement
on, about and throughout the site and between the site and the community;
      (3)   An overall positive visual quality throughout, into and from the
development site;
      (4)   An efficient, functionally organized, and cohesive development; and
      (5)   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvements or development shall be landscaped or otherwise
maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
      (6)   Landscaping and screening shall be as specified in Section
1187.05, the City Landscape Manual, also available at the Community Development
Department.
   (h)   Zoning Map Identification. Areas approved as a planned unit
development district will be clearly marked and identified on the zoning map by
indicating the specific PUD district upon which approval was granted, either R-
PUD, B-PUD, MX-PUD or M-PUD; followed by the appropriate case number.
   (i)   Multiple Pud Projects. A proposed PUD project, either voluntary or
mandatory, shall be considered a "multiple PUD project" when each individual
use proposed for the project is permitted by at least one of the various PUD
zoning districts (Example: RPUD), while at the same time all of the proposed
uses for the project are not permitted by only one, single PUD zoning district
(Example: R-PUD and B-PUD). A multiple PUD project requires differing PUD
district zoning classifications for respective, contiguous portions of the
property proposed for development. When the proposed development is a multiple
PUD project the applicant shall file a single PUD zoning application,
identifying each specific PUD zoning district, incorporating a functional and
general location phasing plan for each individual PUD, a functional and general

shall indicate the Commission is taking administrative action, and if the
Commission's recommendation is for approval with supplementary conditions, the
resolution shall fully express such conditions. If the Planning Commission
determines in order to conduct a sufficient review and make its recommendation
that additional information is required from the applicant or additional study
is required, the Commission may table consideration of the application until
such additional information is received by the Commission or the Commission's
study is complete.
   (h)   Criteria for Planning Commission Recommendation. Before making a
recommendation for approval or approval with supplementary conditions in
accordance with division (g) of this section, the Planning Commission shall
find, by resolution, that the facts submitted with the specific site plan
application and presented at the public hearing, and any modifications,
amendments or supplementary conditions, satisfy the standards and criteria for
specific site plan approval as per division (k) of this section.
   (i)   City Council Public Hearing and Action. Within ten days after the
receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, the Clerk of the City
Council shall set a date for a public hearing and such hearing, notwithstanding
Section
1127.02(c) of the Codified Ordinances, shall be held as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter, not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of the
original Planning Commission recommendation. The public hearing shall be for
the purposes of taking administrative action on the proposed specific site
plan. Following the scheduled hearing the City Council shall, by motion, either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the proposed
specific site plan. Approval of such motion requires a vote of at least four
members of the Council. If the Council approves the specific site plan with
supplementary conditions, the motion for approval shall fully set forth such
conditions and be fully recorded in the meeting minutes. As the basis for City
Council approval of a specific site plan, with or without supplementary
conditions, Council shall find that the facts submitted with the application
and any accompanying materials, and any modifications, amendments or
supplementary conditions satisfy the standards and criteria for specific site
plan approval as per division (k) of this section. If the standards and
criteria of division (l) of this section are not satisfied, Council shall
disapprove the specific site plan and shall make findings of fact indicating
which particular standards and criteria are not satisfied. If the City Council
determines in order to conduct a sufficient review and make its decision that
additional information is required from the applicant or additional study is
required, the Council may table consideration of the application until such
additional information is received by the Council or the Council's study is
complete. Any decision rendered by City Council shall be completed within 60
days from the Planning Commission’s recommendation (City Charter Section
7.2)
   (j)   Notice of City Council Public Hearing. Before holding the public
hearing specified In division (i) of this section, notice shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1127.02(c) of this code. Notwithstanding Section
1127.02(c) of this code, notice shall also be provided by certified mail at
least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed
given on the date of mailing. Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners of
property within 200 feet from the exterior boundaries of the PUD zoning
property which contains the area proposed for specific site plan approval.
Mailed, newspaper, and any forms of notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice
shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the
proposed specific site plan. The failure to deliver the notice as provided in
this section shall not invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the
application.
   (k)   Standards and Criteria for Specific Site Plan Approval. A specific
site plan shall only be approved when the following standards and criteria are
satisfied.

acceptance must be filed with the application.
         (Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.07 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE
CONDITIONS.
   If any portion of property included in a planned unit development is sold or
leased, the PUD zoning classification and specific site plan obligations shall
continue to be binding upon all subsequent owners or lessees, regardless of the
acreage involved in the sale or lease. As a matter of procedure, all terms and
conditions of any planned unit development zoning classification and specific
site plan that were approved by the City Council in the past or may be approved
in the future shall remain binding upon and enforceable against the subject
tract of land, except to the extent modified in accordance with Section
1155.10(a) through (c).
(Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.08 MODIFICATIONS TO PUD PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses for an approved PUD development include all uses
identified as permitted and accessory uses for the type of PUD district under
which the PUD development was approved, except those uses expressly identified
as excluded uses in the ordinance granting PUD zoning approval for the subject
property (Example: The permitted uses for an approved B-PUD development include
all uses permitted in the B-PUD District, except any uses listed as excluded
uses in the ordinance which granted B-PUD zoning for the property on which the
development is located). Upon PUD zoning approval, an applicant is not required
to develop all uses permitted for the applicant's specific PUD development,
however, an applicant shall only develop those uses permitted for the specific
PUD development. Any request to modify or change the permitted uses of a
specific PUD development, as such uses are identified in Sections
1155.11(b),
1155.12(b),
1155.12(b) and
1155.14(b), and as may be conditioned by the original ordinance granting PUD
zoning classification for the subject property, requires an amendment to such
ordinance. Upon a request to modify or change the permitted uses for a specific
PUD, the City, at its discretion, shall require the applicant to either submit
a new, full application in accordance with Section
1155.05(c), or submit a modified PUD zoning application, or submit
supplementary materials to accompany the original PUD zoning application
materials. In all cases, proposed amendments to the original zoning ordinance
shall be subject to review and approval procedures in accordance with Section
1155.05(d) - (i). (Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.09 SIMILARITY OF USES AND SPECIAL USES.
   (a)   Similarity of Uses. The Planning Commission shall have the appropriate
power and duty to determine if uses not specifically mentioned in this Zoning
Code are similar to uses permitted in planned unit development districts. In no
event shall a determination of similarity of use by the Planning Commission
overrule a City Council determination of exclusion of uses from a specific PUD,
and the ordinance originally granting or amending PUD zoning classification
shall govern. If a PUD zoning classification application includes a list of
intended uses, which requires a determination of similarity, the Planning
Commission shall make such determination at the time of its review and
recommendation on the PUD zoning application.
   (b)   PUD Special Uses. Notwithstanding Chapter
1117 of the Codified Ordinances, City Council shall have the appropriate power
and duty to hear and decide upon applications for special uses, which are
requested to be approved uses within a PUD. The Planning Commission shall make
a recommendation of approval, denial, or approval with conditions for PUD
special use applications. After receipt and consideration of the Commission
recommendation, the Council shall either approve, deny or approve with
conditions the special use application. In approving a PUD special use
application, the Council may attach appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code and the Commission's
recommendation. Approval of a special use application shall expire one year
after the effective date of City Council approval, unless actual construction
has started for the special use.
(Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.10 MODIFICATIONS TO APPROVED SPECIFIC SITE PLANS.
   Requests to modify an approved specific site plan, when such requested
modification does not involve a change of permitted uses for the specific PUD,
may be approved by administrative action. Requests to modify shall be in
writing and signed by the property owner. The Director shall determine the type
and amount of any additional information necessary for consideration of the
modification. Modifications shall be considered either major, minor or
incidental, and shall be approved or disapproved by administrative action in
accordance with divisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section. Requests to modify
an approved specific site plan which involve a change of PUD permitted uses
shall be considered a modification to PUD permitted uses and shall comply with
Section
1155.08.
   (a)   Major Modifications. Major modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of 5% or more in building coverage; a 5% or greater increase in
dwelling unit density; a significant redesign of roadways, or drainage; an
increase of greater than five feet in the height of a non-related building
structure; major redesign of a building which significantly alters the central
architectural design or theme of the building; or modifications not considered
to be of minor or incidental character. Major modifications to an approved
specific site plan require resubmission of a specific site plan application in
accordance with Section
1155.06(d). At its discretion and in lieu of compliance with Section
1155.06(d), the Planning Commission may require the applicant to either submit
a modified application or submit supplementary materials to accompany the
original specific site plan application materials. In all cases major
modifications to approved specific site plans shall be subject to review and
approval procedures in accordance with Section
1155.06(f) thru (l).
   (b)   Minor Modifications. Minor modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of less than 5% in building coverage; an increase of less than 5%
in dwelling unit density; changes not exceeding 25 feet in building location
not affecting front yard setbacks from streets or setbacks from exterior
property lines of the PUD; an increase of more than two feet but less than five
feet in the height of any non-related building structure; minor redesign of a
building such as significant alterations to exterior materials or colors,
provided the redesign does not significantly alter the central architectural
design or theme of the building; or changes not considered to be of major or
incidental modification character. The Planning Commission shall, by motion,
approve or disapprove minor modifications to approved specific site plans. Such
approval shall be based on a Commission determination that the modifications
are not in conflict with the intent and character of the approved specific site
plan and such modifications do not change the permitted uses for the specific
PUD. Minor modifications do not require a public hearing and Planning
Commission's decision shall be final.
   (c)   Incidental Modifications. Incidental modifications are defined as
modifications which do not change the PUD's permitted uses and do not exceed
any of the limitations and conditions of the PUD's approval ordinance, and
which result in less building coverage due to decreasing the size of
structures; a decrease in the number of structures; a decrease in the number of
dwelling units in a R-PUD or MX-PUD; minor redesign of PUD streets, such as
adjustments in a turning radius; minor redesign, such as a realignment, of
pedestrian circulation facilities or parking or loading areas; changes in
landscaping or screening materials that do not alter the intended function of
the landscaping or screening; an increase of two feet or less in the height of
a building or structure; minor revisions of building elevations such as
realignment of major building entrances or window placement, or significant
alterations to exterior building materials or colors, provided the revisions do
not alter the central design or architectural theme of a building; or changes
not considered to be of minor or major modification character. The Director
shall approve or disapprove incidental modifications to approved specific site
plans. Such approval shall be based on the Director's determination that the
modifications are not in conflict with the intent and character of the approved
specific site plan and such modifications do not change the permitted uses for
the specific PUD. In the alternative and at the discretion of the Director, the
Director may request that incidental modifications be approved by the Planning
Commission.
      (Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.11 R-PUD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. This District is intended to provide flexibility in the
arrangement and design of residential dwellings, based upon a unified
development plan conceived and carried out for the entire PUD tract. Within
this District, appropriate and reasonable population density is maintained
while a variety of dwelling unit types is permitted. Developers are encouraged
to retain, to the degree possible, natural features such as topography, trees,
and drainage ways. Such developments are generally characterized by a
significant proportion of usable open space, a unified design concept with
particular attention devoted to the periphery of the development, with the
objective of compatibility of the development with its surroundings.
   (b)   R-PUD Permitted and Special Uses.
      (1)   Those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in the
following listed residential districts are permitted in a R-PUD District: R2,
R2A, R3, and R4. One or more of these permitted and accessory uses may be
excluded from the specific R-PUD when the City Council determines that the
specific permitted or accessory use normally allowed in the listed residential
districts is inappropriate for the specific R-PUD development. Such exclusion
(s) shall be based upon at least one of the following findings that the
specific excluded use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the city's land use plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection;
         B.   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; and
         C.   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with Section
1155.09 and the issuance of a special use permit, those uses included as
special uses in the following listed residential districts are allowed in a R-
PUD: R-2, R2A, R3 and R4.
   (c)   Coverage. For R-PUD developments, the coverage of the total gross area
of the development shall not exceed 45%. For the purposes of this section,
coverage shall be interpreted to include the area covered by all buildings, all
parking areas, all driveways, and all public streets, access easements and
paved rights-of way. Structures and other impervious surfaces included within,
and developed as an integral part of an area of open space may, at the sole
discretion of the Planning Commission and City Council, be excluded from the
coverage of the total gross area percentage. Developers of R-PUD's are
encouraged to achieve an approximate equal distribution of coverage for each
individual phase or sub-area of the total PUD.
   (d)   Land Use Density. The overall gross density of an R-PUD shall not
exceed 15 dwelling units per acre. The Planning Commission may recommend and
the City Council may impose a maximum overall gross density of less than 15
units per acre. In this section gross density shall be interpreted to mean the
measure of residential land use intensity, calculated by dividing the total
number of dwelling units proposed for the site by the total acreage of the
site. (Example: 43 total dwelling units divided by ten acres = 4.3 dwelling
units per acre)
   (e)   Building Height. No building shall be erected in excess of 50 feet in
height, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the maximum height may
be increased when such increase is determined to improve site design and the
overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not adversely affect
surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not obscure light and air
sources to immediately surrounding structures, and satisfies applicable fire
and safety regulations.
   (f)   Requirements for Screening, Accessory Parking, and Loading and
Unloading Areas. All screening and buffering shall meet the requirements of
Section
1187.13, accessory parking shall meet the requirements of Sections
1187.03-
07, and loading and unloading areas shall meet the requirements of Sections
 1187.08-
12. Upon approval of the City Council, any of these requirements may be
modified, provided that such modification will increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, will improve site design, will
not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, and the
purpose of such modification is not to circumvent the intent of the respective
section.
      (1)   New residential development proposed to be located adjacent to a
major highway or railroad system shall provide noise barriers consisting of an
earthen mound, solid masonry walls, permanent engineered sound barriers, or
other similarly effective methods or materials along the entire length of the
right-of-way abutting the project. The height of the barrier shall protect all
residential structures to a point conforming to the minimum and maximum Ohio
Department of Transportation Standards.
      (2)   If any habitable area of the residential structures would not be
completely screened by the noise barriers, the project developer shall either
extend the height of the barrier to provide such protection or incorporate
noise reduction measures in the residential structures. Such measures include
but are not limited to increased setback of structures from highway right-of-
way, utilizing materials that increase sound resistance, using construction
methods to provide air space and reduce vibration, sealing cracks around doors
and windows, reducing window sizes and installing double glazed windows. In
preparing plans for the above described noise reduction, developers shall be
guided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Noise Guide
Book.
   (g)   Signs. See Chapter
1189 for size and location of permitted signs. In conjunction with and at the
same time as submission of a specific site plan application, applicant may
submit a proposed sign limitation and control package specifically fashioned
for the PUD development.
   (h)   Landscaping and Screening. See Section
1187.05, the City Landscape Manual, also available at the Community Development
Department.

   (a)   Purpose. This district is intended to provide for the development of
business, office and commercial establishments within a unified commercial area
and plan of development. Within this district, business, office and commercial
establishments can be flexibly located to achieve compatible exterior physical
design, to utilize the site more efficiently than allowed by standard zoning
regulations, to take advantage of natural features of the site, to achieve a
higher degree of pedestrian and vehicular separation, to eliminate undesirable
features of strip commercial development, to reduce vehicular traffic conflicts
within the site and with public rights-of-way, and to enhance compatibility of
the development with its surroundings.
   (b)   B-PUD Permitted and Special Uses.
      (1)   The following listed uses are included as permitted and accessory
uses in the B-PUD Zoning District: convention, conference and banquet
facilities; and those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in the B-1,
B-2, zoning districts. One or more of these permitted and accessory uses may be
excluded from the specific B-PUD when the City Council determines that the
specific permitted or accessory use is inappropriate for the specific B- PUD
development. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the
following findings that the specific excluded use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City's land use plan
or other approved plans of the City; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; and
         B.   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; and
         C.   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with Section
1155.09 (b) and the issuance of a special use permit, those uses included as
special uses in the following listed zoning districts are allowed in a B-PUD:
B1, and B2. (Took out Wireless Special Use)
   (c)   Land Use Intensity. For B-PUD developments, the maximum land use
intensity and lot coverage by all buildings, and by buildings and all other
impervious surfaces is as follows:
      Maximum Coverage by All Buildings: 35%
      Maximum Cover by All Buildings and Impervious Surfaces: 75%
   (d)   Building Height. The maximum height of any building in a B-PUD
District shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the
maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, and
satisfies applicable fire and safety regulations.
   (e)   Requirements for Screening, Accessory Parking, and Loading and
Unloading Areas.
      (1)   All screening and buffering shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.13, accessory parking shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.08-
12, and loading and unloading areas shall meet the requirements of Section

07. Upon approval of the City Council, any of these requirements may be
modified, provided that such modification will increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, will improve site design, will
not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, and the
purpose of such modification is not to circumvent the intent of the respective
section.
      (2)   Any commercial development proposed to be located within 1,000 feet
of any existing or proposed residential district or project shall present and
implement plans for providing a barrier from noise generated by the activities
of the commercial development. These activities include but are not limited to
loading dock and delivery activities, truck movements, idling and parking,
waste collection, compactor or shredding activities, roof mounted and ground
mounted mechanical equipment, and parking lots and driveways. Methods, which
may be utilized include earthen mounding, solid masonry walls, permanent
engineered sound barriers, or other methods or materials of equal affect as
those listed above.
   (f)   Signs. See Chapter
1189 for size and location of permitted signs. In conjunction with and at the
same time as submission of a specific site plan application, applicants may
submit a proposed sign limitation and control package specifically fashioned
for the PUD development.

   (a)   Purpose. This district is intended to provide for the development of
business, office and commercial establishments, and varied residential living
opportunities within a unified plan of development. An MX-PUD must include
residential uses. Within the planned development, selected residential uses can
be integrated with commercial, business and office establishments, or developed
as a sub-area with residential neighborhood characteristics. This district
provides for flexibility in locating uses, allows for utilization of the site
more efficiently than standard zoning regulations, allows for advantageous use
of natural features of the site, and allows for residential uses to be
selectively integrated with or separated from business, commercial or office
establishments.
   (b)   MX-PUD Permitted and Special Uses.
      (1)   The following listed uses are included as permitted and accessory
uses in the MX-PUD Zoning District: hotels; motels; convention, conference and
banquet facilities; and those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in
the R4, B1 and B2 zoning districts. The following uses are not permitted in an
MX-PUD District: drive-in theaters; veterinary clinics; veterinary hospitals;
and veterinarians with kennels. One or more of these permitted and accessory
uses may be excluded from the specific MX-PUD when the City Council determines
that the specific permitted or accessory use is inappropriate for the specific
MX-PUD development. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the
following findings that the specific excluded use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the city's land use plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; and
         B.   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; and
         C.   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with Section
1155.09(b) and the issuance of a special use permit, those uses included as
special uses in the following listed zoning districts are allowed in a MX-PUD:
R4, B1, and B2.
   (c)   Land Use Intensity. For MX-PUD developments, the maximum land use
intensity and lot coverage by all buildings, and by buildings and all other
impervious surfaces is as follows:
  
      Maximum Coverage by All Buildings: 35%

   (d)   MX-PUD Residential Uses. Residential uses in MX-PUD Districts are
intended to be developed as separate, residential sub-areas of the MX-PUD, with
a primary residential character, or above business, commercial and office uses.
Residential uses shall only be developed in MX-PUD Districts when the following
conditions are satisfied.
      (1)   A residential use shall only be developed at grade level, or at
grade level and higher, provided a non-residential use is not planned or
developed within a horizontal distance of at least 100 feet from the
residential use. The Planning Commission may recommend and the City Council may
impose a distance greater than 100 feet.
      (2)   If a non-residential use is planned or developed within a
horizontal distance of less than 100 feet from a residential use, residential
uses shall be developed only at the second story or higher of buildings in
which grade level use is a business, office or commercial MX-PUD District
permitted, or accessory or approved conditional use.
      (3)   The overall gross residential density of a MX-PUD shall not exceed
ten dwelling units per acre. The Planning Commission may recommend and the City
Council may impose a maximum overall gross density of less than ten dwelling
units per acre. In this section gross residential density shall be the measure
of residential land use intensity, calculated by dividing the total number of
dwelling units proposed for the site by the total acreage of the site.
   (e)   Building Height. The maximum height of any building in a MX-PUD
District shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the
maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, and

(Ord. 1474-02. Passed 9-26-02.)
1155.14 M-PUD INDUSTRIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. This district is intended to provide for the development of
varied or similar industrial establishments within a unified industrial area
and plan of development. Within this district, industrial establishments can be
flexibly located to achieve compatible exterior physical design, to utilize the
site more efficiently than allowed by conventional development standards, to
take advantage of natural features of the site, to achieve a higher degree of
pedestrian and vehicular separation, to comprehensively provide for necessary
services and facilities in accordance with a predetermined plan, to reduce
vehicular traffic conflicts within the site and with public rights-of-way, and
to enhance compatibility of the development with its surroundings.
   (b)   M-PUD Permitted and Special Uses.
      (1)   Those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in the M-1 and
M-2 Zoning Districts are permitted in an M-PUD District. One or more of these
permitted and accessory uses may be excluded from the specific M-PUD when the
City Council determines that the specific permitted or accessory use normally
allowed in the industrial Zoning Districts is inappropriate for the specific M-
PUD development. Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the
following findings that the specific excluded use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the city's land use plan
or other approved plans of the city; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; and
         B.   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; and
         C.   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.
      (2)   Upon approval by City Council in accordance with Section
1155.09(b) and the issuance of a special use permit, those uses included as
special uses in the M1and M2 Zoning District are allowed in an M-PUD. Wireless
telecommunication facilities shall automatically be a special use permitted in
all M-PUD districts, whether existing or proposed.
      (3)   Upon approval by the City Council, specifically listed permitted
and accessory uses allowed in the B1 and B2 Districts may be permitted as
permitted or special uses in an M-PUD.
   (c)   Land Use Intensity. For I-PUD developments, the maximum land use
intensity and lot coverage by all buildings, and by buildings and all other
impervious surfaces is as follows:
      Maximum Coverage by All Buildings: 40%
      Maximum Cover by All Buildings and Impervious Surfaces: 75%
   (d)   Building Height. The maximum height of any building in an I-PUD
District shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the
maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, satisfies
applicable fire and safety regulations, and is necessary for the operation of a
proposed industrial use.
   (e)   Requirements for Screening, Accessory Parking, and Loading and
Unloading Areas.
      (1)   All screening and buffering shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.13, accessory parking shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.08-
12, and loading and unloading areas shall meet the requirements of Section
1187.03-
07. Upon approval of the City Council, any of these requirements may be
modified, provided that such modification will increase benefits to the
community that are derived from the development, will improve site design, will
not adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, and the
purpose of such modification is not to circumvent the intent of the respective
section.
      (2)   Any industrial development proposed to be located within 1,000 feet
of any existing or proposed residential district or project shall present and
implement plans for providing a barrier from noise generated by the activities
of the industrial development. These activities include but are not limited to
loading dock and delivery activities, truck movements, idling and parking,
waste collection, compactor or shredding activities, roof mounted and ground
mounted mechanical equipment, and parking lots and driveways. Methods which may
be utilized include earthen mounding, solid masonry walls, permanent engineered
sound barriers, or other methods or materials of equal affect as those listed
above.
   (f)   Signs. See Chapter
1189 for size and location of permitted signs. In conjunction with and at the
same time as submission of a specific site plan application, applicants may
submit a proposed sign limitation and control package specifically fashioned
for the PUD development.
   (g)   Landscaping and Screening. See Section
1187.05, the City Landscape Manual, also available at the Community Development

1179.01 PURPOSE.
   The "WP" Well Field Protection Overlay District is designed to safeguard the
public health, safety and welfare of the customers of protected public water
supplies by regulating the land use and the storage, handling, use and/or
production of regulated substances. The area of the Well Field Protection
Overlay is described on the Official Zoning Map and includes existing and
proposed protected public water supply wells and their one (1) year capture
area. The intent of this designation is to protect the community's potable
water supply against contamination.
(Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)
1179.02 DETERMINATION.
   (a)    Applicability of Well Field Protection Overlay District to Underlying
Zoning Districts.
      (1)    The provisions of this section shall be applicable to all lands
shown as being located within the boundaries of the "WP" Well Field Protection
Overlay District on the Official Zoning Map and shall be supplemental to the
regulations of the underlying zoning district. Where the requirements of this
section are in conflict with the regulations of the underlying district, the
more restrictive regulations shall apply.
   (b)    Determination of Applicability.
      (1)    It shall be the responsibility of any person owning real property
or owning or operating a business within the City of Moraine to make a
determination of the applicability of this Section as it pertains to the
property or business or operation and failure to do so shall not excuse any
violations of this section. (Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)
1179.03 USES.
   (a)    Permitted Uses, Bulk and Yard Regulations.
      (1)    The permitted uses, bulk and yard regulations within the WP Well
Field Protection Overlay District shall be those of the underlying zoning
district, subject to any more restrictive regulations of this Overlay District.
   (b)    Special Uses.
      (1)    The special uses within the WP Well Field Protection Overlay
District shall be those of the underlying zoning districts subject to any more
restrictive regulations of this Overlay District.
   (c)    Prohibited Uses.
      (1)    Sanitary landfills, hardfills, and junkyards are prohibited within
the WP Well Field Protection Overlay District.
   (d)    Nonconforming Uses.
      (1)    If a nonconforming use of any land, building or structure is
discontinued for two (2) years or more, any further use shall be in conformity
with this District. (Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)    
1179.04 GROUNDWATER PROTECTION STANDARDS.
   (a)    Use, storage, handling and/or production of regulated substances in
conjunction with permitted and special uses in this District shall be limited
as to each use, to:
      (1)    The aggregate of regulated substances in use, storage, handling
and/or production may not exceed twenty (20) gallons or 160 pounds at any time.
   (b)    A limited exclusion from the provisions of subsection (a) hereof is
authorized for nonroutine maintenance or repair of property or equipment. The
use, storage, handling and/or production of regulated substances under this
exclusion shall be limited as to each use, to:
      (1)    The aggregate of regulated substances in use, storage, handling
and/or production may not exceed fifty-five (55) gallons or 450 pounds at any
time.
      (2)    The total use, storage, handling and/or production of regulated
substances may not exceed 110 gallons or 900 pounds in any twelve (12) month
period.
    (c)    A limited exclusion from the provisions of subsection (a) hereof is
authorized for each medical and research laboratory use, provided however,
regulated substances shall be stored, handled or used in containers not to
exceed five (5) gallons or forty (40) pounds of each substance and the
aggregate inventory of regulated substances shall not exceed 250 gallons or
2,000 pounds.
   (d)    A limited exclusion from the provisions of subsection (a) hereof is
authorized for regulated substances which are cleaning agents, provided however
such cleaning agents are packaged for personal or household use or are present
in the same form and concentration as a product packaged for use by the general
public, and provided the aggregate inventory of such cleaning agents as to any
use shall not exceed 110 gallons or 900 pounds at any time. In no case shall
regulated substances claimed under this exclusion include hydrocarbon or
halogenated hydrocarbon solvents.
   (e)    With the exception of a residential use of heating fuels in tanks
having a capacity equal to or less than 500 gallons, the underground storage of
fuel and lubricants for vehicle operations and fuel for building and/or process
heating in conjunction with a permitted use in this District shall be in
secondarily contained and monitored tanks. Such installations shall be subject
to approval by the Zoning Officer.
   (f)    Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, nonconforming uses
in this District presently utilizing underground storage tanks for fuel and
lubricants for vehicle operations and fuel for building and/or process heating
shall be permitted to replace existing tanks with those constructed as per the
specifications of subsection (e) hereof and not exceeding the capacity of
existing tanks. Replacement of underground tanks for regulated substances other
than the above noted fuels and lubricants is not permitted.
   (g)    No substitutions of a nonconforming use shall be permitted which
result in an increase of the hazardous potential ranking system on a parcel
within this District. If the hazardous potential ranking decreases for a non-
conforming use for a period of one (1) year or more, the nonconforming right to
the higher hazardous potential ranking shall be deemed to have been lost
through nonuse for that period of time.
   (h)    The use and storage of regulated substances in conjunction with
public water and wastewater treatment, conveyance and operation facilities
owned, operated and maintained by Montgomery County or the public water supply
purveyor which these standards are designed to protect shall not be restricted
by this section.
   (i)    The use and storage of regulated substances in conjunction with
environmental projects monitored by US and or Ohio EPA shall not be restricted
by this section.
(Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94)
1179.05 HAZARD POTENTIAL RANKING SYSTEM FOR NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)    Any existing uses legally storing, handling, using and/or producing
regulated substances in amounts equal to or less than the requirements under
Section
1179.04 are considered conforming uses and this section does not apply. Any new
use or change of use shall maintain the conforming status of the property.
   Existing nonconforming uses shall be permitted to maintain the reported
maximum quantity for each reportable regulated substance, as determined by peak
business cycle. Existing uses and maximum quantities, in combination with a
hazard potential rating shall run with the land and be administered in
conformance with all other applicable nonconforming provisions of this Zoning
Code.
   In order to assess the risk for potential groundwater contamination, a
hazard ranking has been developed for various activities categorized by their
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code. This ranking is based on the
kind of materials commonly associated with each use looking only at the most
critical hydrologic factors.
   Table l lists the site hazard potential by land use activity on a scale of
one (l) to nine (9), with one (l) being a low hazard and nine (9) a very high
hazard. This rating is based on the intrinsic hazards posed by different land
uses and is related to the materials commonly discharged.
   Table 2 lists the hazard potential determined on the basis of material known
to be used, stored, or disposed of at a specific site.
   If the two tables referenced above indicate different site hazard potential
ratings for the SIC-coded land use activity and the materials found on-site,
the higher of the two scores is the rating for the site. (Ord. 1069-94. Passed
4-28-94.)

1181.04 STANDARDS FOR ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES IN RESIDENTIAL AND
AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   An accessory building may be erected as an integral part of a

least depth of the front yard required on such other lot fronting the side
street, and in no case shall any part of such accessory building be closer to
the side street lot lines than the least width of the side yard required for
the principal building to which it is accessory.
   (e)    No accessory use or structure in any Residential District except an
off-street parking area shall be permitted nearer to any front lot line than
sixty (60) feet, unless such use or structure is contained within or
constitutes an integral part of the principal building. However, if the owner
of a corner lot, with approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals designates the
longer street lot line as the front lot line, then the requirement of this
section shall apply to establish the permitted distance of an accessory
building from only the shorter street lot line.
   Patios, open porches and carports may be located in side and rear yards
provided they are not closer than three (3) to any adjacent property line. If
located closer than eight (8) feet, they shall be screened by an evergreen
hedge or fence not less than four (4) feet in height and maintained in good
condition. In case of a corner lot, no patios or porches shall be closer to the
side street lot line than the least depth required for such side yard.

the dwelling unit.
      B.   The operator conducting the home occupation shall be the sole
entrepreneur, and he shall not employ any other person other than a member of

changing the residential appearance to a business appearance shall be
permitted; nor the use of mechanical equipment not customary in dwellings.
      D.   Such home occupations shall be conducted entirely within the primary
building or dwelling unit used as a residence.
      E.   No additional and separate entrance incongruent with the residential
structural design shall be constructed for the purpose of conducting the home

used for off-street parking or loading facilities, and no additional driveway
to serve such home occupations shall be permitted.
       G.   No display of goods or external evidence of the home occupation
shall be permitted, except for one (1) nonanimated, nonilluminating,
nonflashing announcement plate, indicating not more than the name and address
of the resident. Such plate shall be attached flat against the wall of the
residence and shall not exceed two (2) square foot in total surface area.
       H.    No stock in trade or commodities, other than those prepared,
produced or created on the premises by the operator of the home occupation,

than one and one-half (1 1/2) feet in depth and portable swimming pools with a
diameter less than twelve (12) feet or with an area of less than 100 square

conditions and requirements.
      (1)    The pool is intended and is to be used solely for the enjoyment of
the occupants and guests of the principal use of the property on which it is
located.
      (2)    The pool may not be located closer than ten (10) feet to any
property line, and such location shall be in accordance with all pertinent
provisions of Section
1181.01 hereof and shall be measured from the water line. Accessory buildings
shall maintain the minimum side yard required. Any walks or paved areas
adjacent to the pools shall be considered as patios for the purpose of this
Zoning Code and shall conform to the provisions of subsection (e) hereof.
      (3)    The swimming pools, or the entire rear yard of the property on
which it is located, shall be walled or fenced to prevent uncontrolled access
by children from the street or from adjacent properties. Such fence or wall
shall be six (6) feet in height and maintained in good condition with a gate
and lock.
   (h)    Tennis Courts. Tennis courts and other similar playing courts may be
located in any rear yard with the fence located no closer than five (5) feet of
any property line, provided the location of such courts are in accordance with
all pertinent provisions of this section. Such courts may be fenced with a
chain link fence located around the perimeter of the court, but any fence over
six (6) feet in height shall be planted with large shrubs in sufficient
quantities to screen and filter the view of the fence from neighboring
properties.

observed from all property lines. This distance shall be measured horizontally
from the perpendicular to that part of the structure nearest the property line;
and
      (4)    Roof mounted stations or antennas shall be considered accessory
structures and shall comply with the following conditions and requirements:
         A.    Such stations or antennas shall be mounted directly on the roof
of a primary or accessory structure and shall not be mounted on appurtenances
such as chimneys, towers or spires.
         B.    Such stations or antennas mounted on the roof of a primary or
accessory structure shall not exceed a height of greater than four (4) feet
above the roof on which they are mounted nor extend beyond the edge of the roof
line. The height shall be measured vertically from the point at which such
station or antenna is mounted on the roof.
         C.    The diameter of any dish antenna mounted upon the roof of a
primary or accessory structure shall not exceed four (4) feet.
      (5)    No more than one (1) dish-type antenna will be permitted on any
one lot.

   (j)    Accessory Fences, Walls and Hedges. The intent of these provisions is
to outline the regulations for accessory fences, walls and hedges in
residential districts. Such structures are permitted in order to: provide for

three (3) feet above the ground at any point.
             2.    Any ornamental fence or wall, as permitted in the
subsection, shall be so constructed as to provide a ratio of solid portion to

(Ord 1069-94 Passed 4-28-94.)
 
1187.02 SCOPE.
   (a)    For all buildings and structures erected and all uses of land
established after the effective date of this Zoning Code, accessory parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as required by the regulations of the
district in which such buildings or uses are located. However, where a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code and
provided that construction is begun within six (6) months of such effective
date and diligently pursued to completion, parking and loading facilities in
the amounts as are required for the issuance of such building permit may be
provided in lieu of any different amounts required by this Zoning Code.
   (b)    When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises
shall be increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area,
seating capacity or other units of measurement specified herein for required
parking or loading facilities, parking and loading facilities as required
herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use and for at least
fifty percent (50%) of any existing deficiency in parking or loading
facilities.
   (c)    Whenever the existing use of a building or structure shall hereafter
be changed to a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as
required for such new use. However, if such building or structure was erected
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Code, additional parking or loading
facilities are mandatory only in the amount by which the requirements for the
new use would exceed those for the existing use, if the latter were subject to
the parking and loading provisions of this Zoning Code.

that such spaces are readily identified.
   (b)    Width of Parking Area Aisles and Driveways.
      (1)    Parking area aisle widths shall conform to the following table,
which varies the width requirement according to the angle of parking.

one-way traffic and twenty-one (21) feet in width for two-way traffic, except
that thirteen (13) feet-wide driveways are permissible for two-way traffic when
the driveway is not longer than fifty (50) feet, it provides access to not more
than six (6) spaces, and sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles
need not back into a public street.
   (c)    Design and Construction Standards.
      (1)    Off-street parking may be open to the side, or enclosed in a
building or structure, either above or below ground. Off-street parking areas
shall meet acceptable engineering standards as set forth by the City Engineer
for such things as driveway widths, island design, curbs, barriers, grades,
radii, vertical clearance, stacking and waiting areas and drainage.
         A.    Each off-street parking space shall open directly onto an aisle
or driveway of such width and design to provide safe and efficient means of
vehicular access to the parking space, and which, except for single-family and
two-family residences (not fronting upon a major collector or arterial
thoroughfare), does not require a vehicle to back into a public street.
         B.    Such aisle or driveway shall not be used for parking of other
vehicles, except that the driveway of a single-family or two-family residence
shall be counted as parking spaces for such dwelling unit, the number of spaces
being dependent on a determination by the Zoning Administrator based on the
size and accessibility of such driveway.
         C.    Any new driveway opening onto a public street requires a
driveway permit from the City Engineer.
         D.    No part of any parking space except for single-family and two
family residence shall be closer than ten (10) feet to any established street
right of way or alley line as shown on the Official Thoroughfare Plan.
      (2)    Surfacing and curbing. Except for temporary parking permitted

timber or similar material, but shall not be made of asphalt.
      (3)    Wheel stops. Wheel stops shall be installed at least thirty (30)
inches from an adjacent sidewalk, fence or wall. Such stops shall be either a
concrete piece at least thirty-six (36) inches long and permanently affixed to
a foundation; a continuous concrete curb, or other appurtenance or design
features that prohibit a vehicle from obstructing a sidewalk or making contact
with a wall or fence. However, a sidewalk adjacent to a building may be used
for vehicle overhang if such sidewalk is a minimum of five and one-half (5-1/2)
feet in width.

(Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)
1187.05 OFF-STREET PARKING LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following provisions are to be considered minimum landscaping
requirements for the conditions defined herein. In cases in which respective
zoning districts require greater yard setbacks, and/or landscaping, those
requirements shall prevail.
   Wherever in any zoning district off-street facilities are provided for
parking or any other vehicular uses as provided in Section
1187.02, such off-street facilities and land shall conform to the minimum
landscaping requirements set forth in this section, except, that single and
two-family residential uses on individual platted lots and multi-level parking
structures shall be exempt from such requirements. All landscaped areas shall
be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs, wheel stops and other
similar devices. Existing trees, as defined herein, may be used to meet the
requirements of this section.
   (a)    Plant Material.
      (1)    Trees. All trees shall be species having an average mature spread
or crown of greater than fifteen (15) feet in the Miami Valley area and having
trunk(s) which can be maintained in a clean condition over five (5) feet of
clear wood. Trees having an average mature spread or crown less than fifteen
(15) feet may be substituted by grouping the same so as to create the
equivalent of a fifteen (15) foot crown spread. Tree species shall be a minimum
of eight (8) feet overall height immediately after planting. Trees of species
whose roots are known to cause damage to public roadways or other public works
shall not be planted closer than six (6) feet to such public works, unless the
tree root system is completely separated by a barrier.
      (2)    Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs shall be a minimum of two (2) feet in
height when measured immediately after planting. Hedges, where required, shall
be planted and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual
screen within a maximum of one (1) year after time of planting. Plant spacing
will be three (3) feet on center at installation.
   (b)    Development Standards.
      (1)    Required landscaping adjacent to public right of way. On any
parcel providing an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area in
excess of three thousand (3,000) square feet or ten (10) spaces, where such
area will not be entirely screened visually by an intervening building or
structure from any abutting right of way, excluding alleys, there shall be
provided landscaping between such area and such right of way as follows:
         A.    A strip of land at least ten (10) feet in depth located between
the abutting right of way and the off-street parking area or other vehicular
use area which is exposed to an abutting right of way shall be landscaped to
include an average of one (1) tree for each fifty (50) linear feet or fraction
thereof. Such trees shall be located between the abutting right of way and off-
street parking area or other vehicular use area.
         B.    In addition, a hedge, wall or other opaque durable landscape
barrier of at least two (2) feet in height shall be placed along the entire
length of such landscaped area. If such opaque durable barrier is of nonliving
material, for each ten (10) feet thereof, an average of one (1) shrub or vine
shall be planted abutting such barrier but need not be spaced ten (10) feet
apart. Such shrubs or vines shall be planted along the street side of such
barrier unless they are of sufficient height at the time of planting to be
readily visible over the top of such barrier. The remainder of the required
landscaped areas shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other
landscape treatment.
      (2)    Required landscaping adjacent to interior property lines. On any
parcel providing an off-street parking area or other vehicular use area, there
shall be provided landscaping between such area and such property line as
follows:
         A.    Where such area abuts property zoned or, in fact, used primarily
for residential or institutional purposes that portion of such area not
entirely screened visually by an intervening structure or existing conforming
buffer from an abutting property, there shall be provided a landscaped buffer.
Such landscaped buffer shall be located between the common lot line and the
off-street parking area or other vehicular use area exposed to the abutting
property so that the purpose of screening the off-street parking area or other
vehicular use area is accomplished. The vertical requirement for such
landscaped buffer area may be reduced to not less than three (3) feet where the
only vehicular use area to be screened is a driveway not exceeding ten (10)
feet in width.
         B.    In addition, an average of one (1) tree shall be provided for
each fifty (50) lineal feet of such interior property line or fractional part
thereof. Such trees shall be located between the common lot line and the off-
street parking area or other vehicular use area. Each such tree shall be
planted in at least 150 square feet of planting area with a minimum dimension
of at least eight (8) feet. Each such planting shall be landscaped with grass,
ground cover or other landscape material excluding paving in addition to the
required tree.
         C.    Where such area abuts a dedicated alley or property zoned and,
in fact, used for office, commercial or industrial purposes and exceeds 3,000
square feet or ten (10) spaces, only the tree provision with its planting area
as prescribed in this subsection shall be required.
      (3)    Required vehicular use area interior landscaping.
         A.    Off-street parking areas in excess of 3,000 square feet or ten
(10) spaces shall have at least ten (10) square feet of interior landscaping
for each parking space excluding those spaces abutting a perimeter for which
landscaping is required by other sections thereof.
         B.    Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum of 150
square feet and shall have a minimum dimension of at least eight (8) feet and
shall include at lease one (l) tree, with the remaining area adequately
landscaped with shrubs, ground cover or other landscaping material. The total
number of trees shall not be less than one (1) for each 100 square feet or
fraction thereof of required interior landscaping area. Such landscaped areas
shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of
paving and at strategic points to guide traffic flow and direction.
         C.    The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped
area or walkway when such area is at least three and one-half (3- 1/2) feet in
depth per abutting parking space and protected by motor vehicle stops or
curbing. Two (2) feet of such landscaped area or walkway may be part of the
required depth of each abutting parking space.
      (4)    Sight distance for landscaping adjacent to public rights of way
and points of access. When an accessway intersects a public right of way, all
landscaping shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between two
and one-half (2-1/2) and six (6) feet within the areas of property on both
sides of an accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway
and public right-of-way lines with two (2) sides of each triangle being ten
(10) feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a
line connecting the ends of the two (2) other sides; provided that trees having
limbs and foliage trimmed in such a manner that no limbs or foliage extend into
the cross visibility area shall be allowed, and further provided they are
located so as not to create a traffic hazard. Landscaping, except required
grass or ground cover, shall not be located closer than three (3) feet from the
edge of any accessway pavement.
   (c)    Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to all new
off-street parking or other vehicular use area. At such time as existing off-
street parking or other vehicular use areas are enlarged or expanded, such
provisions shall apply to the previous existing areas as well as the new area.
Any appeal from an administrative determination relating to these regulations
shall be to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Prior to issuing occupancy permits for
new construction, implementation and completion of landscaping requirements in
off-street vehicular facilities shall be required. Where a conflict exists
between the strict application of this section and the requirements for number
of off-street parking spaces or requirements for off-street loading facilities
as found in the schedule of off-street parking and loading requirements, the
requirements of this section shall supersede the Schedule.
   (d)    Time of Completion. All tree plantings and planting screens required
by this Zoning Code shall be installed prior to occupancy or commence of use.
Where compliance with the preceding sentence is not possible because of the
season of the year, the Zoning Administrator shall grant an appropriate delay,
but shall issue no permanent zoning compliance certificate or certificate of
occupancy until completion of all required plantings. Any zoning compliance
permit or certificate of occupancy may be revoked, after thirty (30) days
written notice to the person assessed for taxes on the affected lot and to the
occupant, whenever planting screens or required tree plantings are not
maintained as required by this Zoning Code. (Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)
1187.06 COMPUTATION OF OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Number of Spaces. When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by this section results in a fractional space, the
fraction of one-half (1/2) or less may be disregarded and a fraction in excess
of one-half (1/2) shall be counted as one (1) parking space.
   (b)    Units of Measurement. For the purpose of determining off-street
parking requirements, the following units of measurement shall apply:
      (1)    Floor area. Floor area for nonresidential purposes shall be the
sum of the gross horizontal area of all floors of a building measured from the
exterior faces of the exterior walls.
      (2)    Hospital beds. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted as
beds.
      (3)    Places of public assembly.
         A.    Benches. In stadiums, sports areas, churches and other places of
assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or other similar
seating facilities, each twenty (20) inches of such seating facilities shall be
counted as one (1) seat.
         B.    Fixed seats and assembly areas. In cases where a place of
assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be
computed separately for each type and added together.
      (4)    Employees on the largest work shift. Employees on the largest work
shift means the maximum number of employees which could be employed at a
facility, regardless of the time period during which this occurs and regardless
of whether any such person is a full-time employee. The largest work shift may
be a particular day of the week or a lunch or dinner period in the case of a
restaurant.
      (5)    Capacity. Capacity means the maximum number of persons which may
be accommodated by the use as determined by its design or by fire code
regulations, whichever is greater. (Ord. 1069-94. Passed 4-28-94.)

   (a)    Issuance. The application, plans and specifications filed by an

Administrator. Such plans may be reviewed by other City departments to check
compliance with laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the Building
and Zoning Administrator is satisfied that the work described in an application
for permit and the plans filed therewith conform to the requirements of the
Codified Ordinances and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the
applicable fee specified in Section
1305.03 has been paid, he shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant.
   When the Building and Zoning Administrator issues the permit, he shall
endorse in writing or stamp on both sets of plans and specifications
"APPROVED". Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed,
modified or altered without authorization from the Building and Zoning
Administrator, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved
plans.
   The Building and Zoning Administrator may issue a permit for the
construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and
specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or
approved provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed
complying with all pertinent requirements of the Codified Ordinances. The
permittee shall proceed at his own risk without assurance that the permit for
the entire building or structure will be granted.
(Ord. 1392-00. Passed 10-12-00; Ord. 1798-11. Passed 4-14-11.)
   (b)    Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, specifications and

therein, and one set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to
the applicant and kept on such building or work site at all times during which
the work authorized thereby is in progress.
(Ord. 1978-11. Passed 4-14-11.)
   (c)    Validity. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans
and specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for or an approval of
any violation of any of the provisions of the Codified Ordinances. No permit
presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of the Codified
Ordinances shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it
authorizes is lawful.
(Ord. 1392-00. Passed 10-12-00.)
   (d)    Expiration. Every permit issued by the Building and Zoning
Administrator under the provisions of this chapter shall expire by limitation
and become null and void, if the building or work authorized by such permit is
not commenced within 365 days from the date of such permit or if the building
or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for 180 days at any
time after work is commenced.

roofs or in which the same are overloaded to a dangerous degree, or which have
insufficient strength to be reasonably safe for the purpose used.
   (d)    Structures which have been so damaged by fire, wind or other causes
as to no longer provide adequate shelter from the elements or have become
dangerous to life, health, safety, morals or the general welfare of the
occupants or the public.

health or safety of the occupants or the general public because of the
location, general conditions, state of the premises or overcrowding. (Ord. 290.
Passed 9-23-69.)
1311.02 INSPECTION AND NOTICE.
   When any building or structure in the City is reported to the Building and
Zoning Inspector to be dangerous to the public or to the persons occupying or
using such building, or unfit for human habitation or occupancy, the Building
and Zoning Inspector shall inspect such building. If any building or structure
or portion thereof is upon inspection found to be imminently dangerous to the
public or unfit for occupancy, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall
immediately notify the owner of the property of the condition so found by his
inspection, and shall order the owner to vacate the structure and institute the
necessary repairs or other corrective measures. Such order shall be in writing,
specifying the building, structure or portion thereof found to be dangerous or
unfit, and specify the repairs to be made thereto, and direct such owner to
cause such repairs to be made, or the building or structure to be demolished.
The order shall direct that such repairs or demolition commence within a period
of thirty days from service of notice and to proceed with repairs so commenced,
or with demolition without interruption and with diligence until completed.
(Ord. 290. Passed 9-23-69.)
1311.03 METHOD OF NOTICE.
   The notice and order provided for above shall be served upon the owner, and
upon any mortgagee and other person having an interest in such building, as
shown by the County land records, by handing a copy thereof to such owner,
mortgagee or other interested person, or, if a corporation, by handing a copy
thereof to the president or other chief executive officer thereof or to the
managing agent thereof. If any such owner, mortgagee, interested person, chief
executive officer or managing agent cannot be found, then such service of such
order shall be made by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail to either the
address used for real property tax mailing purposes or to the last known
address of such party, and by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in
or upon the building or structure affected. (Ord. 290. Passed 9-23-69.)

any building, structure or portion thereof, ordered to vacate and/or to make
repairs or to demolish such building, structure or portion may, within thirty
days from date of service of written notice to repair or demolish as provided
above, file with the Board of Appeals written objection to such order. The
objection shall be filed with the Building and Zoning Inspector. If such
objection is filed, a hearing shall be held upon the question of whether or not
such building, structure or portion thereof is imminently dangerous to the
public safety or to the users or occupiers of such building, or unfit for human
habitation or occupancy. The owner, mortgagee or other interested party of such
building or structure shall be notified in writing of the date, time and place
of such hearing. Notice of hearing shall be so given at least forty-eight hours
in advance of the time of such hearing.
   (c)    Hearing and Decision. At any hearing before the Board, the Building
and Zoning Inspector shall report the findings made upon his inspection of such
building or structure and shall present such other evidence as may be available
in support thereof. The owner, mortgagee or other interested person shall then
be heard and the Board shall receive such evidence as may be offered tending to
rebut the findings and evidence presented by the Building and Zoning Inspector.
Thereupon, the Board shall determine whether or not such building, structure or
portion thereof is imminently dangerous to the public or to the occupants or
users of such building, or unfit for human habitation or occupancy, and if it
so finds such building, structure or portion to be unsafe or unfit, it shall
make written recommendation to Council that Council, by resolution, declare the
building or structure or portion thereof to be unsafe and imminently dangerous
and unfit for human habitation or occupancy, and order the Building and Zoning
Inspector to have such nuisance abated. (Ord. 290. Passed 9-23-69.)
1311.05 POSTING NOTICE.
   Any building, structure or portion thereof, declared as dangerous or unfit
for human habitation or occupancy shall be posted with a placard by the
Building and Zoning Inspector. Such placard shall be affixed to the building or
structure, upon the door or entrance thereto, and shall contain a declaration
that such structure is dangerous or unfit for human habitation or occupancy and
is ordered vacated. No person shall deface or remove any such placard. The
Building and Zoning Inspector shall remove such placard whenever the defects
upon which the vacation was based have been eliminated. (Ord. 290. Passed 9-23-
69.)
1311.06 VACATION AND DEMOLITION BY CITY.
   (a)    City Action and Costs. If the owner, mortgagee or other interested
person of the building or structure affected fails to comply with the order of
the Building and Zoning Inspector, or the ruling of the Board of Appeals and
Council after hearing, the Building and Zoning Inspector shall cause such
building or structure or part thereof to be vacated and may cause the same to
be repaired or demolished if the facts indicate that any delay will be
dangerous to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare. As provided
by Ohio R.C. 715.261 the costs of such repair or demolition shall be charged
against the land on which the building exists or existed, as a municipal lien,
or shall be recovered in a civil suit against the owner.
   (b)    Vacation and Demolition. In cases where the Building and Zoning
Inspector deems that there is immediate danger to the life or safety of any
person unless a dangerous or unfit building, as defined in Section
1311.01, is immediately vacated and repaired or demolished, the Building and
Zoning Inspector shall cause the immediate vacation and repair or demolition of
such dangerous or unfit building. The costs of such emergency repair or
demolition shall be charged or recovered in the same manner as provided in
subsection (a) hereof. (Ord. 290. Passed 9-23-69.)
1311.07 REHABILITATION OR RESTORATION.
   Whenever the Building and Zoning Inspector determines that a vacated
dangerous or unfit building or premises has been so repaired, reconstructed or
rehabilitated that it is in such condition as to be fit for human habitation or
occupancy, then he shall notify the owner or operator of that determination.
The Building and Zoning Inspector shall then cause the placard to be removed.

1313.02 NOISE LEVELS FOR ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (a)    The maximum allowable hourly average sound level, emitted from any
nonstationary and/or stationary noise source either singularly or in
combination, shall not exceed the limits set forth in Table I for the
respective categories of receiving zoning districts. The actual sound level
shall be determined during any measurement period which shall not be less than
sixty consecutive minutes and shall be measured.

   (b)    New Structures and Development. Prior to the approval of a zoning
change, the noise impact of the zoning change may be reviewed by the City
Engineer or his designee, identifying existing and projected noise sources and
their associated sound level. Such review shall include, but is not limited to
nonstationary as well as stationary noise sources. Adequate control measures
may be required to mitigate the impact of those identified noise sources to
effect compliance with this chapter.
   (c)    Existing Structures and Development. When the City Engineer
determines upon consultation with qualified experts as set forth in Section
1313.01(a)(7) that a public health nuisance exists with respect to noise
emitted across a property boundary, he shall determine the necessary degree of
compliance with the provisions of this chapter based upon technical and
economic feasibility and net environmental benefits.
   (d)    Correction for Ambient Conditions. Where the ambient noise level
influences a measurement at a property boundary, such noise will be accounted
for by applying the following correction factors:
TABLE 2
 
      If the ambient noise level          Add the following to
       is less than the noise           the noise limit:

1323.01 PROPERTY OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY; BOND.
   (a)    It shall be the responsibility of any owner of property within the
Municipality, during and after any development activities to provide adequate
controls of erosion and sedimentation of both a temporary and permanent nature,
during all phases of any clearing, filling, grading, construction or other
development activity which causes a disturbance to the natural terrain or
vegetative ground cover.
   (b)    It shall be the responsibility of any property owner prior to the
commencement of any activity set forth above, to submit to the City Engineer
plans and specifications for such controls and to secure the approval of such
from the City Engineer.
   (c)    The owner of the property on which the activity is proposed to be
performed shall furnish a bond conditioned upon the installation and
maintenance of such siltation and erosion control measures, which bond
instrument shall incorporate a right-of-entry to the City Manager or his
designate for the purpose of installation, reinstallation or maintenance of
siltation control measures in the event the property owner fails to install or
maintain such measures after notice in writing. (Ord. 595. Passed 1-8-81.)
1323.02 CITY PLAN APPROVAL REQUIRED; PLAN COMPLIANCE.
   It shall be unlawful to clear, fill, grade or engage in other activity which
shall disturb natural terrain or vegetative ground cover upon any property
without having first secured the approval of the City of plans and
specifications for erosion and sedimentation control; and it shall further be
unlawful to fail or neglect to conform to such plans and specifications or
approved revisions or additions, in conjunction with any such clearing,
filling, grading or other activity.    Erosion and sedimentation control within
the City shall be planned, designed, and constructed in accordance with the
Montgomery County Subdivision Drainage Regulations, latest version, unless
otherwise stated in this chapter. The erosion and sedimentation control
regulations are for new construction and redevelopment projects. Designated
City staff will fulfill the role of County Engineer in these storm drainage
regulations.
   The ODNR guidance manual "Rainwater and Land Development: Ohio Standards for
Stormwater Management, Land Development and Urban Stream Protection", latest
edition, should be used as the minimum guidance criteria for the selection and
design of erosion and sediment control BMPs.
   The City's OEPA NPDES permit (OHQ000004 or latest version) requires erosion
and sedimentation control for new construction and redevelopment projects that
disturb greater than or equal to one acre, including projects less than one
acre that are part of a larger common plan of development. These permit
requirements shall be part of these regulations. For erosion and sedimentation
control on these projects, the OEPA NPDES General Permit for Storm Water
Discharges Associated with Construction Activities (OHC000005 or latest
version) shall be part of these regulations. The property owner or his designee
shall be the permit holder. Designated City staff shall be responsible for
reviewing and inspecting the requirements of the OEP A General Permit. Earth-
disturbing activities regulated by this chapter cannot begin until all
necessary city, state, and federal permits and approvals have been granted to
the property owner or his designee.
(Ord. 2111-22. Passed 4-14-22.)
1323.03 BASIS FOR PLANS.
   Detailed plans and specifications for effective erosion and sedimentation
control shall be based on the practical combination of the following
principles:
   (a)    Provisions should be made to effectively accommodate the concentrated
and increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development.
   (b)    All storm water BMPs shall be designed in accordance with the
Montgomery County Subdivision Drainage Regulations, latest version, and this
Chapter.
      (Ord. 2111-22. Passed 4-14-22.)
1323.99 PENALTY.
   All development and redevelopment properties are subject to inspection by
the City as needed to ensure both temporary and permanent BMPS are in
compliance with the approved development plans. If violations are observed, a
notice of violation may be issued until the identified violations cease.
   The owner or other person in possession of land who violates or fails to
comply with any of the provisions of this Chapter shall be fined not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation thereof. Each day the
violation continues shall constitute a separate offense.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
 
1325.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of
the City of Moraine, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows: (Ord. 2156-24.
Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Moraine has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. (Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-
14-23.)
1325.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and
      generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
      (Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which

1325.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any

Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In
Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade
elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
Basement
Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all
sides.
Development
Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See "Lowest Floor."
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations
are determined.
   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
City of Moraine's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction,
affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and
thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the
effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park
means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for
habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations
shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City of Moraine and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [October 15, 1981] and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other entity, including state and local governments and
agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Rev. Code §111.15(A)(2) as
any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or any
court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is:
   (1)    Built on a single chassis,
   (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
   (3)    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck, and
   (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code §4703.01 and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30,
or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone
and designated from other federal state or local sources of data including but
not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water marks,
previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the 'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
   (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

1325.23 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1325.36 et seq., Appeals and Variances.
   (d)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development. (Ord.
2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.24 USE OF PRELIMINARY FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP AND/OR FLOOD INSURANCE
STUDY DATA.
   (a)   Zone A:
      (1)   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from the
preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
      (2)   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
   (b)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
      (1)   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
         A.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         B.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not be
used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or until
all appeals have been resolved.
      (2)   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1325.35(b) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the best
data available.
   (c)   Zones B, C, and X:
      (1)   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are not
required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM which
are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are encouraged to
reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that the health,
safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
         (Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.25 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

1325.34 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1325.22(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the City Manager of the City of Moraine and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1325.34(a)(2)A. and C. thru E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Moraine specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1325.22(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (d)   Development in Areas along Holes Creek up stream of the State Route
741 Bridge A, a distance of 1,950 feet. In floodplain areas along Holes Creek
up stream of the State Route 741 bridge, a distance of 1,950 feet, development
shall cause no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge. Prior to issuance of a Floodplain Development permit the developer
shall submit a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by an Ohio
registered professional engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development
will not result in any increase in base flood elevation.
      (Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.35 STORAGE OF MATERIALS.
   Storage of materials or equipment not otherwise prohibited in Section
1325.26(b) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. (Ord. 2156-24. Passed

appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.39 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for
a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1325.39(c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. (Ord. 2156-24. Passed 3-14-24.)
1325.40 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.

   It is the intent of this chapter to establish specific regulations governing
the demolition of structures within the City of Moraine, in the interest of the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens, business concerns and
other affected sectors of the community. It is intended to protect property
values, create a more attractive economic and business climate, and to enhance
and protect the physical appearance of the community. It is further intended to
facilitate economic and residential development by requiring demolition sites
to be rendered clear and ready for future construction, thus promoting
development or, in the alternative, to ensure that demolition sites are
returned to their pre-built natural state, thus promoting open space and
curbing the deterioration of the natural environment. (Ord. 1770-10. Passed 7-
22-10.)
1329.02 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   The regulations herein set forth shall apply to and govern structures and
properties in all zoning districts, with the exception that demolition permits
approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall not be subject to
its requirements unless work approved under such permits has not commenced on
or before the date for which work is required to commence as stated on the
permit itself.
(Ord. 1770-10. Passed 7-22-10.)

parts, various and sundry debris generated by the demolition of the structure
itself, any contents of the structure that remain at the time of demolition,
and the building foundation.
   (b)   Removal of the foundation shall not be deemed complete unless and
until every element of the foundation has been broken up and removed from the
site, including all footers and material below grade, and until the removal
site has been covered with dirt and brought back level to grade. Once brought
to grade, the site shall be seeded (and protected from soil erosion until seeds
take hold) or such other landscaping as may be appropriate shall be planted,
subject to the approval of the Building and Zoning Administrator.

   When a structure or equipment is found by the Code Official to be unsafe, or
when a structure is found unfit for human occupancy, a public nuisance, or is
found unlawful, such structure shall be condemned pursuant to the provisions of
this code.
   (a)   Unsafe structure. An unsafe structure is one that is found to be
dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public or the
occupants of the structure by not providing minimum safeguards to protect the
public or the occupants or because such structure contains unsafe equipment or
is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated, structurally unsafe, or of such faulty
construction or unstable foundation, that it creates a safety hazard.
   (b)   Unsafe equipment. Unsafe equipment includes any boiler, heating
equipment, elevator, moving stairway, electrical wiring or device, flammable
liquid containers or other equipment on the premises or within the structure
which is in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to
life, health, property or safety of the public or occupants of the premises or
structure.
   (c)   Structure unfit for human occupancy. A structure is unfit for human
occupancy whenever the Code Official finds that such structure is unsafe,
unlawful or, because of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or
lacks maintenance, is unsanitary, vermin or rat infested, contains filth and
contamination, or lacks ventilation, illumination, sanitary or heating
facilities or other essential equipment required by this code, or because the
location of the structure constitutes a hazard to the occupants of the
structure or to the public.
   (d)   Unlawful structure. An unlawful structure is one found in whole or in
part to be a public nuisance, or which was erected, altered or occupied
contrary to law.

1405.02 ABANDONMENT OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECT.
   Any building or structure for which a Building Permit has been issued, and
except for circumstances beyond the property owner's control (e.g., labor
strikes, inclement weather, etc.), all construction work shall be diligently
pursued to completion. Any construction project, upon which no substantial work
has been undertaken for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days, shall be
deemed abandoned. Upon any construction project being deemed abandoned, all
buildings or structures not completed to the degree such buildings or
structures have been indicated on the plans submitted in support of a Building
Permit, and all building materials and construction equipment shall be removed
from the site or declared a public nuisance.
(Ord. 1459-02. Passed 5-9-02.)
1405.03 CLOSING OF VACANT STRUCTURES.
   If the structure is vacant and unfit for human habitation and/or occupancy,
and is not in danger of structural collapse, the code official is authorized to
post a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed
up so as not to be an attractive nuisance.
   (a)   Storage. No outdoor storage of any type, no vehicles of any type nor
any portable or movable object may be stored on the premises except within a
completely enclosed structure.
   (b)   Method of Closure. If a building remains vacant for a period of 6
months, the doors and windows of the building shall be closed by durable means
such as plywood which shall be painted the same color as the building so as not
to be obtrusive.
   (c)   Failure to Comply. Upon failure of the owner to close up the premises
within the time specified in the order, the Code Official may cause the
premises to be closed through any available public agency or by contract or
arrangement by private persons and the cost thereof shall be charged against
the real estate upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon
such real estate.

any structure or part of a structure has fallen and life is endangered by the
occupation of the structure, or when there is actual or potential danger to the
building occupants or those in the proximity of any structure because of
explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the presence of toxic fumes, gases or
materials, or operation of defective or dangerous equipment, the Code Official
is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants to vacate
the premises forthwith. The Code Official shall cause to be posted at each
entrance to such structure a notice reading as follows.
   "This Structure is Unsafe and its Occupancy has been Prohibited by the Code
Official." It shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure except
for the purpose of securing the structure, making the required repairs,
removing the hazardous condition, or of demolishing the same. (Ord. 1459-02.
Passed 5-9-02.)
1406.02 TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS.
   Notwithstanding other provisions of this code, whenever, in the opinion of
the Code Official, there is imminent danger due to an unsafe condition, the
Code Official is hereby authorized and empowered to order the necessary work to
be done, including the boarding-up of opening, to render such structure
temporarily safe whether or not the legal procedure herein described has been

to be taken as the Code Official deems necessary to meet such emergency.

requirements as to making contracts or financial commitments on behalf of the
City, the necessary labor and materials to perform the required work as
expeditiously as possible.
(Ord. 1459-02. Passed 5-9-02.)

Treasury of the City on approval of the Code Official, subject with compliance
with City Charter and ordinance requirements as to making contracts or
financial commitments on behalf of the City. The legal counsel of the City may
institute appropriate action against the owner of the premises where the unsafe
structure is or was located for the recovery of such costs. The costs of such
emergency work to correct hazardous conditions shall be certified by the
Finance Department of the City to the County Auditor as a tax lien upon the
premises in the manner provided in Ohio Revised Code 715.261. Based on the
emergency nature of such costs, notice to owners and lien holders of the
emergency work may be given by other than prescribed in Chapter

entitled to possession and reinstitution of the previously permitted commercial
use under the Moraine Zoning Code, after having obtained an inspection and all
permits required by the Moraine Zoning Code, including, but not limited to,
building permit(s); provided however that nothing within this Section shall be
construed to extend the time after which the nonconforming use of a structure,
premises, or building is deemed discontinued under Chapter
1191 of the Moraine Zoning Code; or
   (b)   Demolition and removal of all buildings on and in the premises and

abatement Compliance Agreement, or at the expiration of the time in the written
determination of the Board of Zoning Appeals, whichever is later, the Chief
Code Official shall be authorized at any time thereafter to enter upon such
premises to abate the nuisance by demolition and removal of structures or
buildings, or by taking any other such action as may be required to abate the
nuisance. In the event a fire occurs on the premises of a nuisance structure
between the time it is declared a public nuisance and the time such nuisance is
fully abated, the reasonable expenses incurred by the City as a result of
providing Fire Department services shall be included in the cost of abating or
lessening the severity of the nuisance.
   (b)   In order to abate a public nuisance, the City Manager may call upon
any department of the City for whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by
private contract, complete the abatement thereof. In abating nuisances, the
Chief Code Official shall take all reasonable actions to complete abatement of
same and the cost of the abatement shall be recovered from the owner(s).
   
   (c)   The owner(s) shall be billed directly for all costs of the abatement
and any costs incurred for lessening the severity of the public nuisance. The
bill shall be paid within sixty (60) days after receipt of the bill. The bill
shall be provided to the owner(s) as follows:
      (1)   Delivered personally to the owner(s). The Chief Code Official or
his/her designee serving said bill shall prepare a written return of service
indicating the person served and the date and time of service and file same in
the office of the Chief Code Official; or
      (2)   Sent by Certified Mail, RRR addressed to the last known address of
the owner(s). The Chief Code Official or his/her designee shall maintain the

bill is returned because service was refused or not retrieved from the post
office, then the bill is to be sent by first-class mail. The Chief Code
Official or his/her designee mailing said bill shall prepare a written return
of service indicating the person to whom the notice is mailed and the date of
mailing and file same in the office of the Chief Code Official.

the City may cause the cost of the abatement to be levied as an assessment and
recovered in accordance with O.R.C. 715.261 and/or pursuant to any other method
