Editor's Note
The numbering system used in this Code of Ordinances is similar to that used in
the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each section is
self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For example, § 238.02
indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238 (or the 38th
chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code and chapter
numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the first
two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right of the
decimal. As another example, § 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4, the
chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
With this numbering system, the Code of Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, this
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the substantive sections. Newly created
sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three
digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two
consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created §§ 660.061, 660.062
and 660.063 follow § 660.06 and precede § 660.07 to be placed in their logical
position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories are or contain
new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance which adopts this Code of
Ordinances.
The Parallel Reference Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in this Code of Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring uniform
observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time starting in 1967,
except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from daylight
savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with a
different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to

§ 224.05 INVESTMENT POLICY FOR INTERIM AND INACTIVE FUNDS; ESTABLISHING A
COMMITTEE.
   The city's investment policy for interim and inactive funds conforms to the
requirements of the Uniform Depository Act of the State of Ohio (Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135). The requirements of the Act provide a safe, conservative
framework for investment of city funds.
   (A)   Objectives and guidelines.
      (1)   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and
protection of principal while earning investment interest.
      (2)   In investing public funds, the Investment Committee will strive to
exceed or at least equal the market average rate of return on the investment
over the course of budgetary and economic cycles taking into account state law,
safety considerations and cash flow requirements.
      (3)   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable
the Treasurer to meet reasonable anticipated operating requirements.
      (4)   Since all possible cash demands cannot be anticipated, the
investment portfolio should consist of securities with active resale markets,
and with no measure of possible principal erosion in response to interest rate
shifts.
      (5)   Safety and liquidity is most important. Investments are limited to
low risk securities with the expectation of earning a fair return relative to
the risk assumed.
   (B)   The Investment Committee consists of the Auditor, Law Director and the
Mayor. The Auditor and Deputy Auditor are charged with the responsibility for
the operation of the city's investment program and are required to report to
the Investment Committee on a regular basis. They are also directed to refrain
from personal business activity that could conflict with the execution and
management of the investment program or impair their ability to make impartial
investment decisions. The Auditor shall maintain a monthly inventory report, a
monthly portfolio report, and a quarterly investment report of all obligations
and securities held in the city's investment portfolio. A copy of these reports
shall be filed with the board of county commissioners.
   (C)   Authorized financial institutions.
      (1)   All eligible financial institutions must meet the requirements of
the Uniform Depository Act; have a full service facility located in the city;
and have a current Agreement for Deposit of Interim and Active Funds with the
city.
      (2)   A list of authorized institutions shall be maintained by the
Treasurer. Additions and deletions to this list shall be made when deemed in
the city's best interest by the City Council.
   (D)   Authorized investments.
      (1)   Interim funds are identified as funds not needed for immediate use
but which will be needed before the end of the current depository designation
and may be invested or deposited in the following securities:
         (a)   Bonds, notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the United States;
         (b)   Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities
issued by federal government agencies, including but not limited to the Fifth
Third Bank, Star Bank and Provident Bank (all securities must be direct
issuances of the federal agency or instrumentality);
         (c)   Repurchase agreements collateralized by securities enumerated
above (repurchase agreements shall be transacted only through banks with which
the Treasurer [Deputy Treasurer] has signed a Master Repurchase Agreement);
         (d)   Bonds and other obligations of the State of Ohio;
         (e)   The State Treasury Asset Reserve of Ohio (STAR Ohio); and
         (f)   The city may also invest any monies not required within a period
of six months in bonds, notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal
and interest by the United States.
      (2)   The maximum maturity of any eligible investment is (two) years from
the date of settlement, unless the investment is matched to the specific
obligation or debt of the city.
      (3)   Investments in derivatives and in stripped principal or interest
obligations of eligible obligations are strictly prohibited. A derivative is a
financial instrument or contract or obligation whose value or return is based
upon or linked to another asset or index, or both, separate from the financial
obligation, trust account, or instrument that is created from an obligation of
a federal agency or instrumentality or is created from both is considered a
derivative instrument.
   (E)   Collateral.
      (1)   Any public depository in which the city places deposits must pledge
as collateral eligible securities of aggregate market value equal to the excess
of deposits not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
The securities pledged as collateral are pledged to a pool for each individual
financial institution in amounts equal to at least 110% of the carrying value
of all public deposits held by each institution. Obligations that may be
pledged as collateral are limited to obligations of the United States and its
agencies and obligations of any state, county, municipal corporation or other
legally constituted authority of any other state or any instrumentality of such
county, municipal corporation or other authority.
      (2)   Any and all financial institutions initiating investment
transactions with the city or executing transactions initiated by the city must
acknowledge by signing below their agreement to comply with the provision of
this investment policy.

   (G)   Admitting applicants to examination. No applicant shall be admitted to
any assembled examination more than 30 minutes after the advertised time for
beginning such examination, or after any applicant competing in any such
examination has completed his or her work and left the examination room, except
by special permission of the person in charge who, in his or her discretion,
may admit the applicant conditionally subject to the final approval or
disapproval of such admission by the Commission.
   (H)   Time limit. No applicant in any examination shall be given a longer
time on any subject than prescribed by the Commission except as an
accommodation to a disabled applicant.
   (I)   Frauds in examinations prohibited. No person or officer shall:
      (1)   Willfully or corruptly by himself or herself or in cooperation with
one or more persons defeat, deceive, or obstruct any person in respect of his
or her right of examination, appointment or employment arising under the civil
service law or under any rules and regulations prescribed pursuant thereto;
      (2)   Willfully or corruptly, falsely mark, grade, estimate, or report
upon the examination or proper standing of any person examined, registered or
certified pursuant to the provisions of the civil service law, or aid in doing
so;
      (3)   Willfully or corruptly make any false representations concerning
the results of such examinations or concerning any person examined;
      (4)   Willfully or corruptly furnish to any person any special or secret

registered or certified;
      (5)   Personate any other person, or permit or aid in any manner any
person to personate him or her, in connection with any examination,
registration, appointment, application, or request to be examined, registered
or appointed;
      (6)   Furnish any false information about himself or herself, or any
other person in connection with any examination, registration, appointment,

appointing authority, or have any person on his or her behalf solicit a favor.
      (10)   Any applicant in any examination found to be using any means of
information, other than that provided in the examination itself, such as
memoranda, pamphlets or books of any kind to assist him or her in answering the
questions shall have his or her examination papers taken up and filed with a
zero marking when the circumstances justify such action.
   (J)   Visitors at examinations. No visitor shall be admitted to the
examination room during any examination except by special permission of the
person in charge or as a reasonable accommodation for an applicant.
   (K)   Inspection of examination papers.
      (1)   Any competitor shall have the right at any time within the period
of 15 days after receiving notice of examination grade to review his or her own
papers to learn the markings given on each subject or question and to submit,
in writing for the Commission's consideration, any objection or protest he or
she may wish to make concerning the grades given. No objection or protest
concerning an examination, not submitted in writing, shall be considered unless
it relates to the conduct of examiners, the securing of unlawful assistance by
a competitor or such other circumstances in connection with an examination as
would call for an investigation on the part of the Commission, and which would
require that the information submitted be given in confidence.
      (2)   An applicant who exercises the right to inspect his or her
examination papers shall not be permitted to again take an examination for the
same classification within a four month period following the inspection, unless
an alternate form of examination is given. Inspection shall not be permitted of

questions on any examination shall relate to religious or political opinions or
affiliations.

§ 270.10 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR DISABLED EXAMINEES.
   Reasonable accommodations may be made for the testing of examinees who are
disabled. A disabled individual, for purposes of this chapter, is any person
who has a disability which substantially limits one or more major life activity
such as performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, or speaking. The
accommodations shall be those that can be reasonably made and that can be made
for an examinee to perform the duties of a position within the classification
tested. The Commission may solicit or use the services of a public or private
agency to assist in making reasonable accommodations for a disabled applicant.
The reasonableness of accommodations may take into consideration the
practicality of the accommodations required, the cost of the accommodations and
other relevant factors. If reasonable accommodations cannot be made, the
examinee may be excluded from an examination. Examinees who wish to be
accommodated are responsible for proposing a reasonable accommodation.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.11 UNSKILLED SERVICE.
   (A)   Designation of unskilled classifications and positions.
Classifications and positions within classifications designated to be unskilled
shall not be subject to competitive examination. The unskilled service shall
include classifications and positions within classifications for which it would
not be practical to determine the merit and fitness of applicants by
competitive examinations. The unskilled labor class includes classifications
for which there are minimal or no education or experience requirements.
   (B)   Appointments in the unskilled service.
      (1)   Certified appointments to positions in the unskilled service shall
be from lists of applicants registered by the Commission. All applicants shall
be required to complete an application which shall be evaluated to determine
the qualifications of applicants.
      (2)   Applicants for the unskilled service may be required to demonstrate
physical condition or capacity, experience, skills, previous employment,
education, or other qualifications as may be required by the classification or
position. Examinations may be administered to determine the qualifications of
applicants. All applicants who fulfill the requirements of the position shall
be placed on the eligible list for the kind of labor or employment sought, and
preference shall be given in employment in accordance with the rating received
from such evidence or in such test.
      (3)   If more than one applicant receives the same rating, priority in
time of application shall determine the order in which their names shall be
certified for appointment.
      (4)   Upon request of an appointing authority, stating the kind of labor
needed, the pay and probable length of employment, and the number to be
employed, the Commission shall certify from the highest on the list double the
number to be employed. From this number, the appointing authority shall appoint
the number actually needed for the particular work.
   (C)   Promotional appointments in the unskilled service. Appointments to
positions above the entry level in the unskilled service shall be made in
conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.12 ELIGIBLE LISTS.
   (A)   Posting of lists. The Commission shall keep open to public inspection
the results of each examination and eligible list of the persons who have
passed the examination and are eligible for appointment. Such persons shall
take rank upon the eligible list in the order of their relative grades.
   (B)   Merging eligible lists. Whenever it becomes necessary, while an
eligible list exists, to hold a subsequent examination in order to obtain
additional eligibles, the Commission may consolidate the existing list with the
new list by rearranging the names of those eligible therein according to their
grade. All persons whose names appear on the existing list shall have the
opportunity to compete in the second exam. Any person on such existing list who
takes the second examination shall be given the standing on the combined list
to which the higher grade received on either exam shall entitle him or her
during the continuance of the first list. Thereafter, he or she shall rank in
accordance with the grade received in the subsequent exam.
   (C)   Duration of list. The term or eligibility of each list and of the
names appearing thereon shall be fixed by the Commission at not less than one
nor more than two years. Any list that has been in effect for more than one
year may, at the discretion of the Commission, be terminated at any time in the
public interest.
   (D)   Applicants receiving same grade. In the event two or more applicants
receive the same mark in open competitive examination, priority in the time of
filing the application with the Commission shall determine the order in which
their names shall be placed on the eligible list, provided that applicants
eligible for military veteran's preference under Ohio R.C. 124.23 shall receive
priority rank on the eligible list over non-veterans on the list with a rating
equal to that of the veteran. Ties among military veterans shall be decided by
priority of filing application. In the event of two or more applicants
receiving the same mark on a promotional examination, seniority shall determine
the order in which their names shall be placed on the eligible list.
   (E)   Transfer to lower classification. At the discretion of the Commission,
the name of any eligible may, at any time, upon his or her written request, be
transferred to the eligible list for a lower classification in the same
classification series requiring qualifications of the same general character.
He or she shall be ranked thereon according to his or her original grade. The
adoption of such additional placement shall be extended to all eligibles on the
list. Appointment from any list shall remove the eligibles' names from all
lists on which they were placed under this section.
   (F)   Names not to be certified for appointment. The name of any person
appearing on an eligible list who:
      (1)   Fails to communicate with the Commission and/or with the appointing
authority, in accordance with the written instructions given to each eligible,
within six calendar days from when the notice is mailed or otherwise
transmitted to the eligible.
      (2)   Declines an appointment without reasons satisfactory to the Civil
Service Commission; or
      (3)   Cannot be located by the postal authorities; shall not thereafter
be certified to any appointing authority as eligible for appointment. His or
her name may again be certified from the eligible list if a satisfactory
explanation of the circumstances is made to the Commission.
   (G)   Disqualification of eligibles. If any time after the creation of an
eligible list the Commission has reason to believe that any person whose name
appears on the list is disqualified for appointment because of false statements
made in his or her application, disability, or other comparable reasons, such
person shall be notified and given an opportunity to be heard. If the person
fails to appear for hearing, or upon being heard, fails to satisfy the
Commission, his or her name shall be removed from the eligible list.
   (H)   Change of address. Each person on an eligible list shall file with the
Commission written notice of any change of address.
   (I)   Revocation of list. Whenever, in the judgment of the Commission,
action is deemed advisable on account of errors or fraud in connection with any
examination, a re-examination of applicants shall be ordered and the eligible
list shall be amended in accordance with results of such reexamination. After
an eligible list is prepared and posted it shall not be revoked except upon
written notice to all the eligibles. An appointment made from an eligible list
shall be considered valid even if fraud or error is discovered after the
appointment has been made, provided the person appointed was not involved in
such fraud or error.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.13 APPOINTMENTS.
   Appointments to all positions in the classified service that are not filled
by promotion, transfer or reduction, as provided by the Civil Service Laws and
the Rules of the Commission, shall be made only from those persons whose names
are certified to the appointing authority in accordance with the Civil Service
Laws and the Rules of the Commission.
   (A)   Number of names to be certified; appointment from other appropriate
lists.
      (1)   (a)   The appointing authority of the department in which a
position in the classified service is to be filled, shall notify the Commission
of that fact and the Commission shall, except as provided for in Ohio R.C.
Sections 124.30 and 124.31, certify to the appointing authority the names and
addresses of the ten candidates standing highest on the eligible list for the
classification. The Commission may certify less than ten names if ten names are
not available. When less than six names are certified to an appointing
authority, appointment from that list shall not be mandatory.
         (b)   In the event an eligible list becomes exhausted, and until a new
list can be created, or when no eligible list for such position exists, names
may be certified from eligible lists which the Commission determines to be most
appropriate for the group or classification in which the position to be filled
is classified.
      (2)   If more than one vacancy is to be filled, the number of names to be
certified shall be determined in the following manner.
         (a)   For 2 to 4 vacancies, 15 names shall be given;
         (b)   For 5 to 8 vacancies, 20 names shall be given;
         (c)   For 9 to 12 vacancies, 25 names shall be given; and
         (d)   For 13 to 16 vacancies, 30 names shall be given.
   (B)   Certification not more than four times. A person certified from an
eligible list more than three times to the same appointing authority for the
same or similar position, may be omitted from future certification to such
appointing authority, provided that certification for a temporary appointment
shall not be counted as one of such certifications.
   (C)   One of ten certified to be appointed (rule of ten).
      (1)   Upon receipt of request for certification to fill a vacancy, the
Commission shall certify to the appointing authority from the eligible list,
the names, addresses and grades of the ten or more persons standing highest on
such list who are willing to accept consideration for that appointment type.
The appointing authority shall make appointments from the certification
eligible list within 30 days and shall forthwith report to the Commission the
name of such appointee, the title of the position, the duties and
responsibilities of same, the salary or compensation thereof, and such other
information as the Commission may require in order to keep its roster.
      (2)   In appointing persons from the certification eligible list, the
rule of ten shall be followed; that is, every time a group of ten available
applicants is considered, one of said group must be appointed. Beginning at the
top of the list every person who is available, but not permanently appointed,
must be considered four times in a group of ten before his or her name may be
dropped from further consideration. When the Commission includes additional
names on a certification eligible list, the additional names may be considered
for appointment only if one or more of the persons names in the original
certification, is unavailable or fails to reply to notice of certification. For
each person in the original certification who is unavailable or fails to reply
to notice of certification, one name from the additional group may be
considered for appointment. In any case, the rule of ten as defined in this
section will be used in making all certified appointments.
   (D)   Probationary period, probationary removal or reduction.
      (1)   All original and promotional appointments including provisional
appointments made pursuant to Ohio R.C. 124.30, shall be for a probationary
period of not less than 60 days nor more than one year except original
appointments to a Police Department as a police officer and
originalappointments to a Fire Department as a firefighter which shall be for a
probationary period of one year. No appointment or promotion is final until the
appointee has satisfactorily served his or her probationary period. The
probationary period of various classifications or positions in the service of
the city is hereby fixed by the Commission under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
124.27 as follows: One hundred twenty calendar days for all classifications
except as otherwise provided or granted by the Commission. An appointing
authority may request, upon a showing of good cause, that the Commission
establish a different probationary period for a specific classification.
      (2)   Service as a provisional employee in the same or similar
classification shall be included in the probationary period. If the service of
the probationary employee is unsatisfactory, he or she may be removed or
reduced at any time during his or her probationary period. If the appointing
authority's decision is to remove or reduce the appointee, his or her
communication to the Commission shall state the reason for such decision. Any
person appointed to a position in the classified service, except temporary and
exceptional appointments, shall be or become forthwith a resident of the state.
   (E)   Restriction as to age, physical or other requirement.  Any restriction
for appointment from an eligible list as to age, physical or other requirements
shall be made prior to and stated in the bulletin announcing the examination
and no eligible list shall be restricted unless is has been announced in the
examination bulletin.
   (F)   Provisional appointments.
      (1)   Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a vacancy in any
position in the classified service and the Commission is unable to certify to
the appointing authority, upon request by the latter, a list of persons
eligible for appointment to such position after a competitive examination, the
appointing authority may nominate a person to the Commission for non-
competitive examination. If such nominee is certified by the Commission as
qualified after such non-competitive examination, he or she may be appointed
provisionally to fill such vacancy until a selection and appointment can be
made after competitive examination. Such provisional appointment shall continue
in force only until a regular appointment can be made from eligible lists
prepared by the Commission and the eligible list shall be prepared within six
months, provided that an examination for the position must be held within said
six-month period from the date of such provisional appointment.
      (2)   Any city employee who is appointed provisionally to fill a vacancy
and who remains in provisional status in the same classification or
classification series for a period of two years of continuous service, during
which period no competitive examination is held, becomes a permanent appointee
in the classified service at the conclusion of such two-year period.
   (G)   Temporary appointments.
      (1)   In case of an emergency, an appointment may be made without regard
to the Civil Service Laws or the Rules of the Commission, but in no case to
continue longer than 30 days, and in no case shall successive appointments be
made. Interim or temporary appointments, made necessary by reason of sickness,
disability or other approved leave of absence of the regular employee shall
continue only during such period of sickness, disability or other approved
leave of absence, subject to rules to be provided for by the Commission.
      (2)   Where the services to be rendered by an appointee are for a
temporary period, not to exceed six months, and the need for such service is
important and urgent, the appointing authority may select, for temporary
service, any person on the proper list of those eligible for permanent
appointment. Successive temporary appointments to the same position shall not
be made under this provision.
      (3)   The acceptance or refusal of a temporary appointment by an eligible
shall not affecthis or her standing on the eligible list for permanent
appointment nor shall the period of temporary service be counted as part of the
probationary service in case of subsequent appointment to a permanent position.
      (4)   All temporary appointments shall be promptly reported to the
Commission by the appointing authority.
   (H)   Exceptional appointments. In case of a vacancy in a position in the
classified service where peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a
scientific, managerial, professional, or educational character are required,
and upon satisfactory evidence that for specified reasons competition in such
special case is impractical and that the position can best be filled by a
selection of some designated person of high and recognized attainments in such
qualities, the Commission may suspend the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.01 to
124.64 requiring competition in such case, suspension of these rules shall be
general in its application and all such cases of suspension shall be reported
in the minutes of the Commission and in the annual report with the reasons for
the suspension.
   (I)   Interim, temporary and intermittent appointments. Persons who receive
external interim, temporary, or intermittent appointments are in the
unclassified service and shall serve at the pleasure of their appointing
authority. Interim appointments shall be made only to fill a vacancy that
results from an employee's temporary absence, but shall not be made to fill a
vacancy that results because an employee receives an interim appointment.
   (J)   Promotions.
      (1)   Vacancies in positions in the classified service shall be filled,
insofar as practicable, by promotions. Promotional appointments shall be made
in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.27 and 124.31 with the
exception of those of patrol officer in the Police Department and of
firefighter in the Fire Department. Promotion of patrol officer shall be made
in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.44 and the promotion of
firefighter shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.45
unless made pursuant to another provision of these rules.
      (2)   In all cases where vacancies are to be filled by promotion, the
Commission shall certify to the appointing authority only the names of the
three persons having the highest rating.
   (K)   Original appointments to the Police and Fire Departments. All original
appointments to the Police Department or to the Fire Department shall be made
in accordance with Ohio R.C. 124.31, 124.41, 124.42 and 124.43 and these rules.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.14 UNCLASSIFIED SERVICE.
   (A)   General. The classified service shall comprise all persons in the
employ of the city, City Health District and City School District not
specifically included in the unclassified service. The unclassified service
includes positions exempted by operation of law, by express voluntary agreement
of the parties and by the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.11(A). Unless a position
is exempted by operation of law all exemptions must be requested from the Civil
Service Commission, as required in this procedure. The Civil Service Commission
will respond in writing and approve or disapprove any request for exemptions
after receipt of the appointing authority's request.
   (B)   Requesting exemptions. The appointing authority may request exemptions
under Ohio R.C. 124.11(A), in accordance with the rules prescribed by the
Commission. The request for exemptions must contain: copies of position
descriptions which reflect the actual duties of the positions for which the
exemption is requested; a current table of organization which shows the
relationship of all positions affected; and, a justification as to what allows
the position to be exempt.
   (C)   Time limits for claiming exemptions; clerical and administrative
support.
      (1)   Within 90 days of taking office, each elective officer or
appointing authority having the power of appointment to, or removal from,
positions in any office, shall designate to the Commission the positions for
which exemption from the competitive classified service is claimed under the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.11(A)(8). Thereafter, no change in the designation
of exemptions claimed under this provision shall be made during the incumbency
of such elective officer or appointing authority unless agency reorganization
occurs as a result of legislative action during the term of office.
      (2)   If exemptions have not been designated by the elected official or
appointing authority within 90 days after taking office, the exemptions
previously designated and in effect under this provision shall be considered
the exemptions claimed by such official or appointing authority and will
continue to be in effect.
      (3)   Other exemptions requested under Ohio R.C. 124.11(A) may be claimed
at any time which is convenient to the appointing authority. This includes the
fiduciary or administrative exemptions under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.11
(A)(28).
   (D)   Appointing authority actions. Once positions have been exempted from
the classified civil service by the Civil Service Commission, the appointing
authority may exercise certain prerogatives, as follows:
      (1)   The appointing authority may allow a classified employee to serve
in an unclassified position;
      (2)   The appointing authority may request that the employee voluntarily
waive his or her classified civil service status, in writing, and accept an
unclassified appointment;
      (3)   The appointing authority may treat the classified position as
abolished and displace the classified employee from the position, as provided
in these rules; or
      (4)   The appointing authority may remove an unclassified employee,
without cause.
   (E)   Displacement of employees upon exemption. Whenever an appointing
authority desires to displace an employee from a position which is newly
exempted by the Civil Service Commission, the appointing authority may proceed
under one of the following options:
      (1)   The appointing authority may move the employee from the exempted
position to a vacant position which has the same classification designation;
      (2)   The appointing authority may treat the position as if it were
abolished and proceed under the available layoff provisions.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.15 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   In addition to probationary period evaluations, performance
evaluations relative to the conduct and capacity of all employees in the
classified service may be made once each year by the appointing authority.
Performance evaluations shall be used as a tool of communication, supervision
and training. The Commission, in conjunction with the City Administration,
shall prescribe the manner and forms of evaluation.
      (2)   When evaluation reports have been marked, reviewed, and signed, a
copy shall be furnished to the employee, a copy may be retained in the
employee's department, and the original shall be forwarded to the employee's
personnel file. A copy of the evaluation will be filed with the Commission.
   (B)   Purpose.
      (1)   Promotional opportunities shall be dependent upon an employee
maintaining satisfactory standards of efficiency and performance.
      (2)   Employees with a performance rating of less than satisfactory for
the year immediately preceding their step increment date shall not be eligible
for a step increase until a satisfactory service rating is attained in either
an annual or special evaluation.
      (3)   Candidates for promotional examinations are required to have a
satisfactory performance rating average for the year immediately preceding the
examination.
      (4)   Any case of the failure of a classified employee to perform his or
her duties in a satisfactory manner may be cause for disciplinary action. The
performance evaluation may be utilized in demonstrating an employee's
unsatisfactory performance.
      (5)   In the event an employee competing for a promotional position does
not have a performance evaluation in the year preceding the closing date for
the promotional exam, the employee will be given full credit for efficiency on
the promotional examination.
   (C)   Content of performance evaluations. The evaluation system shall
incorporate the objectives of a performance evaluation, direct who is to
complete evaluations and who is to be evaluated, indicate when evaluations are
to be conducted, establish categories of performance evaluations which shall
indicate the areas of performance to be evaluated, establish the guidelines for
the categories of evaluation, and prescribe the forms for performance
evaluations.
   (D)   Conduct of performance evaluation. Each employee shall be evaluated by
his or her immediate supervisor or as otherwise established by the appointing
authority. If an employee has been reassigned to a new supervisor within the
month preceding the date an evaluation is conducted, the new supervisor shall
consult, where possible, with the previous supervisor in conducting the
evaluation.
   (E)   Review by employee. Each employee shall be given the opportunity to
review his or her evaluation prior to the time the evaluation is made a part of
the employee's permanent personnel file. Upon review of the evaluation, the
employee shall be required to acknowledge that he or she has reviewed the
evaluation. Alterations made to an evaluation after the time the employee has
reviewed his or her evaluation may only be made with notice to the employee or
as a result of the appeal process.
   (F)   Appeal of performance evaluation by the employee.
      (1)   Any permanent employee who receives a below average performance
evaluation shall have the right to appeal the rating to the Commission. The
Commission must receive the appeal within ten days of the receipt of the review
of the evaluation. The request for review shall set forth supporting facts and
evidence that the rating was not accurate.
      (2)   Upon submission of a request for appeal of performance evaluations
the Safety or Service Director, whichever is appropriate, shall submit a
response to the request which response shall address the issues and allegations
contained in the review request.
      (3)   The Commission shall investigate and conduct the review as it deems
most appropriate. The Commission shall make a determination and may order:
         (a)   That the evaluation remain unaltered;
         (b)   That individual ratings be raised or lowered; or
         (c)   Any other appropriate remedy.
      (4)   The Commission shall not alter performance evaluations unless the
employee establishes by a preponderance of the evidence:
         (a)   That the rater or other person abused his or her discretion,
producing an inaccurate, unfair, or prejudicial evaluation;
         (b)   That the evaluation was determined arbitrary or totally without
regard to the employee's actual performance; or
         (c)   That the employee's supervisor or other responsible person
failed to substantially comply with the procedures established in completing or
reviewing the evaluation.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.16 TRANSFERS, REASSIGNMENTS, REINSTATEMENTS AND LEAVES.
   (A)   Transfers, reassignments and reinstatements.
      (1)   With the consent of the Commission, a person holding an office or
position in the classified service may be transferred to a similar position in
another office or department having the same pay and similar duties; but no
transfer shall be made from an office or position in one classification to an
office or position in another classification. Nor shall a person be transferred
to an office or position for original entrance to which there is required by
civil service law, or the rules of this Commission, an examination involving
essential tests or qualifications or carrying a salary different from, or
higher than, those required for original entrance to an office or position held
by such person.
      (2)   An employee shall not be reduced by reassignment except upon
request of the employee and approval by the Commission. An employee is reduced
if reassigned to a classification assigned a lower pay range. An employee
returning to his or her regular position from a temporary work level will not
be considered to be reassigned, reduced or reclassified.
      (3)   Inter-departmental transfers and reassignments. Any employee in the
classified service who has served the required probationary term, may be
transferred or reassigned from a position in one department to a position of
the same classification in another department. Where the good of the service
demands, transfers may be made. Nothing herein shall be construed to interfere
with the right of the city to assign or reassign employees within a given
classification among the various departments as necessary in the best interests
of the service.
      (4)   Temporary assignment to other work. Any employee in the classified
service may be assigned to work other than that described in the specifications
of his or her classification, but of the same general level of responsibility,
for a period not exceeding 30 days. Such an assignment shall not involve a
decrease in compensation. No person shall be reassigned for more than 30 days
at a time on other duties than those implied by his or her classification title
unless he or she has qualified through competitive examination and is appointed
in accordance with the procedure in these rules.
   (B)   Reinstatement after separation. Any person holding an office or
position under the classified service who has been separated from the service
without delinquency or misconduct on his or her part may, at the discretion of
the appointing authority and with consent of the Commission, be reinstated
within one year from the date of such separation to a vacancy in the same or
similar office or position in the same department.
   (C)   Leave of absence. The appointing authority may grant leave of absence
to an employee in the classified service for a period not to exceed one year.
All such leaves of absence granted by appointing authorities shall be referred
to the Commission in order that the civil service status of such absentees may
be protected. All leaves of absence shall be according to the policies
established by the appointing authority. If it is found that a leave is not
actually being used for the purpose for which it was granted, the appointing
authority or the Commission may cancel the leave and direct the employee to
report for work by giving written notice to the employee.
   (D)   Absence without leave.
      (1)   Any employee in the classified service who absents himself or
herself from duty habitually for three or more successive duty days, without
leave,and without adequate advance notice to his or her supervisor of the
reasons for such absence, may be subject to discipline, up to and including
removal, for neglect of duty. This rule does not require an appointing
authority to initiate removal action if he or she determines it unwarranted nor
does it preclude removal action for a shorter period of absence if the absence
is of sufficient seriousness.
      (2)   Failure to report after a leave has expired or has been disapproved
or revoked and canceled by the appointing authority or the Commission for cause
shown shall be considered neglect of duty and cause for discharge; provided,
however, that if the employee so discharged shows to the satisfaction of the
appointing authority and/or the Commission that the failure to report was
excusable, the employee may be reinstated.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.17 LAYOFFS.
   (A)   Layoff procedure. Whenever it becomes necessary for an appointing
authority to reduce its work force in any department except police and fire,
the appointing authority shall lay off employees or abolish their positions in
accordance with civil service law and the rules of this Commission. Employees
may be laid off as a result of lack of funds, lack of work or abolishment of
positions.
   (B)   Order of layoff. Whenever a reduction in force is necessary within
each of the primary appointment categories, first seasonal, then part-time
permanent and then full-time permanent employees shall be laid off in the
following order:
      (1)   Employees serving provisionally who have not completed their
probationary period after appointment;
      (2)   Employees serving provisionally who have satisfactorily completed
their probationary period afer appointment;
      (3)   Employees appointed from certified eligible lists or who are
certified and who have not completed their probationary period after
appointment;
      (4)   Employees appointed from certified eligible lists or who are
certified and who have satisfactorily completed their probationary period after
appointment.
   (C)   Retention points.
      (1)   Retention points to reflect systematic consideration of seniority
and relative efficiency for all employees will be assigned by the Commission.
Credit for relative efficiency may be less than but shall not exceed ten
percent of total retention points.
      (2)   Retention points will be determined as follows:
         (a)   Employees shall be assigned one seniority point for each
completed 520 hours (excluding overtime hours) of continuous service or 13 full
weeks of service for a full-time employee. These seniority points shall be
added to a base factor of 100 points, this yielding total seniority points.
         (b)   Using the chart below, employees shall be assigned efficiency
points by: averaging the latest two annual performance evaluations; or using
the latest performance evaluation, if less than two years of service; or using
the latest probationary performance evaluation, if less than one year of
service. Employees who have not been currently evaluated shall be given the
maximum number of efficiency points. In no event shall a special performance
evaluation be conducted or used for purposes of computing efficiency points.
Total Score on Performance Evaluation Efficiency Points
20 and below                          0
21 - 28                               1
29 - 36                               2
37 - 44                               3
45 - 52                               4
53 - 60                               5
61 - 68                               6
69 - 76                               7
77 - 84                               8
85 - 92                               9
93 - 100                              10
 
      (3)   The total seniority points plus the total efficiency points equals
the total retention points. In cases of identical retention points ratings,
those employees having least seniority in terms of actual date of hire will be
laid off first.
   (D)   Displacement rights.
      (1)   A laid-off employee in the classified service has the right to
displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the classification
from which the employee was laid off or in a lower or equivalent
classification, in the following order:
         (a)   Within the classification from which the employee was laid off;
         (b)   Within the classification series from which the employee was
laid off;
         (c)   Within a classification which, according to Commission Rules,
has the same or similar duties as the classification from which the employee
was laid off; and,
         (d)   Within the classification the employee held immediately prior to
holding the classification from which the employee was laid off if the laid-off
employee was certified in the former classification and if the employee held
the classification less than five years prior to the date on which the employee
was laid off.
      (2)   A laid off employee may not displace another employee if the laid
off employee does not meet the minimum qualifications of the classification.
      (3)   Any employee displaced by an employee possessing more retention
points shall displace the employee with the fewest retention points in the next
lower classification or successively lower classification in the same
classification series; except that a displaced provisional employee shall not
displace a certified employee. This process shall continue, if necessary, until
the employee with the fewest retention points in the lowest classification of
the classification series of the same appointing authority or independent
institution has been reached and, if necessary, laid off.
   (E)   Notification of layoff, displacement and recall.
      (1)   Each employee to be laid off shall be given advance written notice
of the layoff by the appointing authority. Such written notice shall be hand-
delivered to the employee at work or mailed certified mail to the last address
on file with the appointing authority. If hand-delivered such notice shall be
given 14 calendar days, before layoff and the day of hand-delivery shall be the
first day of the 14 day period. If mailed, such notice shall be given 17
calendar days before layoff and the day of posting shall be the first day of
the 17th day period.
      (2)   Each notice of layoff or displacement should contain the following
information:
         (a)   The reason for layoff or displacement;
         (b)   The effective date of the layoff or displacement became
effective;
         (c)   The employee's retention points;
         (d)   The right of such employee to appeal to the Commission and the
time within which to file an appeal;
         (e)   If the employee has the opportunity to displace, a statement
advising the employee of the right to displace another employee and the length
of time within which the employee may displace (bump) another employee;
         (f)   A statement advising the employee of the right to reinstatement
or re-employment;
         (g)   A statement that, upon request by the employee, the appointing
authority will make available a copy of rules regarding layoffs.
         (h)   A statement that the employee is responsible for maintaining a
current address with his or her appointing authority.
      (3)   A notice which deviates from the above list may be viewed by the
Commission to determine substantial compliance and/or harm to the employee.
   (F)   Reinstatement from layoff.
      (1)   An employee who is laid off retains reinstatement rights in the
agency from which he or she was laid off. Reinstatement rights continue for one
year from the date of layoff. During this one-year period, in any layoff
jurisdiction in which an appointing authority has an employee on a layoff list,
the appointing authority shall not hire or promote anyone into that
classification until all laid-off persons on a layoff list for that
classification are reinstated or decline the position when it is offered.
      (2)   Each employee recalled from layoff shall be notified of the offer
of reinstatement or re-employment by certified letter. The notice of re-
employment shall contain a statement that refusal of re-employment shall result
in removal of such employee's name from the jurisdictional layoff list. Each
recalled employee shall be allowed ten calendar days from the date of receipt
of the letter to return to work, and such time limit shall be explained to the
employee in the notification of recall letter.
      (3)   In the event of extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, injury,
or other good cause as determined by the Commission) preventing the employee
from returning within the above time limit, the employer shall grant a
reasonable extension, not to exceed 60 days. In the absence of extenuating
circumstances, an employee not accepting or declining reinstatement or re-
employment within ten days shall be deemed to have declined reinstatement or
re-employment for purposes of removal under these rules.
   (G)   Appeal of layoff or reduction. A classified employee may appeal a
layoff, or a displacement which is the result of a layoff to the Commission.
The appeal shall be filed or post-marked no later than ten days after receipt
of the notice of layoff or after the date the employee is displaced.
   (H)   Establishment of layoff lists. Employees who have been laid off or who
have, by virtue of exercising their displacement rights, been displaced to a
lower classification in their classification series, shall be placed on
appropriate layoff lists. Those employees with the most retention points shall
be placed at the top of the layoff list to be followed by employees ranked in
descending total retention order. Laid-off employees shall be placed on layoff
lists for each classification in the classification series equal to or lower
than the classification in which the employee was employed at the time of
layoff.
   (I)   Layoffs or reductions in the Police and Fire Departments. Whenever it
becomes necessary in the Police and Fire Departments, through lack of work or
funds, or for causes other than those outlined in Ohio R.C. 124.34, to reduce
the force in those departments, such changes shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of Ohio R.C. 124.37 and the provisions of these rules.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.18 REDUCTIONS, SUSPENSIONS AND REMOVALS.
   (A)   Pre-disciplinary meeting.
      (1)   Prior to a reduction in pay or position, fine in excess of five
days' pay, suspension of more than three days, or removal of a classified
employee, the appointing authority shall hold a pre-disciplinary meeting to
address the allegations of misconduct. The classified employee shall be given
advance notice of the meeting and may request a short extension of time. No
pre-disciplinary meeting will be delayed more than 24 hours to enable the
employee's representative to attend.
      (2)   At the meeting, the employee shall have the opportunity to respond
to the disciplinary charges. The employee may: appear at the meeting to present
an oral or written statement in response to the charges; appear at the meeting
and have his or her chosen representative present an oral or written statement
in response to the charges; or, elect to waive his or her opportunity to have a
pre-disciplinary meeting. The employee does not have the right to call or
cross-examine witnesses.
   (B)   Discipline - general.
      (1)   The tenure of every employee in the classified service of the city
shall be during good behavior and efficient service and no employee shall be
reduced in pay or position, fined in excess of five days' pay, suspended for
more than three days, or removed except as provided in Ohio R.C. 124.32, and
for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, drunkenness, immoral conduct,
insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect of duty,
violation of the rules of the Commission, or any other failure of good
behavior, or any other acts of misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in
office, or conviction of a felony. The city may require an employee who is
suspended to report to work to serve the suspension. An employee serving a
suspension in this manner shall continue to be compensated at the employee's
regular rate of pay for hours worked. Such disciplinary action shall be
recorded in the employee's personnel file in the same manner as other
disciplinary actions and has the same effect as a suspension without pay for
the purpose of recording disciplinary actions. A finding by the appropriate
Ethics Commission, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the facts
alleged in a complaint under Ohio R.C. 102.06 constitute a violation of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 102. Ohio R.C. 2921.42 or 2921.43 may constitute grounds for
dismissal. Failure to file a statement or falsely filing a statement required
by Ohio R.C. 102.02 may also constitute grounds for dismissal.
      (2)   Conviction of a felony is a separate basis for reducing in pay or
position, suspending, or removing an officer or employee even if the officer or
employee has already been reduced in pay or position, suspended, or removed for
the same conduct that is the basis of the felony. An officer or employee may
not appeal to the Commission any disciplinary action taken by the City as a
result of the of the officer's or employee's conviction of a felony. If an
officer or employee removed under this section is reinstated as a result of an
appeal of the removal, any conviction of a felony that occurs during the
pendency of the appeal is a basis for further disciplinary action upon the
officer's or employee's reinstatement.
      (3)   A person convicted of a felony immediately forfeits the person's
status as a classified employee in any public employment on and after the date
of conviction for the felony. If an officer or employee is removed as a result
of being convicted of a felony or is subsequently convicted of a felony that
involves the same conduct that was the basis for the removal, the office or
employee is barred from receiving any compensation after the removal
notwithstanding any modification or disaffirmance of the removal, unless the
conviction for the felony is subsequently reversed or annulled.
      (4)   Any person removed for conviction of a felony is entitled to a cash
payment for any accrued but unused sick, personal, and vacation leave as
authorized by these rules.
      (5)   As used in this rule, felony means any of the following:
         (a)   A felony that is an offense of violence as defined in Ohio R.C.
2901.01;
         (b)   A felony that is a felony drug abuse offense as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01;
         (c)   A felony under the laws of this or any other state or the United
States that is a crime of moral turpitude;
         (d)   A felony involving dishonesty, fraud or theft;
         (e)   A felony that is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2921.05, 2921.32, or
2921.42.
      (6)   In any case of a reduction, suspension for more than three working
days, or fine in excess of three days' pay, or a removal, the appointing
authority shall furnish such employee with a copy of the order of reduction,
fine, suspension or removal, which order shall state the reasons therefore. The
order shall be filed with the Commission.
      (7)   Within ten days following the date on which such order is served,
the employee may file an appeal, in writing, with the Commission. For purposes
of this rule, the date on which an order is served is the date of hand delivery
of the order or the date of delivery of the order by certified United States
mail, whichever occurs first. In the event an appeal is filed, the Commission
shall forthwith notify the appointing authority, and shall hear, or appoint a
trial board to hear, the appeal within thirty days from and after its filing
with the Commission. The Commission may affirm, disaffirm, or modify the
judgment of the appointing authority.
      (8)   In cases of removal or reduction in pay for disciplinary reasons,
either the appointing authority or the officer employee may appeal from the
decision of the Commission to the Court of Common Pleas of the County in which
the employee resides in accordance with the procedure provided by Ohio R.C.
119.12.
   (C)   Chiefs of Police and Fire Departments.
      (1)   The Mayor has the exclusive right to suspend the Chief of the
Police Department or the Chief of the Fire Department for incompetence, gross
neglect of duty, gross immorality, habitual drunkenness, failure to obey orders
given him or her by the proper authority, or for any other reasonable and just
cause. If either the Chief of Police or the Chief of the Fire Department is so
suspended, the Mayor forthwith shall certify such fact, together with the cause
of suspension, to the Commission, which within five days from the date of
receipt of the notice shall proceed to hear such charges and render judgment
thereon, which judgment may affirm, disaffirm, or modify the judgment of the
Mayor. An appeal may be had from the decision of the Commission to the Court of
Common Pleas as provided in the Ohio Revised Code to determine the sufficiency
of the cause of removal.
      (2)   In the case of suspension for any period of time, or a fine,
demotion, or removal of a Chief of Police or a Chief of a Fire Department or
any member of the Police or Fire Department, the appointing authority shall
furnish such Chief or member with a copy of the order of suspension, demotion,
or removal, which order shall state the reasons therefore. Such order shall be
filed with the Commission. Within ten days following the filing of such order,
such Chief or member of the department may file an appeal, in writing, with the
Commission. If such an appeal is filed the Commission shall forthwith notify
the appointing authority and shall hear, or appoint a trial board to hear, such
appeal within 30 days from and after its filing with the Commission and it may
affirm, disaffirm, or modify the judgment of the appointing authority. An
appeal may be had from the decision of the Commission to the Court of Common
Pleas in the county in which the city is situated. Such appeal shall be taken
within 30 days from the finding of the Commission.
   (D)   Disciplinary suspension. An employee may be suspended for a period not
to exceed three working days for purposes of discipline without a pre-
disciplinary meeting and without the right of appeal, except in the case of a
Police Chief, Fire Chief or member of the Police or Fire Departments as
described above.
   (E)   Falsification in application. Falsification of any statement in an
application for examination shall be considered "dishonesty" and sufficient
cause for discipline including removal.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.19 DISABILITY SEPARATION.
   (A)   Voluntary disability separation.
      (1)   An employee who is unable to perform the essential job duties of
his or her position due to a disabling illness, injury or condition may request
a voluntary disability separation. A voluntary disability separation occurs
when an employee does not dispute his or her inability to perform the essential
job duties of his or her position due to disabling illness, injury or
condition.
      (2)   Prior to approving an employee's request for a voluntary disability
separation, the appointing authority may require the employee to submit to a
medical or psychological examination. An employee who is granted a voluntary
disability separation waives his or her right to a pre-separation hearing and
to an appeal of the decision.
      (3)   An employee who is granted a voluntary disability separation shall
retain the right to be reinstated to his or her position for three years from
the date the employee is no longer in active work status due to a disabling
illness, injury or condition.
   (B)   Involuntary disability separation.
      (1)   An appointing authority, with the approval of the Commission, may
require an employee to submit to a medical or psychological examination. An
appointing authority shall request that an employee submit to a medical or
psychological examination, conducted in accordance with civil service law,
prior to involuntarily separating the employee unless: the employee is
hospitalized at the time the action is to be taken; or, the employee has
exhausted his or her disability leave benefits.
      (2)   When an appointing authority has received the results of a medical
or psychological examination and initially determines that an employee is
incapable of performing the essential job duties of the employee's assigned
position due to a disabling illness, injury or condition, the appointing
authority shall institute pre-separation proceedings. Under those proceedings,
a hearing shall be scheduled and advance written notice of at least 72 hours
shall be provided.
      (3)   If the appointing authority determines, after weighing the
testimony presented and the evidence admitted at the pre-separation hearing,
that the employee is unable to perform his or her essential job duties, then
the appointing authority shall issue, and file with the Commission, an
involuntary disability separation order. An employee so separated shall have
the right to appeal in writing to the Commission within ten days following the
filing of the order with the Commission.
(Ord. 2001-03, passed 1-16-01)
§ 270.20 POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
   (A)   General. No officer or employee in the classified service of the city,
City Health District or City School District shall directly or indirectly,
orally or by letter, solicit or receive, or be in any manner concerned in
soliciting or receiving any assessment, subscription or contribution for any
political party or for any candidate for public office; nor shall any person

(`82 Code, § 280.02) (Ord. 90-31, passed 4-3-90)
§ 280.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates § 280.02(D) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree
and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than six months,

(`82 Code, § 280.99) (Ord. 90-31, passed 4-3-90)
Editor's note:
   Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and
determine any prosecution for the violation of a city ordinance, and has
jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations
occurring on state highways located within the corporate limits of city,
subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or
her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws pertaining to
county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Hamilton County and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all
papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to
date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23
(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense
cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by
the court unless he or she demands a jury trial. But the jurisdiction of a
Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic
Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a
Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not
directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he or she is not the
chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such
responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
Clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the Clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any state statute or of any city
ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed a fine
of $100.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayors' Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or §434.01 of the Traffic Code, in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

§ 414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (A)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (B)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (C)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to astop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (C)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (D)   Flashing green signal indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (E)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (B)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right- hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         (a)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         (b)   When preparing for a left turn;
         (c)   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

be assessed for a violation of division (A) of this section in accordance with

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.

in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two- hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate,
an emergency medical technician- paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist,
or phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining
the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance,
or combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (D)(1)(b) shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         (c)   As used in division (D)(1)(b) of this section, EMERGENCY MEDICAL

      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) of this
section or for an equivalent offense, if there was at the time the bodily
substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the applicable
concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)(c), (A)(1)(d)
and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable concentration of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this section, that fact may
be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or
innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under § 434.015, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission
of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a
law enforcement officer.

operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital,
first-aid station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant
to this section, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability based

   (A)   (1)   (a)   ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE means any device that provides
for continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any
immobilizing or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that
is constantly available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s
system, or any other device that provides for the automatic testing and
periodic reporting of alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a
person to use as a sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of
or plea of guilty to an offense.
         (b)   COMMUNITY ADDICTION SERVICES PROVIDER has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 5119.01.
         (c)   PHYSICAL CONTROL has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of
abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
oral fluid, or urine if arrested for a violation of §
434.01(A), (B), or (N), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (A)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle, streetcar, or trackless trolley in violation of a division,
section, or ordinance identified in division (A)(2) of this section. The law
enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate which of
the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (C) of this section, but the
officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person
refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable
means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise
the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of
this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant
to this division. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply to the
administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to
any person under arrest for a violation of §
434.01(A), (B) or (N), Ohio R.C.4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C.4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (C) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.
   “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section to submit to a chemical
test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer
shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in which the
arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in
possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the person’s
vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section,
if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
434.01(N), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. Ohio
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
434.01(N), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
who is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C. 4511.197 relative to
any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the

person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that
resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests
under division (A)(1) through (A)(5) of this section does not affect the
suspension.
   (I)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
434.01(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §

ordinance, regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C) or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s
initial appearance on the charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within
five days of the persons’ arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her,

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.

suspension of the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C.

offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.

the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

time of the alleged violation of division (B)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (B)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section is guilty of

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))

section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator

has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.

§ 4511.01 or a vehicle that is regulated under R.C. § 5104.015, that is
required by the United States Department of Transportation to be equipped with
seat belts at the time of manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor
vehicle shall have the child properly secured in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions on a booster seat that meets federal motor vehicle

15 years of age, and who is not otherwise required by division (a), (b), or (c)
of this section to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in R.C. § 4513.263.
   (E)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(C) or (D) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose
of determining whether a violation of division (C) or (D) of this section has
been or is being committed.
   (F)   The Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are necessary
to carry out this section.
   (G)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or in an occupant restraining device as
required in this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the

the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section. This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
state under R.C. Chapter 4731, a clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse
practitioner licensed to practice in this state under R.C. Chapter 4723, or a
chiropractor licensed to practice in this state under R.C. Chapter 4734 that
states that the child who otherwise would be required to be restrained under
this section has a physical impairment that makes use of a child restraint
system, booster seat, or an occupant restraining device impossible or
impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has safely and
appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any recommendations of
the physician, nurse, or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (I)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (J)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this section
shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat or occupant restraining device as required by this section that
occurred at the same time, on the same day and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section:
         (a)   Except as otherwise provided in division (J)(1)(b) of this
section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than $25 nor more than $75.
         (b)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (C)(3) or (C)(4) of this section is immune from civil

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non- economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available
elements of such a device, or was not wearing such a device as properly
adjusted is admissible in evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a
tort action to the extent that the claim for relief satisfies all of the
following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (G)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section shall be fined
$30.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (B)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section

division (B)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (B)(4) of this

§ 440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (A)   State regulations.
      (1)   (a)   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         (b)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate
or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or
load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or
otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any
highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   (a)   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Ohio Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may
move the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any
highway that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly
within and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local
authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee
or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         (b)   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be
issued for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in
its discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public
construction project.
      (3)   (a)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         (b)   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         (c)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (A)(1)(a) of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (A)(1)(b) of this section. If a permit is to be issued,
the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a condition of
issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   (a)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         (b)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         (c)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (B)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC4513.99)
   (C)   Local streets. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no person
shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as specified in §
440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any street in the
municipality other than state routes and county roads, except those local
streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by appropriate traffic
signs, and except when such operation is necessary to load or unload property,

ice upon some or all of the streets and highways of the city, resulting in the
declaration of a snow emergency, then the snow emergency shall remain in effect
until such snow emergency is taken out of effect by either the Mayor or Safety
Service Director of the city. However, when any street, subject to this

edge, as is determined by the Mayor of the city, the Safety Service Director or
their designate, then the street may be removed from the emergency restrictions
of this chapter.

until such emergency has terminated, no person shall operate a motor vehicle on
any snow emergency route in such a manner as to allow or permit the vehicle to
become stalled on such route, either by reason of the fact that the vehicle is
not a four wheel drive vehicle or such vehicle is not equipped with tire
chains, studded snow tires, or other tires which provide effective traction, or
by reason of the fact that the motor vehicle fuel supply has been allowed to
become exhausted.

search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (F)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
         (b)   For purposes of this division (B)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         (c)   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of

vehicles on streets, highways, public property, or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (B) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing

(ORC 2901.01, 2921.01) (‘82 Code, § 606.01)
§ 606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

§ 606.03 CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.

   (B)   Regardless of the penalty that may be imposed, any offense
specifically classified as a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Any offense not specifically classified is a misdemeanor if
imprisonment for not more than one year may be imposed as a penalty.
   (D)   Any offense not specifically classified is a minor misdemeanor if the
only penalty that may be imposed is one of the following:
      (1)   For an offense committed prior to January 1, 2004, a fine not
exceeding $100;
      (2)   For an offense committed on or after January 1, 2004, a fine not

      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that

§ 606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined
in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.

§ 606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his or her office or employment, except that if the section defining the
offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the
organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable,
such provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of his or her office or employment, except that if the section defining
the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for whose conduct the
organization is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable,
such provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of his or her office or employment.
   (B)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust, or other commercial or legal entity.
ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program.

   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.

   (B)   No person, in connection with the purchase of a firearm as defined in

offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.

initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (J)(3)(b)
of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
      (3)   (a)   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.
         (b)   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration

jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (K). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an

designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (E) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (K), or on
appeal as described in this division (K), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (E) to (J) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
618.25 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (F)(1) in an amount described
in division (L)(5)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (K), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the

of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the

notified the Police Department that a minor was present on the premises of the

   (D)   Parental responsibilities. No parent or guardian having legal custody
shall knowingly permit or by inefficient control allow such minor to be in or
on public streets or public places under circumstances not constituting an
exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope of, this section. The term
KNOWINGLY includes knowledge which a parent or guardian should reasonably be
expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parent's or
guardian's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall be no defense that a parent
was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such
minor.
   (E)   Police procedures.
      (1)   A police officer of the city, upon finding or having attention
called to any minor on the streets in prima-facie violation of this section,
normally shall take the minor to the City Police Station, where a parent or
guardian shall immediately be notified to come for the minor, and whereupon an
inquiry shall be made. This inquiry is intended to permit the officer to
ascertain, under constitutional safeguards, relevant facts and information to
perform his duties. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth
certificate, a police officer on the street shall, in the first instance, use
his best judgment in determining age.
      (2)   A police officer may, under appropriate circumstances, order such
minor to return home or may deliver the minor to the custody of the parent or
guardian, where, for example, such minor is of tender age, or where the
identity and address of such minor may readily be ascertained.
      (3)   When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take
charge of the minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the
minor shall be released to the custody of such parent or guardian. If the
parent or guardian cannot be located, or fails to take charge of the minor,
then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the
extent that, in accordance with police regulations, the minor may temporarily
be intrusted to a relative, neighbor, or other person who will, on behalf of a
parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the
availability or arrival of a parent of guardian.
      (4)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall send to a parent or guardian written notice of the violation with a
warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
section, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
   (F)   Non-limiting. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as
restricting the City Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in
the arrest, apprehension, detention and prosecution of individuals found to be
in violation of non-curfew laws, statutes or ordinances under the city
municipal code, state and federal laws.
   (G)   Penalties.
      (1)   If, after a parent or guardian has been warned and given notice of
a first violation by such minor, and the minor is found in violation again,
this shall be treated as a first offense by the parent or guardian. Such parent
or guardian shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor. For any subsequent offense,
a parent or guardian shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
      (2)   Any minor who shall violate any of the provisions of this section
more than two times shall be reported to the Juvenile Authorities for the
treatment, supervision and rehabilitation of such minor.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (B)(3) of this section shall be guilty of
a minor misdemeanor for the first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree for each subsequent offense.

expelled from school, shall be at any place within the city except in

the times that the minor would have been required to be in attendance at school

   (C)   Operator responsibility. It shall be unlawful for any operator or any
business establishment to knowingly permit a minor to remain at the
establishment under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or
otherwise beyond the scope of, this section. The term “knowingly” includes
knowledge that an operator should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
patrons of the establishment. The standard for “knowingly” shall be applied
through an objective test: whether a reasonable person in the operator's
position should have known that the patron was a minor in violation of this
section.
   (D)   Notice to parent or guardian.
      (1)   A school which suspends or expels a minor child from school shall
notify the parents or guardians of the minor child of the terms of this section
by mailing a copy of this section or the underlying ordinance to the parents or
guardians to their last know address.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall send the parents or guardians of any
minor child violating the terms of this section written notice of the child's
violation.
      (3)   Failure to receive the notices provided for herein is not a defense
to prosecution.

misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $100.

offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,

2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),

than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a

violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (A)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (A)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.

apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      JUNK. Any worn-out, cast-off or discarded article or material which is
ready for destruction or has been collected or stored for salvage or conversion
to some other use. Any article or material which, unaltered or unchanged and
without further reconditioning, can be used for its original purpose as readily
as when new is not considered JUNK.
      RUBBISH. Includes wire, chips, shavings, bottles, broken glass, crockery,
tin, cast or wooden ware, hoses, rags, dead weeds, stumps, tree trunks, brush,
paper circulars, handbills, boots, shoes, ashes, metal, discarded parts and
equipment or any waste material other than garbage or offal.
      (2)   The deposit, storage, maintenance or collection of junk or rubbish
outside a building is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and offensive to
the public health, welfare and safety.
      (3)   (a)   No person in charge or control of any premises in the city,
whether as owner, tenant, lessee, occupant or otherwise, shall allow any junk
or rubbish to remain upon such premises longer than ten days after receipt of
written notice to remove the junk or rubbish from the premises. The written
notice shall be issued by the Chief of Police or his or her designee.
         (b)   Such written notice shall be served upon the person in charge
personally, by leaving the notice at his or her usual place of residence or by
certified mail addressed to his or her last known place of residence. If the
person in charge is a firm or corporation, such written notice may be served
personally upon the persons in charge at the premises, by leaving the notice at
the place of business or by certified mail addressed to the place of business.
         (c)   This section does not apply, however, to the deposit, storage,
maintenance or collection of junk or rubbish in an enclosed building, as
permitted by ordinances of the city, or in any area of the city in which the
same is permitted by ordinances of the city.
   (B)   Junk vehicles.
      (1)   For purposes of this section, JUNK MOTOR VEHICLE means any motor
vehicle which is three years old or older; extensively damaged, such damage
including but not limited to any of the following: missing wheels, tires,
motor, or transmission; apparently inoperable; and having a fair market value
of $3,000 or less, that is left uncovered in the open on private property for
more than 72 hours with the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or
scrap metal processing facility licensed under the authority of Ohio R.C.
4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise regulated under authority of a political
subdivision; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation in which the
owner or occupant has the immediate intention to complete repairs necessary to
make the vehicle operable; or if the motor vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
      (2)   The municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector’s vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector’s vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The Police Chief, the Council, or the zoning authority may send
notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (C)   Unlicensed or wrecked vehicles.
      (1)   No owner or occupant of any property within the city shall permit
an unlicensed or improperly licensed automobile or, if licensed, a wrecked
automobile, when it is reasonably anticipated that the owner or occupant of the
property has no immediate intention to make such automobile operable, or
papers, cans, metal parts, vehicle parts, garbage, offal or other trash, to be
upon any part of any property within the city. The provisions of this section
shall not apply to the lawful storage of garbage and rubbish that is subject to
regular collection by the city.
      (2)   The Safety-Service Director, the Chief of Police or the Chief's
designee shall, by written notice, advise violators of the provisions of
division (C)(1) of this section. Written notice shall provide ten days to
correct the violation and such notice may be hand delivered with personal
service made or be mailed by registered mail. If the owner or other person
having charge of the subject property is a nonresident, delivery of a
registered letter to the last known address shall be sufficient. If the address
of the owner or other person having charge of the subject property is unknown,
it shall be sufficient to publish such notice once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county.
   (D)   Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of division (A) or (B) of
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor for a first offense, a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree for a second offense and a misdemeanor of the
third degree for any subsequent offense.
      (2)   Whoever violates division (C) of this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree for a first offense and a misdemeanor of the
third degree for any subsequent offense.

      (1)   The Superintendent of Schools of the Reading School District may
excuse a child from attendance for any part of the remainder of the current
school year upon a satisfactory showing of either of the following facts:
         (a)   That his or her bodily or mental condition does not permit his
or attendance at school or a special education program during such period. This
fact shall be certified, in writing, by a licensed physician, or, in the case
of a mental condition, by a licensed physician, a licensed psychologist, a
licensed school psychologist or a certificated school psychologist. In
addition, provision shall be made for appropriate instruction of the child, in
accordance with Ohio R.C. Chapter 3323.
         (b)   That he or she is being instructed at home by a person qualified

Superintendent, require. In each such case, the issuing Superintendent shall
file in his or her office, with a copy of the excuse, papers showing how the
inability of the child to attend school or a special education program or the
qualifications of the person instructing the child at home were determined. All
such excuses shall become void and subject to recall upon the removal of the
disability of the child or upon the cessation of proper home instruction.
Thereupon, the child or his or her parents may be proceeded against after due
notice, whether or not such excuse is recalled.
      (2)   The State Board of Education may adopt rules authorizing the
Superintendent of Schools of the Reading School District to excuse a child over
14 years of age from attendance for a future limited period for the purpose of
performing necessary work directly and exclusively for his or her parent or
legal guardian.
      (3)   The Reading Board of Education, or the governing authorities of a
private or parochial school, may, in the rules governing the discipline in such
schools, prescribe the authority by which and the manner in which any child may
be excused for absence from such school for good and sufficient reasons.
   (D)   (1)   All excuses provided for in division (C)(1) and (2) of this
section shall be in writing and shall show the reason for excusing the child. A
copy thereof shall be sent to the person in charge of the child.
      (2)   The State Board of Education may, by rule, prescribe conditions
governing the issuance of excuses, which conditions shall be binding upon the
authorities authorized to issue such excuses.
(‘82 Code, § 662.03) (Ord. 85-49, passed 9-3-85)
§ 662.04 ATTENDANCE AT NONPUBLIC SCHOOLS.
   If any child attends instruction elsewhere than in a public school, such
instruction shall be in a school which conforms to the minimum standards
prescribed by the State Board of Education. The hours and term of attendance
exacted shall be equivalent to the hours and term of attendance required of
children in the Reading School District. This section does not require a child
to attend a high school instead of a vocational, commercial or other special
type of school, provided that the instruction therein is for a term and for
hours equivalent to those of the high school, and provided that his or her
attendance at such school will not interfere with a continuous program of
education for the child to the age of 16.
(‘82 Code, § 662.04) (Ord. 85-49, passed 9-3-85)
§ 662.05 TRUANCY; NOTICE TO PARENT OR GUARDIAN.
   On the request of the Superintendent of Schools or the Reading Board of
Education, or when it otherwise comes to his or her notice, the attendance
officer shall examine any case of supposed truancy within the Reading School
District and shall warn the child, if fund truant, and his or her parent,
guardian or other person in charge of such child, in writing, of the legal
consequences of truancy if it continues. When any child of compulsory school
age, in violation of law, is not attending school, the attendance officer shall
notify the parent, guardian or other person in charge of such child of the fact
and shall require such parent, guardian or other person to cause the child to
attend school forthwith. Such parent, guardian or other person shall cause such
child's attendance at school. Upon the failure of such parent, guardian or
other person to do so, the attendance officer shall make a complaint against
such parent, guardian or other person in any court of competent jurisdiction.

one of the types of licenses, permits or privileges specified in division (D)
(1) of this section or deny the issuance of one of the temporary instruction
permits specified in division (D)(1) of this section, the court in its
discretion may choose not to impose the suspension, revocation or denial

§ 698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DANGEROUS OFFENDER means a person who has committed an offense, whose

repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences.
   REPEAT OFFENDER means a person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or
she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a person is a

defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as

(ORC 2935.36(E)) (‘82 Code, § 698.01)
§ 698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (A)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (A)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (A)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (A)(1) to (A)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (B)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (B) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (D)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (B)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (B) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(B)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (B)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (B)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (B)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (B)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (D) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (C) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(B), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (D) or (E) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (C)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (D), (E) or (F) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (B) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (D), (E) or (F) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (C)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (C)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (B) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (C)(1)(a).1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (C)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (C)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (C)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (C)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (D), (E), or (F) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (F) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (D)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (D). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (D)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (D) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (D)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (F) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (D)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative
residential facility, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the
operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place may cause the convicted offender to be examined and tested for
tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to,
hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of
the operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or
other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV

(ORC2929.26)
   (E)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous

         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to

vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (E)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (3)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
(ORC2929.27)
   (F)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (F)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (F)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (F) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (E)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (E)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (F) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (E)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (D), (E),
or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (D), (E),
or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D), (E), or (F) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   (a)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (G)(4)(b)
and (G)(4)(c) of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         (b)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         (c)   A court that imposes a fine under division (G)(4)(a) of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (F)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (F)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (F)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (F)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (F)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (F)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (F)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (F)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (F) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (F), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (F) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28) (‘82 Code, § 698.02)
§ 698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (A)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.04.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of §
698.04 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under §
698.04. The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an unnecessary
burden on local government resources.
   (B)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         (b)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         (c)   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         (d)   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor
made the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of
the offense more serious;
         (e)   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (B)(1)(b) and
(c) of this section;
         (f)   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         (g)   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (B)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in §
698.04.
   (C)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(C), (D), (E), and (F). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under §
698.02(B) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (D)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim’s right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22) (‘82 Code, § 698.03)
§ 698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in §
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
606.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;

      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$1,000.
   (B)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (C)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (D)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 606.08,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.
(ORC 2929.31) (‘82 Code, § 698.04)
§ 698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the
state, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (B)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (B)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08
or 4511.19 or a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a
vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution
when the trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When
consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are
imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this
division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms
imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before
serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

Section

863.02   Hookah bars
§ 863.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HOOKAH. A type of water pipe used to smoke tobacco or other legal non-
tobacco substances, in which air is heated by charcoal or burning embers and
passed through the tobacco or other substance to form smoke, and the smoke then
passes through a water-filled chamber where it is filtered and cooled, and then
inhaled through a tube and mouthpiece by one or more users during a smoking
session which may last from 45 to 60 minutes or longer. At the end of a smoking
session, the dirty water is discarded and the water chamber is refilled for the
next user(s). The term HOOKAH may also be referred to as a water pipe,
narghile, argileh, goza, or hubble bubble.
   HOOKAH BAR. A smoking establishment whose business operation, whether as its
primary use or as an ancillary use, is devoted to the on-premises use of
hookahs. The term HOOKAH BAR includes but is not limited to establishments
variously known as hookah parlors, hookah cafcs, and hookah lounges.
   RETAIL TOBACCO STORE. A retail establishment that derives more than 80% of
its gross revenue from the sale of cigars, cigarettes, pipes, or other smoking
devices for burning tobacco and related smoking accessories and in which the
sale of other products is merely incidental. RETAIL TOBACCO STORE does not
include a tobacco department, or section of a larger commercial establishment,
or of  any establishment with a liquor permit, or of any restaurant. In the
event of a conflict between this definition and the definition of "retail
tobacco store" provided in R.C. Chapter 3794: Smoking Ban, the Ohio Revised
Code definition shall prevail.
   SMOKING ESTABLISHMENT. An establishment in which tobacco products are sold
for use or consumption on the premises to persons age 21 and older as provided
by state law. The term SMOKING ESTABLISHMENT includes but is not limited to
establishments referred to as smoking, cigar, or tobacco bars or lounges, but

         (b)   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If the City Council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-
day period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the City Council or the ICRC shall hold at least
one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and
record objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may request the secretary to record the
objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing
anytime before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to
be made part of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the
objector's name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the City Council or the ICRC shall review the rates using the
benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC.
Based on the City Council's or the ICRC's findings, the initial basic cable
rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and
the initial date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showing. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The City Council will
review a cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve initial basic
cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary
showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the
benchmark or below the cable operator's September 30, 1992, rates minimum 10%,
will prescribe the cable operator's new rates.
   (I)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion by the city or the ICRC of
its review of the cable operator's proposed rates, the City Council shall adopt
its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the
following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the City Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the City Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      (2)   Rollback and refunds. If the City Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or
that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the
City Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with division (G) or (H)
of this section, as applicable. In addition, the City Council may order the
cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the
rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal
Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to
September 1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will
be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's
decision resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in
the official newspaper of the city.
   (J)   Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.
(`82 Code, § 876.02) (Ord. 94-02, passed 1-4-94)
§ 876.03 REVIEW OF REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (A)   Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and the ICRC and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the
cable operator desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be
given more often than annually and not until at least one year after the
determination of the initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the City Council or the ICRC is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
price cap, the City Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city.
      (2)   If the City Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
      (3)   During the extended review period and before taking action on the
proposed rate, the City Council or the ICRC shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the City Council and the ICRC are unable to determine whether
the rate increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the
material before it, or if the cable operator sets a cost-of-service showing,
the City Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the City Council or the ICRC needs more time to
ensure that the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
as determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   One hundred fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable
price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the City Council has not made a decision within the 90- to 150-
day period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
   (D)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the City Council or the ICRC shall hold
at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views
and record objections.
   (E)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may request the secretary to record the objection
during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the secretary with the objector's name
and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the City Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the City Council later issued a decision disapproving any
portion of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the City Council
shall review the rate using a price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City Council's findings, the
basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the City Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the City Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the
cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   (I)   Decision. The City Council's decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increases, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person requesting the City Secretary to record the objection or may be
submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (J)   Refunds.
      (1)   The City Council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments
with interest if:
         (a)   The City Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in division (C) of this section; and
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The City Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the City Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      (2)   The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with the FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
   (K)   Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.

§ 876.04 CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.

or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the City
Council or the ICRC may require the cable operator to produce information in
addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to
make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the
information be kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the City Council or the ICRC may request additional information
only in order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with
the standard.
   (B)   Request for confidentiality. A cable operator submitting information
to the City Council may request in writing that the information may be made
routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be
attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information
to which it applies.

         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or

deducted and withheld on behalf of the municipality in any month of the

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.

the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
         For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of
the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than 20 days.

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in § 180.051.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
880.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of §
880.051.

operating loss carryforward equals municipal taxable income.
      (1)   Income for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the net
profit of the taxpayer.
         (a)   Net profit for a person other than an individual is defined in §
880.03(C)(22).
         (b)   Adjusted federal taxable income is defined in §

telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
880.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
880.19(A).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
880.19(A).
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, wages, salaries, and other
compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an
employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (C)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
      A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
880.081.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under §
880.03(C)(10)(l) and (C)(33)(a), by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   QUALIFYING REMOTE EMPLOYEE OR OWNER means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
QUALIFYING REMOTE WORK LOCATION may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   REPORTING LOCATION means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under §
880.05 on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (d)   QUALIFYING REPORTING LOCATION means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during

            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (I)(1)(d)1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (I)(1)(d)1. or 2. of this section, the location that
the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying
reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is
recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may
change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner
under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
or (B) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2) of this section:
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (A)(3) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(3) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to §
880.05.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that

division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

880.03(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or

corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the

purpose of making the computations required in §
880.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
880.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under §
880.062 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §

taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in divisions (C)(1)
(a) through (d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
880.091.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;

tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
880.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.

for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the municipal
corporation, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal corporation
income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another municipal
corporation, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other municipal
corporation. The credit shall not exceed 2.0% of the tax assessed by this

§ 880.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
QUALIFYING LOSS means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the QUALIFYING LOSS is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   QUALIFYING TAX RATE means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the QUALIFYING TAX RATE is
a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be
based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
880.096.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
880.096, the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §

for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date
the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.

preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

as in §
880.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
            The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the
city’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the
15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which

period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return

   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (F)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A) of this section, the tax administrator
shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to
the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before
the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs first. If a tax
administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal corporation
shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to respond to
such inquiry or notice, up to $150. Division (A) of this section does not apply
to an extension received under division (A) of this section if the tax
administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a
federal extension as required to receive the extension under division (A) of
this section or failed to file for an extension under division (A) of this
section.

      (2)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the applicable

overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
880.096. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
880.18.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §

§ 880.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, CLAIM means a claim for an amount payable to
the municipality that  arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed

payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
880.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
880.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
880.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in §
880.99 for a violation of §
880.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial

   (A)   An OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR means an opinion issued under this
section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not
include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an opinion of the Tax Administrator and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an opinion of the Tax Administrator.
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
880.15.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.

received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) of this section may not be

§ 880.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an employee of
the municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board's final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section

extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
880.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
880.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by §
880.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (D) of this

of that tax, on or before the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall
be assessed, collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such
unpaid amount at the rate per annum prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47 from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under R.C. § 718.90, whichever occurs first.

corporation pursuant to R.C. § 718.15 or 718.151, shall be available to a

municipal corporation's tax on income.

taxpayer's tax return, documentation issued by the municipal corporation
granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
         (b)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
         (c)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax

until a permit is obtained from the City Engineer or Building Commissioner.
(`82 Code, § 1022.01) (Ord. 92-88, passed 6-2-92)
§ 1022.02 CONSTRUCTION.
   Sidewalks, handicapped ramps, and driveways shall be constructed according
to the standard details on file at the Municipal Building and as described
herein.
   (A)   Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide in non-residential
areas and four feet wide in residential areas and five inches thick and of one
course construction, laid directly on prepared subgrade, of ODOT Class “C”
concrete.
   (B)   Driveways from the paved roadway to the private property line shall be
not less than seven inches thick concrete of Class “C” mix. All commercial
driveways shall be adequate to carry the load to which they are subjected with
the subgrade evenly fine graded and solidly compacted with a five-ton roller.
   (C)   Driveway entrances shall have a width of not less than 15 feet nor
more than 24 feet for single family residential properties or 35 feet for
multi-family residential and all non-residential properties measured at the
curb line. No driveway entrance shall be constructed as step down driveways,
that is, having vertical curbs. Multiple driveway entrances will be permitted
where necessary and with the approval of the City Engineer, but not to exceed a
width of 35 feet measured at the curb line for each multiple driveway entrance,
separated by pedestrian safety islands; the safety islands to be in whole units
or car parking spaces, as follows: 28 feet, 48 feet, 68 feet, or any additional
number of 20 foot spaces. Driveway entrances shall not be located less than 24
feet from a street intersection measured along the curb line.
   (D)   Driveways across sidewalks shall have a depth of the abutting private
property adequate to permit a vehicle to completely clear the sidewalk right-
of-way so that no part of the vehicle shall remain on or project over such
right-of-way. Where such driveway enters a parking lot, provisions must be made
to turn around and head out.
   (E)   Where driveways serve other than residential property, driving on the
sidewalk area shall be confined to a width at the curb line, by the
construction of suitable curbs or barriers; the curbs or barriers to be
constructed of concrete, wooden timbers or other suitable materials,
permanently and firmly set or anchored in the ground. The curb or barrier shall
extend at least seven inches above the surface of the ground or paved area. In
cases where the private property is used for parking vehicles in a position
other than parallel to the street property line, these curbs or barriers shall
be located or constructed as to prevent any part of the parked vehicles from
extending over the sidewalk area.
   (F)   No driveway entrance shall interfere with municipal facilities such as
streetlighting pole, traffic signal standards, signs, catch basins, hydrants,
crosswalks, bus-loading platforms, bus stops, utility poles, underground pipes
or ducts or other necessary street structures. Arrangements will have to be
made with the City Engineer or Public Works Superintendent for the adjustment
or relocation of the facility affected before a driveway permit will be issued.
In no case will it be permissible for a curb cut to be located closer than
three feet to any pole, inlet, and the like.
   (G)   If at any time it is found that the driveway provisions set forth are
impracticable for a particular case, the applicant may appeal to the Safety-
Service Director.

   (A)   All private driveways and improved easements for vehicular ingress and
egress which intersect at any point with the public streets and thoroughfares
of the city that exceed 100 feet in length and provide access to more than one
single family home, multifamily dwellings and businesses shall be maintained in
a condition so that they are passable by motor vehicular traffic including
police and fire/paramedic vehicles to all structures serviced by said private
driveways or improved easements for vehicular ingress and egress.
   (B)   Any such private driveway or improved easement for vehicular ingress
and egress which because of its construction, weather, advanced age, neglect,
lack of maintenance, fire, explosion, earthquake, vandalism, or other cause
natural or man made, has been rendered impassable, or is in danger of becoming
impassable to motor vehicular traffic including police and fire/paramedic
vehicles is hereby declared to be a nuisance and a danger to the health and
safety of the citizens of the city.
   (C)   All such private driveways and improved easements as described in
division (A) of this section shall be inspected at least once annually by the
Fire Chief of the city who shall review his findings with the Director of
Public Works and the Safety Service Director and report them to the Council.
Said findings shall include a description of the private driveways and improved
easements inspected and his appraisal of the condition of said driveway or
improved easement. Said findings shall further list any driveway or improved
easement that in his opinion is no longer passable or is in danger of becoming
impassable to motor vehicular traffic including police and fire/paramedic
vehicles and the grounds upon which his opinion is based.
   (D)   In the event that Council accepts the Fire Chief's findings that any
such private driveway or improved easement is impassable or in danger of
becoming impassable the Fire Chief shall proceed as follows:
      (1)   In the event that such private driveway or improved easement is
impassable, the Fire Chief shall deliver a copy of his findings to the owners
of record of such private driveway or improved easement, and the owners of
record of any parcel which benefits by such private driveway or improved
easement as listed on the tax duplicate on file with the Auditor of Hamilton
County by certified United States mail to the address listed on the tax
duplicate together with an order that said private driveway or improved
easement shall be repaired as indicated in said order within ten days of the
date of said order. The Fire Chief shall cause a copy of said findings and
order to be conspicuously placed at the intersection of said private driveway
or improved easement and all public streets and thoroughfares. The Fire Chief
shall further cause a copy of said findings and order to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation within Hamilton County, Ohio.
      (2)   In the event that said private driveway or improved easement is in
danger of becoming impassable, the Fire Chief shall proceed as provided in
division (D)(1) except that the order to repair said private driveway or
improved easement shall specify that the private driveway or improved easement
shall be repaired within 60 days of the date of the order.
   (E)   In the event that said private driveways or improved easements which
are found to be impassable or in danger of becoming impassable are not repaired
as provided in division (D) of this section, the Council may by resolution
direct that the city repair such private driveway or improved easement
assessing the costs of said repairs to the owners of record of said private
driveway or improved easement and the owners of record of any parcel which
benefits by such private driveway or improved easement on a per capita basis.
Such assessment shall be made as a special assessment in the manner specified
in Title 7 of the Ohio Revised Code. All amounts which remain unpaid shall be
reported to the Treasurer of Hamilton County for collection as specified in
said title.
   (F)   Plans of repair whether privately or publicly done shall be submitted
to the Director of Public Works for his review and approval. Repairs shall meet
all standards required for private and public fire lanes as specified in the
city Fire Code.
   (G)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      IMPASSABLE. A private driveway or an improved easement is impassable when
because of age, neglect, deterioration or disaster - natural or man made - the
private driveway or improved easement will no longer support motor vehicular
traffic of the type necessary to provide police and fire/paramedic service to
any one of the parcels, residences, or businesses served by the private
driveway or improved easement. It is prima facia evidence that a private
driveway or improved easement is impassable when it does not meet the standards
required for private and public fire lanes as specified in the city Fire Code.
      IN DANGER OF BECOMING IMPASSABLE. A private driveway or improved easement
is in danger of becoming impassable if in the opinion of the Fire Chief of the
city the private driveway or improved easement is more likely than not to
become impassable within the next 60 days.
      PARCEL BENEFITTING. A parcel benefits by the use of a private driveway or
improved easement if the owners, occupiers, tenants or users of said parcel
have used said private driveway or improved easement for access to that parcel
on any date in the preceding calendar year. It is prima facia evidence that
such use occurred if the private driveway or improved easement provides the
sole means of motor vehicular ingress and egress to said parcel OR there exists
on said parcel a driveway which connects to the private driveway or improved
easement that is subject to the order.

Editor's note:
   Ordinance 283-1942, passed January 19, 1942, authorized the Service Director
to enter into a contract with the Municipality of Lockland for furnishing an
auxiliary water supply to such municipality. Copies of such contract may be
obtained, at cost, at the City Hall.
   Ordinance 84-36, passed 8-7-84, adopted the Water Department Rules and
Regulations. Copies of such ordinance and the rules and regulations may be
obtained, at cost, at the City Hall.
§ 1040.01 AUTHORITY OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICE.
   (A)   Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, any absolute or
discretionary authority granted in this chapter is to the Safety-Service
Director (except when the language plainly provides a direct grant of any such
authority to one or more of his or her assistants as well) and the duties set
forth in this chapter shall be performed by the Director (except when the
language plainly provides that one or more of his or her assistants are
included).
   (B)   As used in this chapter, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICE
means the Safety-Service Director and only those officers and employees
actually authorized by him or her to assist in the administration of his or her
duties. Adequate facilities for communicating with the Director and his or her
authorized assistants are available to the public, and no official, officer or
employee in another department of the city has any authority to bind or
obligate the Director or his or her assistants.
   (C)   This chapter is intended to make violations of any of the provisions
of this chapter and of future regulations or rules of the Safety-Service
Director offenses against the city and is not intended to limit the authority
of the Director over the city's waterworks under the laws of the state. Except
where the contrary is herein plainly provided, the authority of the Director to
conduct and manage the affairs and business of the waterworks whenever,
wherever and however he or she considers most prudent is hereby acknowledged
and approved. Any interference with his or her activities in such respects are
hereby declared a violation of this chapter, punishable as other violations
hereof.
   (D)   In order that notice may be more readily provided the citizens of the
city, as well as nonresident consumers, of the duties of the Department of
Public Safety and Service to consumers, and also the duty of each consumer to
the Department, to enable the supplying of a maximum of service at a minimum of
expense and loss, the Safety-Service Director is hereby authorized and directed
to have copies of this chapter printed and distributed in such number to ensure
distribution to at least every subscriber of the Water Department.
(`82 Code, § 1040.01) (Ord. 62-1934, passed 12-20-34)
§ 1040.02 RATES.
   From and after the effective date of this section (Ordinance 90-46, passed
May 15, 1990), the following rates shall be charged by the city for water:
   (A)   Use in the city.
      (1)   The rate for water charge(wr) shall be a pass through of the rate
set forth by the Greater Cincinnati Water Works (GCWW). The minimum charge
shall be 500 cubic feet per month.
      (2)   The minimum charge shall be set forth in division (A)(1) of this
section and, in determining such charge, each apartment unit and each mobile
home space shall be considered as a separate unit and subject to the minimum
charge, whether occupied or unoccupied.
   (B)   Use outside the city. For all water used there shall be a charge not
to exceed 10% of the rates paid by the residents of the city.
   (C)   Improvements. Council finds that in order to raise funds for expenses
and necessary improvements of the Water Department and water system, an actual
usage charge per 100 cubic feet is established. This charge is in addition to
the charge already established in this section and may be adjusted by the
Safety Service Director as necessary.
(`82 Code, § 1040.02) (Ord. 90-45, passed 5-15-90; Ord. 90-46, passed 5-15-90;
Am. Ord. 2014-25, passed 4-22-14; Am. Ord. 2014-39, passed 6-17-14)
§ 1040.03 PAYMENT OF CHARGES; REMITTANCES.
   (A)   All water charges shall be payable monthly on or before the sixteenth
day of each month for the next prior reading period. In the event a meter is
not read to determine the charge due for a reading period, an estimate shall be
made and a charge made on the basis of the next prior period for which the
meter was read. Payments made after the sixteenth day of the month following
the prior reading period shall include a penalty charge of 10% of the amount
due.
   (B)   The Safety-Service Director may remit the 10% penalty provided for in
division (A) of this section whenever he or she determines the delay in payment
to have been due to good cause, or excusable, and that the financial condition
of the fund will be aided thereby. However, such remittance shall be allowed
only when service has not been discontinued, and no one consumer shall be
granted more than two such remittances in any calendar year.
(`82 Code, § 1040.03) (Ord. 62-1934, passed 12-20-34; Am. Ord. 61-10, passed 2-
6-61)
§ 1040.04 METERS REQUIRED; COMBINED USE.
   (A)   Every separate residence, business and industry shall have a separate
water meter, and all consumers shall be charged the rates set forth in §
1040.02 for each meter without accumulating the number of cubic feet used on
the several meters of one consumer unless such consumer is paying a minimum
amount established by Council. However, where two or more meters are used in
one business or industrial organization, the number of cubic feet of water used
on such meters may be accumulated to effect a reduced rate if the property of
such business or industrial organization is contiguous or separated only by
public property. Each single-family dwelling and each apartment building
containing two or more dwelling units shall be considered a separate residence
requiring at least one water meter. For the purposes of this section, motels,
hotels, trailer parks, religious institutions (including schools of such
institutions), public schools, charitable institutions and other like
institutions are considered businesses.
   (B)   All services to premises accessible to each other, except by a street
in the front or a public alley in the rear, or which are supplied by one
service pipe may be included in one bill, and the applicant for such a service
shall be responsible for the payment of all water rent and the proper use of
water so furnished.
(`82 Code, § 1040.04) (Ord. 62-1934, passed 12-20-34)
§ 1040.05 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE; DEPOSITS.
   (A)   The Safety-Service Director is hereby authorized to provide for
deposits to be made by consumers at the time application for water service is
made. Each deposit shall be based on the estimated consumption of water per
month, which estimate shall be made by the Water Department. Such deposit shall
be reasonable and just and shall not exceed $300. However, the Director shall
waive such deposit for an applicant who is the owner of the real estate where
the service is to be made or for whom the owner guarantees payment of water
rents and penalties.
   (B)   The application shall be on a form and in terms prescribed by the
Director and shall provide that the applicant will abide by all of the rules
and regulations prescribed by the Director and shall agree that water service
may be terminated if water rents are delinquent for five days. The application
shall further provide that the deposit shall be security for payment of water
rents, including penalties, and shall be retained in payment of water rents,
including penalties, when service is discontinued, without right of the
applicant or his or her creditors to recover any part of the deposit not in
excess of water rents and penalties due.
   (C)   The Director shall make such other rules and regulations as he or she
deems beneficial in the management and conduct of the waterworks and the water
distribution system of the city.
(`82 Code, § 1040.05) (Ord. 61-10, passed 2-6-61; Am. Ord. 78-92, passed 12-19-
78)
§ 1040.06 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE; RESPONSIBILITY OF OWNER.
   (A)   If water service is discontinued by reason of default in payment of
delinquent water rents and penalties, the service shall not be reinstated until
all delinquent charges and penalties are paid.
   (B)   An owner (including purchasers) of real estate whose premises are
provided with water service connections shall be considered as accepting the
provisions of this chapter and all lawful rules and regulations fixed by this
chapter and the Safety-Service Director relating to the consumption of water,
and as agreeing, in particular, to be liable for all water rents and penalties
for such premises whether the accounts for such premises are carried in the
name of the owner, a former owner, a tenant or another person.
   (C)   The Safety Service Director will first mail a current bill/invoice to
all account holders of record statement that utility payment must be made
within 16 days of billing. If payment is not made to an account, it will be
deemed past due. When the next month's bill is mailed, it will notify the
delinquent account holder:
      (1)   That their account is past due.
      (2)   The amount that is past due.
      (3)   The date the past due must be paid to avoid shutoff.
   If this is ignored, the water for this account will be shutoff.
(`82 Code, § 1040.06) (Ord. 61-10, passed 2-6-61; Am. Ord. 2000-77, passed 9-5-
00; Am. Ord. 2007-20, passed 3-6-07; Am. Ord. 2014-25, passed 4-22-14)
§ 1040.07 REFUSAL OF APPLICATION; SERVICE.
   No application for water shall be allowed and no water service shall be
supplied to an applicant or consumer when it is apparent that the applicant or
consumer is indebted to the city for delinquent water rents, including
penalties, whether such delinquency occurs at the premises for which
application is made or at any other premises supplied by the waterworks and/or
the water distribution system of the city.
(`82 Code, § 1040.07) (Ord. 61-10, passed 2-6-61)
§ 1040.08 LIENS FOR UNPAID BILLS; ESTIMATES OF CHARGES.
   (A)   A lien is hereby created upon the real estate premises where water is
furnished and water rents, including penalties, are not paid as required by
this chapter. Such lien may be certified to the County Auditor for collection
by him or her of water rents, including penalties, along with real estate
taxes.
   (B)   If a meter fails to function properly, rents for water consumed shall
be made on the same number of cubic feet consumed in the same month of the
prior year, and in case there is no record of prior charges, the Safety-Service
Director shall fix reasonable water rents from available information. Other
estimated charges made for water rents for want of reading a meter shall be
adjusted through the next subsequent reading and billing.

sufficient.
   (G)   Every applicant supplied with water shall be held responsible for all
water registered by his or her meter, and no reduction of bills shall be
allowed for leaks on the premises or water used by contractors or other

§ 1048.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE; SCOPE.
   (A)   The city is vitally concerned with the use of all rights of way in the
city as such rights of way are a valuable and limited resource which must be
utilized to promote the public health, safety, and welfare including the
economic development of the city.
   (B)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to rights of way, and in particular,
the development and deployment of “small wireless facilities” have affected the
placement of facilities and structures therein.
   (C)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and
structures and facilities in, the rights of way to promote efficiency,
discourage uneconomic duplication of facilities, lessen the public
inconvenience of uncoordinated work in the rights of way, minimize the
blighting effects associated with unattractive visual clutter, and promote the
public health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   The city has authority under the laws and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, including but not limited to Article 18, Sections 3, 4, and 7, to
regulate public and private entities which use the rights of way.

§ 1048.05 NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   A certificate of registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in
the rights of way. A certificate of registration is only the nonexclusive,
limited right to occupy rights of way in the city for the limited purposes and
for the limited period stated in the certificate of registration and in
accordance with this chapter and all laws including any rules and regulations
adopted by the Safety Service Director. The rights to locate facilities and/or
a system in and the rights to occupy the right of way itself may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however provider may sublease capacity (or
other non-material facility aspects) and two or more providers may collocate
facilities in the same area of the rights of way so long as each such provider
complies with the provisions of this chapter. Collocating providers may file a
joint application for a construction permit. A certificate of registration does
not excuse a provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment
agreements before collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including
the city's facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a
provider from leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the
sharing of facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the
provisions of this chapter. A certificate of registration does not excuse a
provider from complying with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable
law.

§ 1048.06 OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.

all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such services from the appropriate federal, state
and localauthorities and upon the city's reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the city. Further, a certificate of registration
issued pursuant to this chapter shall not entitle a provider to use, alter,
convert to, or interfere with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits,
lines, pipelines, wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property
of any kind whatsoever under the management or control of the city.

§ 1048.19 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Technical information required. Prior to commencement of any initial
construction of facilities in the rights of way a construction permittee, upon
the reasonable request of the city, shall provide technical information about
the proposed route of construction. The technical information required may
consist of completion of the following tasks:
      (1)   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats, and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
      (2)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts, and visible street cut
repairs.
      (3)   Determine and record the presence of and the approximate horizontal
and vertical location of all underground facilities the applicant or person on
whose behalf the permit was applied for owns or controls in the rights of way
along the proposed system route. Upon the reasonable request of the Safety
Service Director, a permittee shall also record and identify the general
location of all other facilities in the rights of way along the proposed system
route. For the purposes of this section, general location shall mean the
alignment of other facilities in the rights of way, but shall not necessarily
mean the depth of other facilities in the rights of way.
      (4)   If a provider records the information requested above in an
electronic format, the provider shall provide the city with an electronic copy
of the data obtained from completion of the tasks described in this section.
Incorporation of the data required herein (division (A) et seq.) by electronic
means shall include only data for new facilities that can be readily
incorporated into the city's database.
      (5)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict with the plans as drafted,
construction permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. A construction permittee shall not excavate more than a
three foot by three foot square hole in the rights of way to complete this
task.
      (6)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (7)   All confidential/proprietary information submitted herein shall be
so labeled.
   (B)   Qualified firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by a firm specializing in utility engineering
or may be performed by the construction permittee if the construction permittee
is qualified to complete the project itself.
   (C)   Cost of study. The construction permittee shall bear the cost of
compliance with divisions (A) through (C) of this section.
   (D)   Construction schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in this chapter,
or unless the Building Department waives any of the requirements of this
section due to unique or unusual circumstances, a construction permittee shall
be required to submit a written construction schedule to the city ten working
days before commencing any work in or about the rights of way and, shall
further notify the city not less than two working days in advance of any
excavation in the rights of way. This section shall apply to all situations
with the exception of emergency situations as described in this chapter.
   (E)   Location of facilities.
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws.
      (2)   The city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of
new or additional facilities within the rights of way if the right of way is
full. In making such decisions, the city shall strive to the extent possible to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights of way, but shall be
guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety, and welfare,
the condition of the rights of way, the time of year, the protection of
existing facilities in the rights of way, future city and county plans for
public improvements, development projects which have been determined to be in
the public interest, and the non-discriminatory and competitively neutral
treatment of providers.
      (3)   Upon the concurrence of the city, or if it is determined by the
construction permittee and any appropriate local, state, or federal agency (or
other entity with jurisdictional authority) that any existing poles in the
rights of way are full, then those poles may be replaced with bigger and/or
taller poles in order to accommodate additional facilities or systems only
after the construction permittee has made reasonable attempts to reach an
acceptable solution without replacement with bigger and/or taller poles. This
division shall not apply to replacement of any existing pole(s) with
identically sized pole(s) which results from the destruction of or hazardous
condition of the existing pole(s) as long as no new facilities or additional
facilities are attached.
   (F)   Least disruptive technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights of way. In addition, all cable, wire or
fiber optic cable installed in the subsurface rights of way under this chapter
may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable, wire
or fiber optic cable may be installed under this chapter using "direct bury"
techniques.
   (G)   Relocation of facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall, at its own expense, permanently remove and
relocate its facilities in the rights of way whenever the city finds it
necessary to request such removal and relocation. In instances where the city
requests removal and/or relocation, the city shall waive all applicable
construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the provider shall
restore the rights of way to a condition at least as good as its condition
immediately prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are required
to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poleswill be replaced with
reasonably obtainable poles of the same or similar size unless otherwise
permitted by the city. The city may request relocation and/or removal in order
to prevent unreasonable interference by the provider's facilities with:
         (a)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the city or
county;
         (b)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights of way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
right of way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the city, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated portion
or excess portion in conformity with Ohio R.C. 723.04.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the city, a provider fails to
commence the removal process and/or relocation of its facilities as designated
by the city, within 30 days after the city's removal order is served upon
provider, or if a provider fails to substantially complete such removal,
including all associated repair of the rights of way of the city, within 12
months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable law,
the city shall have the right to:
         (a)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the city with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited to,
the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation;
         (b)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider
in, on, over or under the rights of way of the city at provider's cost and
expense, by another person, however the city shall have no liability for any
damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the city for
all reasonable costs incurred by the city in such action; and
         (c)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights of way of the city
designated by the city for removal and not timely removed by the provider shall
belong to and become the property of the city without payment to the provider,
and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the city shall
request, in form and substance acceptable to the city, to evidence such
ownership by the city.
   (H)   Pre-excavation facilities location. Before the start date of any
rights of way excavation, each provider who has facilities located in the area
to be excavated shall be responsible to mark the horizontal and make every
reasonable attempt using best efforts, to mark the approximate vertical
placement of all its facilities. All providers shall notify and work closely
with the excavation contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of
its facilities and the best procedure for excavation.
   (I)   Rights of way restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights of way as required herein, must be completed within the dates specified
in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the
general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill,
paving and its foundations in accordance with the standards established by the
Safety Service Director, subject to any applicable laws. The permittee must
also inspect the area of the work and use reasonable care to maintain the same
condition for 12 months thereafter.
      (2)   In approving an application for a permit, the city may choose
either to have the permittee restore the rights of way or the city may restore
the rights of way itself at the expense of the permittee.
      (3)   If the city chooses to allow permittee to restore the rights of
way, construction permittee shall at the time of application of a construction
permit posta construction bond in an amount determined by the city to be
sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the rights of way to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to construction. If, 12 months
after completion of the restoration of the rights of way, the city determines
that the rights of way have been properly restored, the surety on the
construction bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified and approved by the city. In all cases, rights of
way and the affected surrounding areas shall be restored to a condition at
least as good as its condition immediately prior to the construction work, and
in accordance with the city approved right of way restoration plan proposed by
the permittee with his or her construction permit application. As relates to
the restoration of paving, all such restorations shall be done in a manner
ensuring that the roadway quality, integrity and life cycle longevity after the
restoration are at least as good as they were immediately prior to the
construction work. In addition, any street that is opened during the
construction work that has been paved or re-paved within the five years
immediately prior to the construction work permit application, shall be re-
paved from the road centerline to the gutter throughout the opened pavement
areas affected by the construction work.
      (5)   By restoring the rights of way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this
12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the Building Department,
correct all restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required
by the Safety Service Director. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Building Department.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights of way in the manner
and to the condition required by the city, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the city, the city, at its option, with
notice to provider and a reasonable time to cure, may do such work. In that
event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30 days of billing, the cost
of restoring the rights of way and any other costs incurred by the city. Upon
failure to pay, the city may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by
permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   All restoration required within an Improved Streetscape Area shall
be accomplished by a contractor approved by the Safety Service Director to the
original specifications for construction within said Improved Streetscape Area.
At the option of the permittee, such restoration may be accomplished by the
city at the permittee's cost. In the event that the restoration is performed by
the city, the permittee shall advance the cost of the restoration as determined
by the engineer's estimate prior to the restoration. In the event that the
actual cost of the improvement is greater than the estimate, the permittee
shall pay the difference to the city within 30 days following the completion of
the restoration. In the event that the actual cost of the restoration is less
than the engineer's estimate, the city shall refund the difference to the
permittee upon the completion of the restoration.
   (J)   Damage to provider's facilities and to other facilities.
      (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the city
performs work in the rights of way and finds it necessary to maintain, support,
or move a provider's facilities to protect those facilities, the costs
associated therewith will be billed to that provider and shall be paid within
30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the city may pursue all
legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider does not pay or the city
may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and pursue any
and all legal or equitable remedies.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
facilities in the rights of way which it or its facilities damage. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the city's response to an
emergency caused by such provider's facilities.
   (K)   Rights of way vacation.  If the city vacates a rights of way which
contains the facilities of a provider, such vacation shall be subject to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. 723.04.
   (L)   Installation requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights of way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws and the standards as promulgated by the
Safety Service Director.
   (M)   Inspection.
      (1)   When the construction under any permit hereunder is completed, the
permittee shall notify the Building Department.
      (2)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (3)   At any time, including the time of inspection, the inspector may
order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the
health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates
the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this chapter.
      (4)   The inspector may issue an order to correct work which does not
conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. The
order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be cause for
revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as provided
in §
1048.24(D). An order may be appealed to the Safety Service Director. The
decision of the Safety Service Director may be appealed to the BZA whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten days after issuance of the
order, the provider shall present proof to the Safety Service Director that the
violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been presented within the
required time, the Safety Service Director may revoke the permit pursuant to §
1048.21(E).
   (N)   Other obligations. Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve
permittee of its duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and
authority and to pay all fees, including on-site inspection fees, required by
the city, or any other city, county, state, or federal laws.
      (1)   A permittee shall comply with all requirements of laws, including
the requirements of the Ohio Utility Protection Service (OUPS) and/or its

certificate of registration;
      (2)   Submission of a completed minor maintenance permit application in
the form required by the Director of Public Service.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control
Devices, will prevent injury or damage to persons or property and to minimize
disruptions to the efficient movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (C)   Issuance of minor maintenance permits; conditions.
      (1)   If the Safety Service Director determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this chapter and the minor maintenance permit
process, the Safety Service Director shall issue a minor maintenance permit
subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The city may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the rules
and regulations enacted by the Safety Service Director, upon the issuance of
the minor maintenance permit and the performance of the minor maintenance
permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights of way, to protect
the property and safety of other users of the rights of way, and to minimize
the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Minor maintenance permit fees. The Safety Service Director shall,
after providing notice to and seeking input from all providers with systems in
the right of way, develop and maintain a schedule of permit fees in an amount
sufficient to recoup all reasonable costs associated with processing minor
maintenance permits, as allowed by law. Such permit fees shall be published in
the city's annual fee schedule as set by city ordinance. No minor maintenance
permit shall be issued without payment of minor maintenance permit fees except
to the city or county, which shall be exempt. Minor maintenance permit fees
that were paid for a minor maintenance permit that the city has revoked due to
breach are not refundable. The Safety Service Director may revoke the minor
maintenance permit as any other permit may be revoked under this chapter.
(Ord. 2002-33, passed 4-16-02)
§ 1048.21 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (A)   Mandatory denial of permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
construction permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application;
      (2)   To any person or their agent who has outstanding debt owed to the
city;
      (3)   To any person or their agent as to whom there exists grounds for
the revocation of a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Safety Service Director, the issuance
of a permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or
interfere with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The
Safety Service Director, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights of way,
and by considerations relating to the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (B)   Permissive denial. The Safety Service Director may deny a permit in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, to prevent
interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights
of way, or when necessary to protect the rights of way and its users. The
Safety Service Director, in his or her discretion, may consider one or more of
the following factors: the extent to which rights of way space where the permit
is sought is available; the competing demands for the particular space in the
rights of way; the availability of other locations in the rights of way or in
other rights of way for the proposed facilities; the applicability of this
chapter or other regulations of the rights of way that affect location of
facilities in the rights of way; the degree of compliance of the provider with
the terms and conditions of this chapter and its requirements, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations; the degree of disruption to surrounding
communities and businesses that will result from the use of that part of the
rights of way; the condition and age of the rights of way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; the balancing of the
costs of disruption to the public and damage to the rights of way against the
benefits to that part of the public served by the expansion into additional
parts of the rights of way; and whether such applicant or its agent has failed
within the past three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance,
with the requirements of this chapter or, if applicable, any other chapters of
the codified ordinances, or any other applicable law.
   (C)   Discretionary issuance. Notwithstanding the provisions of division (A)
of this section, the Safety Service Director may issue a permit in any case
where the permit is necessary:
      (1)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the city;
      (2)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
      (3)   To allow a new economic development project. To be granted a permit
under this section, the permit applicant must not have had knowledge of the
hardship, the plans for improvement of service, or the development project at
the time it was required to submit its list of next year projects.
   (D)   Work done without a permit.
      (1)   Emergency situations. Each provider shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable, notify the Building Department of any event regarding its
facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to
take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency.
Within two business days, unless otherwise extended by the Safety Service
Director, after the occurrence or discovery of the emergency (whichever is
later), the provider shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees
associated therewith and fulfill all the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this chapter for any and all actions taken in response to
the emergency. In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency
regarding a provider's facilities, the city may attempt to contact the provider
or system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. Inany event, the city may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an emergency, any
provider who constructs in, on, above, within, over, below or through a right
of way without a valid permit shall subsequently obtain a permit, pay double
the normal fee for said permit, pay double all the other fees required by the
codified ordinances, deposit with the city the fees necessary to correct any
damage to the rights of way and comply with all of the requirements of this
chapter.
   (E)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the codified ordinances
as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves the right, as provided
herein, to revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a
substantial breach of the terms and conditions of any law or any provision or
condition of the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but
shall not be limited to, the following:
         (a)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit;
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the city or its citizens;
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit;
         (d)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain required construction or
removal bonds and/or insurance;
         (e)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration;
         (f)   The failure to complete construction in a timely manner; or
         (g)   The failure to correct any nonconformity as ordered pursuant to
§
1048.19(M)(4).
      (2)   If the Safety Service Director determines that the permittee has
committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any
provision or condition of the permit, the Safety Service Director shall serve a
written demand upon the permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall
state that continued violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Upon
a substantial breach, as stated above, the Safety Service Director may place
additional or revised conditions on the permit. Any obligation of the Safety
Service Director in this section and within this chapter may be carried out by
a designated official of the Safety Service Director, including a third party
engineering firm if the Safety Service Director so directs.
      (3)   By the close of the next business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Safety Service Director
with a plan, acceptable to the Safety Service Director, for its correction.
Permittee's failure to so contact the Safety Service Director, or the
permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to
reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation
of the permit.
      (4)   From time to time, the Safety Service Director may establish a list
of standard conditions for the permit. A substantial breach of any condition
shall also constitute an unauthorized use of the public rights of way as
defined in §
1048.15.
      (5)   If a permittee commits a second substantial breach as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and not be allowed
further permits for one full year, except for emergency repairs.
      (6)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the city
for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the costs
ofcollection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such
revocation.
(Ord. 2002-33, passed 4-16-02)
§ 1048.22 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (A)   Construction bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the county or city shall deposit with the
Building Department, in a form acceptable to the Law Director, an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in an amount determined by
the Safety Service Director to be appropriate, based upon fair and reasonable
criteria. Unless a construction default, problem, or deficiency involves an
emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the Safety Service
Director shall serve the construction permittee with notice detailing any
construction default, problem, or deficiency. If the Safety Service Director
determines that correction or repair of the construction default, problem or
deficiency has not occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten
calendar days after the date following service of notification and detailing
the construction default, problem or deficiency, then the city may attach the
letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be
served on the construction permittee by the Safety Service Director.
   (B)   Removal bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration, and
continuously thereafter until 120 days after a provider's facilities have been
removed from the rights of way, (unless the city notifies the provider that a
reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall deposit with the
Building Department and maintain, in a form acceptable to the Law Director, an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or a surety bond in an amount equal
to or greater than $50,000. The Safety Service Director shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five business days after
serving notification to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency
prior to Safety Service Director's attachment of letter of credit or surety
bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall
be provided to the provider by the Safety Service Director.
   (C)   Blanket bond.  In lieu of the construction bond required by division
(A) of this section and the removal bond required by division (B) of this
section, provider may deposit with the Building Department, in a form
acceptable to the Law Director, an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit
and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000. Unless a construction default,
problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the
general public, the Safety Service Director shall make all reasonable efforts
to allow permittee a period of five business days after sending notification in
writing to the last known business address to correct or repair any
construction default, problem or deficiency prior to Safety Service Director's
attachment of letter of credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice
shall be provided to the provider by the Safety Service Director.
   (D)   Self bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by division
(A), the removal bond required by division (B) and the blanket bond required by
division (C), those providers maintaining a book value in excess of $20,000,000
may submit a statement to the Building Department requesting to self-bond. If
approval to self-bond is granted, a provider shall assure the city that such
self-bonding shall provide the city with no less protection and security than
would have been afforded to the city by a third party surety providing provider
with the types and amounts bonds detailed in the above named divisions. This
statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year;
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program; and,
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Safety Service Director.
   (E)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of this chapter;
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by
the permittee or provider's violation of this chapter or its failure to comply
with all rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city
issued pursuant to this chapter;
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the city, including permit
fees;
      (4)   The payment of premiums for the liability insurance required
pursuant to this chapter;
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights of way pursuant to this
chapter;
      (6)   The payment to the city of any amounts for which the permittee or
provider is liable that are not paid by insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the city
pursuant to this chapter or other law.
   (F)   Endorsement. The bond documents required by this section, and any
replacement bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: "It is
hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed
by the surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the
surety until 90 days after completion of construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to city of surety's intention
to cancel or not renew this bond."
   (G)   Abandonment of facilities. Any provider that intends to discontinue
use of any facilities within the public rights of way shall notify the Safety
Service Director in writing of its intent to discontinue use. The notice shall
provide at least 30 days notice before determination and shall describe the
method of removal of the facilities and the restoration of the right of way.
The permittee shall not remove or disable such facilities without written
approval of the Safety Service Director. After approval, the permittee shall
remove the facilities and complete the restoration within the maximum time of
six months, unless additional time is requested from and approved by the Safety
Service Director. In the event that the permittee requests permission to
abandon its facilities, or if the Safety Service Director determines, by
reasonable available evidence, that the permittee has in fact abandoned its
facilities, the city shall receive full title and ownership of such abandoned
facilities if the Safety Service Director elects to receive such ownership. The
permittee remains responsible for all obligations as owner of the facilities
until the conveyance to the city is completed. In the event that the city
accepts title to abandoned facility, the city does not assume any
responsibility for prior service or maintenance agreements with customers or
other service providers of the permittee.
(Ord. 2002-33, passed 4-16-02)
§ 1048.23 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   City does not accept liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
application or the grant of a permit, the city does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance, or operation of facilities.
   (B)   Indemnification. By applying for and being issued a certificate of
registration with the city a provider agrees, or by accepting a permit a
permittee is required and agrees, to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the
city's agents, elected officials, officers,employees, volunteers and
subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of
any kind arising out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance,
repair, replacement, restoration, or operation of its facilities, or out of any
activity undertaken in or near a rights of way, whether any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by a permit. A provider or
permittee further agrees that it will not bring, nor cause to be brought, any
action, suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief
against the city's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers
and subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a rights of way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider, permittee, or to the city; and the provider or permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the city, if allowable by law, shall be
entitled to assert in any action every defense or immunity that the city could
assert in its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent
with, but not limited to, the following:
      (1)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the city, its agents, elected officials, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the city or
others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and
disbursements assumed by the city in connection therewith:
         (a)   To persons or property, to the extent arising out of or through
the acts or omissions of provider, its subcontractors, agents or employees
attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the rights of
way, to which permittee's or provider's negligence shall in any way contribute.
         (b)   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider or permittee, but
excluding claims arising out of or related to city programming.
         (c)   Arising out of provider's or permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of any law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the city:
         (a)   Giving provider or permittee reasonable notice of any claim or
the commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought;
         (b)   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         (c)   Cooperating in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the city's control.
      (3)   The city shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expense of such separate counsel if employed.
(Ord. 2002-33, passed 4-16-02)
§ 1048.24 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Non-exclusive remedy. The remedies provided in this chapter are not
exclusive or in lieu of other rights and remedies that the city may have atlaw
or in equity. The city is hereby authorized at any time to seek legal and
equitable relief for actual or threatened injury to the rights of way,
including damages to the rights of way, whether caused by a violation of any of
the provisions of this chapter or other provisions of applicable law.
   (B)   Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or
portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court or, administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion
shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. If a
regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction should determine by a
final, nonappealable order that any permit, right or any portions of this
chapter are illegal or unenforceable, then any such permit or right granted or
deemed to exist hereunder shall be considered as a revocable permit with a
mutual right in either party to terminate without cause upon giving 60 days
written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of such a
revocable permit shall be the same requirements and conditions as set forth in
the permit, right or registration, respectively, except for conditions relating
to the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a permit or right
shall be considered a revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the city to issue such revocable permit and the
power to revoke it.
   (C)   Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by the granting
of a permit, or by issuing a certificate of registration under this chapter,
does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful
powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city
under the Constitution and Laws of the United States and the State of Ohio to
regulate the use of the rights of way. The permittee by its acceptance of a
permit, or provider by applying for and being issued a certificate of
registration, agrees that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or
police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested
in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to
the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A permittee or provider is deemed
to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers
of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and
welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable
general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In addition, a
permittee is deemed to acknowledge that the city may amend or alter regulations
concerning the public rights of way as a valid ongoing exercise of the police
powers of the city.
   (D)   Method of service.
      (1)   Any notice or order to a permittee or an applicant delivered by the
city or any of its officials shall be deemed to be properly served if a copy

         (b)   Successfully transmitted via facsimile transmission to the last
known fax number of the person to be served;
         (c)   Left at the usual place of business of the person to whom it is
to be served upon and with someone who is 18 years of age or older;
         (d)   Sent by certified, pre-posted U.S. mail to the last known

certified letter is not returned within 14 days after the date of mailing, then
notice may be sent by regular, pre-posted, first-class U.S.; or
         (f)   If the notice is attempted to be served by regular, first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the
letter was not delivered, or is not returned within 14 days after the date of
mailing, then notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the
structure, building, premises or property affected by such notice.
      (2)   Any notice to the city or any of its officials shall be deemed
properly served if a copy thereof is delivered personally or sent by certified,
pre-posted U.S. mail to the city at 10900 Reading Road, Cincinnati, Ohio 45241.
   (E)   Applies to all providers. This chapter shall apply to all providers
and all permittees unless expressly exempted.
   (F)   Police powers. All person's rights are subject to the police powers of
the city to adopt and enforce ordinances necessary to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the public. All persons shall comply with all applicable
laws enacted by the city pursuant to its police or other powers. In particular,
all persons shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements
pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities.
   (G)   Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of city to
enforce prompt compliance.
   (H)   Foreclosure and receivership.
      (1)   Upon the filing of any voluntary or involuntary petition under the
Bankruptcy Act by or against any provider and/or permittee, or any action for
foreclosure or other judicial sale of the provider's and/or permittee's
facilities located within the rights of way, the provider and/or permittee
shall so notify the Building Department within 14 calendar days thereof and the
provider and/or permittee's certificate of registration or permit (as
applicable) shall be deemed void and of no further force and effect.
      (2)   The city shall have the right to revoke, pursuant to the provisions
of this chapter, any certificate of registration or permit granted pursuant to
this chapter, subject to any applicable provisions of law, including the
Bankruptcy Act, 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take
over and conduct the business of the provider and/or permittee, whether in
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days or unless:
         (a)   Within 120 days after election or appointment, such receiver or
trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of the relevant
certificate of registration, any outstanding permit and of this chapter and
remedied all defaults thereunder; and,
         (b)   Said receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, shall have
executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction over the
facilities, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by
each and every provision of the relevant certificate of registration, permit,
and this chapter.
   (I)   Choice of law and forum. This chapter and the terms and conditions of
any certificate of registration or permit shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with the substantive laws of the state and the Laws of the United
States of America, specifically in that order. All providers and permittees as
a condition for the grant of any permit or issuance of any certificate of
registration agree that all disputes shall be resolved in a court of competent
jurisdiction in Hamilton County, Ohio.
   (J)   Force majeure. In the event any person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions, or obligations required by this chapter is prevented by a
cause or event not within such person's control, such inability to perform
shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as
result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events not within
the control of a provider shall include, without limitation, acts of God,
strikes, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, explosions, acts of public
enemies, and natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, landslides, and
fires.
   (K)   No warranty. The city makes no representation or warranty regarding
its right to authorize the construction of facilities on any particular rights
of way. The burden andresponsibility for making such determination shall be
upon the person constructing facilities in the rights of way.
   (L)   Continuing obligation and holdover. In the event a provider continues
to operate all or any part of the facilities after the termination, lapse, or
revocation of a certificate of registration, such provider shall continue to
comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter and other laws throughout
the period of such continued operation, provided that any such continued
operation shall in no way be construed as a renewal or other extension of the
certificate of registration, nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any,
available to the city as a result of such continued operation after the term,
including, but not limited to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between
the issuance of a certificate of registration or of a permit and any other
present or future lawful exercise of the city's regulatory or police powers
shall be resolved in favor of the latter.
   (M)   Appeals. All appeals provided for by this chapter and any notification
to the city required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via certified
mail to the BZA or Safety Service Director as specified in this chapter.
   (N)   City standards. As part of city required standards, wherever rights of
way are under construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by the city,
the city may install all such facilities deemed necessary to accommodate future
provider needs. Any such installed facilities shall be city property and may be
conveyed to any person under such terms and conditions as are deemed advisable
by the city.
   (O)   Chapter headings. Chapter headings are for convenience only and shall
not be used to interpret any portion of this chapter.

§ 1232.01 INTENT.
   (A)   There exist in the city blighted areas of a nature defined in this
chapter, which areas constitute a serious and growing problem injurious and
inimical to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the residents
thereof. The existence of such areas:
      (1)   Contributes substantially and increasingly to losses by fire and
accident, necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public
funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime
prevention, correction, execution and punishment, for the treatment of juvenile
delinquency, for the maintenance of adequate police, fire and accident
protection and for other public services and facilities;
      (2)   Constitutes an economic and social liability; and
      (3)   Substantially impairs and arrests the sound growth of the
community.
   (B)   This problem is beyond remedy and control solely by regulatory
processes and the ordinary operation of private enterprise without the aids
provided in this chapter. The elimination in whole or in part of blighted
areas, the acquisition and preparation of land in, or necessary to, the
redevelopment of those areas and its sale, lease or other disposition for
development or redevelopment in accordance with the redevelopment plans of the
city, and any assistance which may be given in connection therewith, are public
uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and private property
acquired by purchase, by donation and by eminent domain and are governmental
functions of concern to the city.
   (C)   The necessity, in the public interest and general welfare, for this
chapter is hereby declared to be a matter of legislative determination.

(`82 Code, § 1232.05) (Ord. 86-77, passed 10-7-86; Am. Ord. 94-79, passed 8-16-
94)
§ 1232.06 ACTION BY COUNCIL; HEARINGS, NOTICE.
   (A)   Council shall either approve, modify or reject the urban renewal or
redevelopment plan after it has held a public hearing at which an opportunity
has been provided to all interested persons to be heard either in person or by
counsel.
   (B)   Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the city once a week for two consecutive
weeks, with the first publication at least 14 days prior to the date set for
the public hearing. Such notice shall contain a description of the project area
by its location in relation to highways, streets, streams or other landmarks
and shall state that maps, plats and other material describing the urban
renewal or redevelopment plan are available for public inspection at a place to
be designated in such notice. If the project area includes ten or less parcels
of land, as listed on the current tax duplicate, written notice of the public
hearing, with similar contents, shall also be mailed, by first class mail, at
least seven days before the date set for the public hearing, to the last known
owner of each such parcel of land or to the last known address of such owner as
shown by the records of the City Auditor.

will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the needs of the locality as a
whole, for the redevelopment of the project area by private enterprise; and
      (3)   That the redevelopment plan is feasible and conforms to the general
or master plan, as it then exists, for the overall development of the city.
   (E)   The approval by Council of the urban renewal or redevelopment plan
constitutes authority to spend general tax revenues appropriated for such
property and the proceeds of bonds issued for such purpose and to accept gifts,
donations and grants from the United States, the state, any entity,
instrumentality or subdivision of either or any other entity or person.

§ 1232.07 MODIFICATION OF PLAN.
   An urban renewal or redevelopment plan may be modified by Council at any
time. Any proposed modification which contemplates an extension of the project

disposal of such land shall prescribe, in detail, the terms, conditions and
manner in which such sale is to be made and the covenants to be contained in
the instruments of conveyance from the city to the redeveloper. Such terms,
conditions or covenants shall not contain any restrictions based upon race,
creed or color. Pending the use or sale of property in the project area, the

§ 1232.09 PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM TAXES AND FROM LEVY AND SALE BY VIRTUE OF
EXECUTION.
   (A)   All property of the city, including funds owned or held by it for
purposes of this chapter, shall be exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an
execution, and no execution or other judicial process shall issue against the
same, nor shall judgment against the city be a charge or lien on such property.
However, this section shall not apply to or limit the right of obligees to
pursue any remedies for the endorsement of any pledge or lien given pursuant to
this chapter by the city on its rents, fees, grants or revenues from urban
renewal projects.
   (B)   The property of the city, acquired or held for the purpose of this
chapter, is declared to be public property used for essential public and
governmental purposes, and such property shall be exempt from all taxes of the
city, the county, the state or any political subdivision thereof. However, such
tax exemption shall terminate when the city sells, leases or otherwise disposes
of such property in an urban renewal or redevelopment area to a purchaser or
lessee who is not a public body entitled to tax exemption with respect to such
property.
      (C)   In any urban renewal project, the City Council may agree that the
owners of the improvements shall make semi-annual urban renewal service
payments in lieu of taxes upon the improvements during an exemption period, to
be determined by the Council at such time equivalent to the taxes which would
have been paid on the portion of the valuation of the improvements which are
declared at such time to be a public purpose. Any such service payments shall
be collected at the same time and in the same manner as real property taxes are
collected. The entire amount of these service payments shall be deposited into
an urban renewal debt retirement fund established pursuant to this chapter.
Such payments may be agreed upon between the city as owner of the improvements
and any lessee of such improvements.
   (D)   Any urban renewal project initiated by the city, may, at the
discretion of the City Council, be partially or completely funded by urban
renewal bonds which shall be payable from the revenues derived from the urban
renewal project; or by issuing unvoted urban renewal bonds which pledge the
full faith and credit of the city which may also pledge and be payable from any
or all of the revenues derived from the urban renewal project; or may issue
unvoted urban renewal bonds pursuant to Article VIII, Section 13 of the Ohio
Constitution in order to create and preserve jobs and employment opportunities
and improve the economic welfare of the city, which shall pledge and be payable
from the revenues derived by the urban renewal project.
   (E)   An urban renewal project authorized pursuant to this chapter may be
funded by any other manner which is lawful pursuant to the home rule powers of
the city.

§ 1232.10 SEPARABILITY; CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative intent, it is
declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any provision of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the application of such provision to
persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid shall
not be affected thereby.
   (B)   Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the
provisions of any other law, the provisions of this chapter shall control. The
powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to the
powers conferred by any other law.

Administrator, or his or her authorized representative in the enforcement of
this zoning code.
         (b)   Authorize such variances, upon appeal, from the terms of this
zoning code as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to the

unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this code shall be observed and
substantial justice done. Procedures for variances shall conform to §
1244.12.
         (c)   Appeals taken on the basis of a decision rendered by the
Planning Commission on conditional use requests.

(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.05 APPEALS TO THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be made by any interested party
aggrieved. INTERESTED PARTY as used in this section shall mean the appellant
(applicant) and all persons entitled to notice under division (D) below. Such
an appeal shall be made as follows:
   (A)   Appeals shall be made to the BZA by filing with the BZA a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof.
   (B)   If an appeal is being made as a result of action by the Zoning
Administrator, it must be made within 30 days from that action.
   (C)   All documentation, in whatever form, constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken shall be transmitted to the BZA.
   (D)   The BZA shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give ten days notice by first class mail to the parties in interest as well as
to all property owners within 250 feet of the subject property.
   (E)   The BZA shall decide the appeal within 30 days after the hearing. This
time period may be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days if agreed to by
the BZA and applicant.
   (F)   At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by attorney. Any
party adversely affected by a decision of the BZA may appeal within 30 days to
the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas on the grounds that such decision was
unreasonable or unlawful.
      (1)   In exercising the powers specified in §
1244.05, the BZA may , in conformance with this zoning code, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or modify, the order, requirement, decision or determination
appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or determination as
ought to be made. To that end, the BZA shall have all the powers of the officer
from whom the appeal is taken. Before making any finding in a specific case,
the BZA shall:
         (a)   Determine that the proposed change will not constitute a change
in the zoning district map;
         (b)   Consider the following factors:
            1.   The adequacy of light and air to the adjacent properties;
            2.   The increase in traffic and possibility of congestion on
public streets which might result from the proposed change;
            3.   The affect in property values within the surrounding area; and
            4.   The affect on any aspect of the public health, safety, comfort
or general welfare.
         (c)   Every change granted or denied by the BZA shall be accompanied
by a written finding of fact, specifying the reason for granting or denying the
change.
      (2)   The concurring vote of three members of the BZA is necessary to
reverse an order, requirement, decision or determination of the Zoning
Administrator or his or her authorized representative, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter in which the BZA is required to pass under this
zoning code, or to affect any variation in this zoning code.
      (3)   No order of the BZA permitting the erection or alteration of a
building shall be valid for longer than six months, unless a building permit
for such erection or alteration is obtained within such period and such
erection or alteration is started, and proceed to completion, in accordance
with the terms of such permit.
      (4)   No order of the BZA permitting a use of a building or premises
shall be valid for longer than six months, unless such use is established
within such period. However, where such permitted use is dependent upon the
erection or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in force and
effect if a building permit for such erection or alteration is obtained within
such period and such erection or alteration is started, and proceeds to
completion, in accordance with the terms of such permit.
      (5)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the BZA that by reasons
of acts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the Zoning Administrator’s
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the BZA or by the Court of Common Pleas, on notice to the Zoning Administrator
or by judicial proceedings, and on due cause shown.

issuance thereof, shall expire by limitation, and where work is commenced and
then abandoned for one year, the Zoning Administrator or authorized
representative shall order the incomplete structure to be removed by the owner.

additional year, provided that the request is made prior to the expiration of
the first permit and that sufficient information is submitted by the applicant
to justify such extension.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.07 ZONING CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   It shall be unlawful for any owner, lessee, or tenant to occupy any
structure, building or land, or part thereof, hereafter erected, created,

   (A)   No owner shall use or permit the use of any building or premises, or
part thereof, hereafter created, erected, changed, converted on enlarged,
wholly or partly, in its character of use or structure, until a zoning
certificate of occupancy, which shall be a part of the building permit, has
been issued by the Zoning Administrator or authorized representative. Such
certificate shall show that such building or premises, or part thereof, and the
proposed use thereof, are in conformity with this zoning code. It shall be the
duty of the Zoning Administrator or representative, to issue such a
certificate, provided that he or she is satisfied that the building and the
proposed use thereof conform to this zoning code. No permit for excavation or
construction shall be issued by the Zoning Administrator or representative
before he or she is satisfied that the plans, specifications and intended use
conform to this zoning code.

Administrator or representative, a temporary zoning certificate of occupancy
for a part of a building may be issued by him or her.

   (D)   Where there is a transfer of ownership or tenancy of premises (land)
and/or buildings in the Business and Industrial Districts, no owner or tenant
shall use such premises and/or buildings until a zoning certificate of
occupancy has been issued by the Zoning Administrator or representative.
However, this shall not apply to the continuance of the business or industry of
the seller.
   (E)   The fee for a certificate of occupancy is as established by City
Council.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.08 SCHEDULE OF FEES.
   The City Council shall, by ordinance, establish a schedule of fees for
zoning permits, amendments, appeals, variances, conditional use permits, plan
approvals, and other procedures and services pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this code, after considering the recommendations of the
Zoning Administrator with respect to actual administrative costs, both direct
and indirect. The schedule of fees shall be posted in the office of the Zoning
Administrator, and may be altered or amended only by the City Council. Until
all such appropriate fees, charges, and expenses have been paid in full, no
action shall be taken on any application, appeal, or administrative procedure.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.09 PLANS.
   Before a permit is issued for construction, four copies of the site plan at
a scale no smaller than 1 inch to 100 feet shall be filed with the Zoning
Administrator setting forth, identifying and locating the following:
   (A)   Content of plans. All applications for zoning permits shall be
accompanied by four sets of plans, drawn to scale and shall contain the
following as a minimum:
      (1)   The total area in the development;
      (2)   The actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon;
      (3)   The existing zoning of the property in question and/or all adjacent
properties;
      (4)   The exact size and location on the lot of the buildings and
accessory buildings that exist;
      (5)   The lines, or footprints, within which the building or structure
shall be erected or altered;
      (6)   The existing and intended use of each building or parts of
buildings;
      (7)   The number of families or housekeeping units the building is
designed to accommodate;
      (8)   All public and private right-of-way and easement lines located on
or adjacent to the property which is proposed to be continued, created,
relocated or abandoned;
      (9)   The schedule of phasing of the project;
      (10)   The locations of all existing and proposed buildings in the
described parcels, the uses to be contained therein and the total number of
buildings including dimensions, heights, gross floor area and number of
stories; and
      (11)   And any other information with regard to the lot and neighboring
lots as may be necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this
zoning code.
   (B)   Plan review guidelines. The following principles, where applicable,
shall guide the exercise of site plan review:
      (1)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site shall be
incorporated into the plan and the development.
      (2)   Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and in scale with
existing structures and spaces in the area within 250 feet of the development
site.
      (3)   A site that has an appearance of being congested, over built or
cluttered can evolve into a blighting influence and therefore such should not
be congested, over built or cluttered.
      (4)   Open spaces should be linked together.
      (5)   Natural separation should be preserved or created on the site by
careful planning of the streets and clustering of buildings using natural
features and open spaces for separation. Existing vegetation removal should be
kept to a minimum.
      (6)   Screening of intensive uses should be provided by utilizing
landscaping, fences or walls to enclose internal areas.
      (7)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion. Long,
unbroken building facades should be avoided.
      (8)   Street location and design shall conform to existing topographic
characteristics. Cutting and filling shall be minimized in the construction of
streets. Flat as possible grades shall be utilized proximate to intersections.
      (9)   Pedestrian circulation in non-residential areas should be arranged
so that off-street parking areas are located within a convenient walking
distance of the use being served. Handicapped parking should be located as near
as possible to be accessible to the structure. Pedestrian and vehicular
circulation should be separated as much as possible, through crosswalks
designated by pavement markings, signalization or complete grade separation.
      (10)   Path and sidewalk street crossings should be located where there
is a good sight distance along the road, preferably away from sharp bends or
sudden changes in grade.
      (11)   Parking lots and garages should be located in such a way as to
provide safe, convenient ingress and egress. Whenever possible there should be
a sharing of curb cuts of more than one facility. Parking areas should be
screened and landscaped and traffic islands should be provided to protect
circulating vehicles and to break up the monotony of continuously paved areas.
      (12)   Drive through facilities, such as restaurants and banks, should be
located to allow enough automobile waiting space for peak hour operation
without interference with other parking lot circulations.
   (C)   Action by the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Commission for
plan review.
      (1)   Upon submission of a complete application for plan review to the
Zoning Administrator, the application may be transmitted to the Planning
Commission where they shall review the site plan to determine if it meets the
purpose and requirements as established in this Section, of the zoning district
where the proposed or modified use is located, and of any other applicable
section of this zoning code. No public notice or public hearing shall be
required in conjunction with the review, approval, approval with modifications
or disapproval of the site plan.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission shall act upon
all site plans within 30 days after the receipt of the complete application
from the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission
may approve, disapprove, or approve with modifications the site plan as
submitted. Within the said 30 day period, a majority of the members of the
Planning Commission present at a meeting thereof may vote to extend the said
period of time, not to exceed an additional 60 days.
      (3)   The application time period shall be considered to have begun upon
the receipt of a completed application by the Zoning Administrator.

§ 1244.10 ACTIONS BY LAW DIRECTOR.
   In case a building or structure is, or is intended to be, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered or converted, or in case a building,
structure or premises is, or is intended to be, used in violation of or is
contrary to this zoning code, the Law Director is hereby authorized, in
addition to other remedies set forth in this zoning code, to institute an
action to enjoin or proceed with any other appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent such erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion or
use.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.11 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Conditional use permits shall be required for types of uses designated as
conditionally permitted in a particular use district. Such particular use may
be permitted and desirable in certain districts, but not without consideration
in each case of the effect of the use upon neighboring land and the effect the
neighboring land will have on the use. The application of the planning
standards for determining the location and extent of such use is a planning
function, and not in the nature of a variance or appeal. Enumerated throughout
this code are certain uses and the districts in which conditional uses may be
permitted provided the following standards are fulfilled and a conditional use
permit is granted by the Planning Commission.
      (A)   Application contents. The application shall be signed by the owner
or applicant attesting to the accuracy of all information supplied by the
application. At a minimum, the application shall contain the following
information, provided however, that the Zoning Administrator may waive certain
submission requirements where it is determined that it is not applicable:
      (1)   Name, address and telephone number of the owner of record and
applicant;
      (2)   A boundary survey of the said property;
      (3)   A description of existing use;
      (4)   The present zoning district;
      (5)   A description of the proposed conditional use;
      (6)   A plan for the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading areas, traffic access and
traffic circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service areas,
utilities, signs, yards and other such information as the Zoning Administrator
may require to determine if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and
requirements of this code;
      (7)   A statement and supporting documentation describing how the
applicant believes that the request conforms to the standards for conditional
uses listed in division (C) of this section; and
      (8)   An application filing fee as established by City Council.
   (B)   Action on application. The Planning Commission shall hold a hearing
thereon, notice of which may be published in a newspaper of general
circulation, and mailed to the last known address of the owners of the property
within 250 feet of the parcel for which a conditional use permit is requested
at least ten days before the hearing. The application and any reports,
covenants, deeds, plans, or other information requested or required in
conjunction with or as part of the application shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission 30 days prior to the date of public hearing. Failure to
timely submit any of the reports, covenants, deeds, plans or other information
will result in the continuance of the public hearing to a later date,
determined by the Planning Commission, which will allow the Planning
Commission, city officials or advisors to evaluate the reports, covenants,
deeds, plans or other information in time for the hearing to take place.
   (C)   Standards. In determining whether the issuance of a conditional use
permit is warranted, the standards the Planning Commission shall take into
consideration are the following:
      (1)   The use will not discourage the development or impair the value of
the surrounding and adjacent land and use district(s);
      (2)   The concentration and volume of vehicles in connection with the use
will not be more dangerous or hazardous than the usual traffic of the use
district;
      (3)   The proposed use must not produce a negative impact upon the
abutting or surrounding properties and zoning uses given the characteristics,
size, location, intensity and nature of the proposed use and any structure;
      (4)   The location, extent, arrangement and intensity of the proposed use
shall be such that its operation will not be objectionable to adjacent and
surrounding uses by reason of noise, smoke, dust, odors, fumes, vibrations or
glare;
      (5)   The use, arrangement of and location of uses and structures must be
compatible with surrounding uses and zones or must be capable of being made
compatible through the imposition of conditions;
      (6)   The use and structures must not be detrimental to the health,
safety and welfare of the locality involved;
      (7)   The use and structures must conform to the purpose, intent and
objectives of this zoning code; and
      (8)   The proposed use is properly located in relation to any adopted
master plan, general plan, land use plan, thoroughfare plan, or street plan,
particularly in its relation to existing collection and local street systems
and pedestrian circulation.
   (D)   Factors.  
      (1)   Factors to be considered in evaluating the standards set forth in
division (B) of this section may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
         (a)   Land use;
         (b)   Height;
         (c)   Set backs;
         (d)   Business or other activities;
         (e)   Open space;
         (f)   Density;
         (g)   Location of structures and uses on the site;
         (h)   Screening;
         (i)   Signs/advertisements;
         (j)   Paving;
         (k)   Entrances;
         (l)   Hours of operation;
         (m)   Lighting;
         (n)   Landscaping;
         (o)   Fencing/walling;
         (p)   Mechanical systems/HVAC;
         (q)   Dumpster locations; and
         (r)   Parking.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall issue the conditional use permit if
it determines that the proposed conditional use satisfies, or through the
imposition of conditions pursuant to this division (D) satisfies, the standards
set forth in division (B) of this section. If the Planning Commission
determines that such proposed use does not, and with the imposition of
conditions will not, satisfy the standards set forth in division (B) of this
section, Planning Commission shall deny the issuance of a conditional use
permit.
   (E)   Issuance of permit. If the Planning Commission determines that the
issuance of a conditional use permit is warranted, the Planning Commission may
condition such issuance upon specific requirements and limitations with respect
to location, construction, maintenance, landscaping, operation, and other
factors and features of the site or the use it deems necessary or appropriate
to protect the interests of the community and to ensure satisfaction of the
standards set forth in division (B) of this section.
   (F)   Rejection of application. The rejection of an application for a
conditional use permit by Planning Commission constitutes the final
determination of the city. The approval of a conditional use permit shall
become null and void if building permits have not been issued for all buildings
and structures within six months after approval of a conditional use permit.
   (G)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. In granting any conditional
use, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this zoning code. Violations of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use
is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this zoning code.
   (H)   Expiration of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit shall
be deemed to authorize only one particular conditional use and such conditional
use permit shall automatically expire if, for any reason, the conditional use
has ceased by discontinuance or abandonment for a period of more than six
months.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1244.12 VARIANCES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) shall have the power to authorize
variances in specific cases as described herein. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall hear and decide all applications for variances from the strict
application of this zoning code as will not be contrary to the public interest,
and where owing to special characteristics of the property of use, the literal
enforcement of this code would result in unnecessary hardship in the case of a
use variance, or will result in a practical difficulty in the case of an area
variance. In handling variances, it shall be the intent of the Board of Zoning
Appeals to see that the spirit of the zoning code is being observed, public
safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Variances shall not be
granted for uses not permitted in the Zoning District applicable to the
property where a proper resolution would be to rezone the property to
accommodate the requested use. In those cases, an application for rezoning the
property is required.
   (A)   Conditions prevailing. Where there are exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions, and the literal enforcement of the requirements of
this chapter would involve practical difficulty or would cause unnecessary
hardship, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this code, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have power to relieve such hardship. In
authorizing a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach thereto such
conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the
proposed structure or use, as it may deem necessary in the interest of the
furtherance of the purpose of the code and in the public interest. In
authorizing a variance, with attached conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it may deem to be
necessary, to enforce compliance with the conditions attached.
   (B)   Findings of the Board of Zoning Appeals. No such variance of the
provisions or requirements of this chapter shall be authorized by the Board of
Zoning Appeals unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds, that ALL of the
following facts and conditions exist:
      (1)   Exceptional circumstances. Where, by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, or unusual shape of a specific piece of property on
the effective date of this code, or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions, or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of
property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the
piece of property in question, there are exceptional or extraordinary
circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question or to the
intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other properties
or classes of uses on the same zoning district.
      (2)   Preservation of property rights. That such variance is necessary
for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights which are
possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the same
vicinity.
      (3)   Absence of detriment. That the authorizing of such variance will
not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially
impair the purposes of this code or the public interest.
      (4)   Not of general nature. That the condition or situation of the
subject property, or the intended use of the property, for which variance is
sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably
practical the formulation of a general regulations for such conditions or
situation.
   (C)   Application for variance. A variance from the terms of this code shall
not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning Administrator. The
application shall be signed by the owner or applicant attesting to the truth
and exactness of all information supplied by the application. The application
shall contain the following information as a minimum:
      (1)   The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
      (2)   A survey of the property in question by a person licensed in the
State of Ohio to perform land surveys as may be required by the Chief Building
Official or Zoning Administrator;
      (3)   A description of the nature of the variance requested;
      (4)   A statement demonstrating that the requested variance conforms to
the standards set forth in division (B) of this section; and
      (5)   A fee as established by City Council.
   (D)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. In granting any appeal or
variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this code. Violation of such conditions and
safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is
granted, shall be deemed a violation of this code and punishable under
Chapter 1299. Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an
appeal or variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this code
in the district involved, or any use prohibited by the terms of this code in
such district.
   (E)   Public hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall establish a date for a public hearing within ten days after the
receipt of an application for a variance. The hearing on the variance shall be
held within 30 days of receipt of application for the variance.
   (F)   Notice of public hearing in newspaper. Before holding the public
hearing required in division (E) of this section, notice of such hearing shall
be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city prior
to the hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public
hearing and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.
   (G)   Notice to parties of interest. Before holding the public hearing
required in division (E) of this section, written notice of such hearing shall
be mailed by first class mail or hand delivered before the day of the hearing
to the property owner, the petitioner and all property owners located within
250 feet in any direction of the property upon which an application for a
variance has been filed. The failure to mail or deliver the notification as
provided in this code shall not invalidate any such notice.
   (H)   Action by Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)   Within 30 days or as soon thereafter as is reasonable, following
the public hearing required in division (E) of this section, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with supplementary conditions as
specified in division (D) of this section, or disapprove the request for a
variance in writing to the applicant.
      (2)   All documents, plans or other materials submitted to or considered
by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be part of the record of any public
hearing required in division (E) of this section. The Board of Zoning Appeals
may include a staff report submitted to the board in the public record by
accepting such report by majority vote of its members to ensure a complete
record of its proceedings. If the request for a variance is disapproved by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, the applicant may seek relief through the Court of
Common Pleas. Failure to act within 30 days shall not constitute an approval of
the variance.

§ 1273.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Statement of intent. The Reading Design Review Districts are intended
to provide supplemental regulations or design standards pertaining to specific
areas, wherever these are located, in order to provide for clean, visually
appealing and cohesive design elements along the primary roadways in the city.
   (B)   Definition of districts. The Reading Design Review Districts are
defined as geographic areas exhibiting or planned to contain special and
distinctive characteristics that are of significant value or importance to the
public. These characteristics include:
      (1)   Areas exhibiting substantial historical architectural significance
and character;
      (2)   Areas exhibiting physical development features such as substantial
public investment in public improvements or community plans that coordinate
public and private investment along primary gateways and corridors in the city.
   (C)   Purposes.
      (1)   The purposes of the Reading Design Review District regulations are
intended to:
         (a)   Assist the development of land and structures to be compatible
with a larger planning area beyond the immediate vicinity of individual sites;
         (b)   Protect or improve the quality of the built environment;
         (c)   Promote the general health, safety and welfare of the public in
those locations where the characteristics of the environment or the amount of
public investment are of significant public interest and are vulnerable to
damage or loss of public opportunity by the cumulative effect of development in
such planning areas permitted under conventional zoning regulations.
      (2)   Based on the purposes established above, the Reading Design
District regulations are required to protect the public investment and property
owners' investment in the District:
         (a)   From blighting influences that might be incrementally caused,
extended or worsened by the application of conventional land use regulations to
properties and areas of sensitive and special public interest;
         (b)   From significant damage to the economic value and efficiency of
operation of existing properties and/or new developments due to the
interdependence of their visual and functional relationships;
         (c)   From the detrimental cumulative effects of incremental
development decisions in urban centers and commercial corridors on:
            1.   Conservation and correction of the character, integrity,
safety, access and circulation.
            2.   Preservation and enhancement of pedestrian safety and views
from the public right- of-way.
            3.   Balance of convenience and compatibility between residential
and nonresidential areas.
            4.   Coordination of useful and attractive signage and streetscape
elements.
            5.   Minimization of traffic congestion and coordination of land
use intensity with local capacities and goals.
   (D)   Identification. The location of the Reading Design Review Districts
shall be shown on the Zoning Map as individual free-standing districts relating
to the design regulations of this chapter.
   (E)   Applicability. All regulations of the Reading Design Review Districts
shall apply to and control property as identified on the Official Zoning Map.
However, in the case of conflict between the provisions of a specific Reading
Design Review District and other regulations established in this Zoning Code,
the provisions of the Reading Design Review District shall prevail. The
adoption of the Reading Design Review District shall not have any affect on a
previously approved zoning certificate or PUD Plan during the period of
validity of such approval.
   (F)   Creation. City Council may, from time to time, create additional
districts within the Reading Design Review District as defined and containing
the characteristics, as set forth in this chapter.
   (G)   Supplemental Reading Design Review District Regulations.
      (1)   Reading Design Review District standards adopted by City Council
may relax or further restrict previously applied zoning district regulations
for land use, lot area, coverage, density, floor area, setback, parking,
height, fencing, landscaping or other specific development standards for the
Reading Design Review District upon finding that conditions peculiar to such
district and the achievement of adopted community plans require supplemental
design regulations. Any such supplemental regulations shaft be set forth in the
resolution establishing such Reading Design Review District or in an amendment
thereto.
      (2)   For the purposes of this chapter, the term SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSION
shall be any extension, reconstruction or improvement of a structure or
building that equals or exceeds 50% of the gross floor area of the existing
building or structure prior to expansion.
   (H)   Zoning Certificate.

greater flexibility than permitted in established districts.
      (2)   To promote the efficient use of land.
      (3)   To encourage the most skillful planning in the arrangement of
buildings, the preservation of open space, the utilization of topography and
other site features.
      (4)   To obtain creative and coordinated designs harmonious and
compatible with surrounding land uses.
   (B)   The "PDD" establishes procedures that are supplemental to those
applicable in other use districts under which development plans particularly
designed to meet these objectives may be prepared.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1274.02 OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   The "PDD" shall be applied as an overlay district on top of existing
established zoning districts that govern land use, setbacks, site density, and
other land use controls. Provisions of the underlying established district
shall apply unless altered or superseded by Planning Commission and City
Council approval of a "PDD" on a specific parcel or parcels of land. Approval
of a "PDD" and its provisions will be based on the proposed developments
ability to meet the spirit and intent of the purposes for a "PDD" as stated
herein. If the desired land use deviates significantly from the underlying
zone, a zone change in both the underlying zone and a "PDD" must be applied for
at the same time.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)

§ 1274.04 "PDD" REGULATIONS.
   Each "PDD" shall be a separate zone district with regulations specifically
applied to that district with an overlay. Each "PDD" shall be numbered and
boundaries drawn on the zoning map. The regulations are adopted by City Council
after recommendations by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may
adopt regulations specific to that development after review of developers
plans. Regulations may include, but not necessarily limited to:
   (A)   Land and building uses;
   (B)   Land coverage by buildings, building floor area and building heights;
   (C)   Yard setbacks;

use of common access, more suitable for its users, more cohesive in appearance,
and have less impact on the surrounding environment than if the development
were done in accordance with the underlying zoning.
   (E)   The development will not increase traffic congestion or storm water
drainage to a greater extent than development within the provisions of the
underlying zone would.
   (F)   The development will conform to the applicable policies and plans of
the city.
   (G)   The development will contain such proposed covenants, easements and
other provisions relating to the proposed development standards, as reasonably
are required for the public health, safety and welfare.
   (H)   The development shall place all utilities entirely underground.

      (11)   Any modification of the general plan data presented and approved
for the "PDD" applications may be required by the Planning Commission.
   (B)   Planning Commission submittal requirements. Where the "PDD" zoning has
been adopted by the City Council as a result of a Planning Commission
initiative, the final plan submission shall include all elements of the "PDD"
application as may be required by the Planning Commission.
   (C)   Planning Commission action. The following action shall be taken by the
Planning Commission on the final development plan:
      (1)   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review the final development
plan and approve, modify and approve, or disapprove the application for final
approval and transmit notice thereof to the applicant within 35 days of receipt
of the complete final development plan package.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall give the final approval only upon
finding that the following requirements are met:
            1.   The design, size, and use are consistent with the preliminary
development plan and with other applicable plans adopted by the Planning
Commission or City Council.
            2.   The location, design, size, and uses will be adequately served
by existing or planned facilities and services.
            3.   The location, design, size and uses will result in an

(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1276.04 BUFFER AREA MATERIALS AND STANDARDS.
   (A)   New development, changes of use or substantially expanded structures
shall provide buffer areas as provided in § 1276.09. Existing vegetation shall
be preserved, as much as feasiblely possible, in accordance to acceptable
nursery industry procedures.
   (B)   The following items are suitable for screening use individually or in
combination with each other provided they create a dense screen, subject to
review and approval by the Building Commissioner. Nursery stock identification
tags shall not be removed from any planting prior to inspection and approval of
final installation by the city.
      (1)   Walls and fences.
         (a)   When walls or fences are used to fulfill screening requirements,
they shall be detailed on the plan. They are to be constructed of weatherproof
materials. This includes pressure treating or painting of lumber if it is not
redwood or cedar and using aluminum or galvanized hardware. Chain link fences
with or without wooden or synthetic slat material shall not be permitted when
used to satisfy buffering requirements.
         (b)   Any wall or fence used for buffering shall be constructed so
that the finished, or most visually appealing side of the wall or fence, is
facing the adjacent property.
      (2)   Plants. Plant materials used in conformance with the provision of
this chapter shall conform to the standards of the American Association of
Nurserymen and shall have passed any inspection required under state
regulations. Trees shall be balled and burlapped or in containers. Shrubs,
vines and ground covers can be planted as bare root as well as balled and
burlapped or containers. All trees shall be measured from the top of the root
ball to the top of the tree mass.
         (a)   Deciduous trees. Deciduous trees shall have a minimum caliper of
at least two and one-half inches with a single central leader, for large and
medium trees, conforming to acceptable nursery industry procedures at the time
of planting. If deciduous trees are to be used for screening purposes,
additional materials listed in this section must be used to create a dense
buffer.
         (b)   Evergreen trees. Evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six feet
in height at the time of planting and shall be unsheared, full and branched to
the ground. Evergreen plantings shall be designed to provide an effective,
dense screen within four years of planting. It is recommended that evergreen
trees be planted no further than ten feet on center to assure an effective
buffer.
         (c)   Shrubs and hedges. Shrubs and hedges shall be at least 36 inches
in height at the time of planting. All shrubs and hedges shall be designed to
provide an effective, dense screen and mature height of at least five feet
within four years after the date of the final approval of each planting. The
height at installation of the planting shall be measured from the level of the
surface of the plant base at the edge closest to the screening.
         (d)   Grass or ground cover. Grass shall be planted in species
normally grown as permanent lawns in Hamilton County. In swales or other areas
subject to erosion, solid sod, erosion reducing net, or suitable mulch and
temporary seeding shall be used for immediate protection until complete
coverage otherwise is achieved. Grass sod shall be clean and free of weeds and
noxious pests or diseases. Grass shall be sown or placed in any area not
landscaped or paved. Ground cover shall be planted in such a manner as to
provide 75% complete coverage after two growing seasons.
         (e)   Earth mounds. Earth mounds may be used as physical barriers
which block or screen a view. Differences in elevation between areas requiring
screening does not constitute an earth mound. Earth mounds shall be constructed
of earthen materials and shall conform to the following standards:
            1.   The maximum side slope shall be three horizontal to one
vertical and the design shall be reviewed by the Building Commissioner to
ensure that proper erosion prevention and control practices have been utilized.
            2.   Berms and earth mounds shall be designed with physical
variations in height and alignment throughout their length.
            3.   Landscape plant material installed on berms and earth mounds
shall be arranged in an irregular pattern to accentuate the physical variation
and achieve a natural appearance.
            4.   The landscape plan shall show sufficient detail, including a
plan and profile of the berm or earth mound, soil types and construction
techniques to demonstrate compliance with the above provisions.
            5.   Berms and earth mounds shall be located and designed to
minimize the disturbance to existing trees located on the site or adjacent
thereto.
            6.   No part of any berm or earth mound which is elevated more than
30 inches above natural grade shall be located within ten feet of any right-of-
way or property line.
            7.   Adequate ground cover shall be used and maintained to prevent
erosion of the earth mound.
      (3)   Maintenance of buffer areas and landscaping.
         (a)   All landscaping materials shall be installed and maintained
according to accepted nursery industry procedures. The owner of the property
shall be responsible for the continued maintenance of all buffer and
landscaping materials, and shall keep them in a proper, neat and orderly
appearance, free from refuse and debris at all times. All unhealthy or dead
plant material shall be replaced within one year, or by the next planting
period, whichever comes first, by plant material similar in size and type to
that which was removed. The owner or developer must show a proof of maintenance
plan which indicates how the established buffer areas and landscaping will be
maintained.
         (b)   Violation of these installation and maintenance provisions shall
be a violation of this zoning code under
Chapter 1299.
      (4)   Buffer establishment. Once a buffer has been approved by the
Building Commissioner and established by the owner, it may not be used,
disturbed or altered for any purpose.
      (5)   Location of buffer. A required buffer area may be erected in the
required yard as established by this zoning code.

   (A)   Buffering of off-street parking and loading areas.  
      (1)   Whenever a parking area for five or more vehicles or an off-street
loading space is located in, or adjacent to a residential district, or is
adjacent to a religious place of worship, school, or other institution located
on an adjoining lot, it shall be effectively screened on all sides which adjoin
or face any property used for these purposes on adjacent lots. Screening shall
be as follows:
         (a)   Screening shall be by an acceptably designed wall, fence, or
planting screen that is approved by the Building Commissioner.
         (b)   Such fence, wall, or opaque planting shall not be less than
three feet nor more than five feet in height for off-street parking areas and
six feet in height for off-street loading areas. Such fence, wall or opaque
planting shall be maintained in good condition.
         (c)   The space between such fence, wall or planting screen and the
lot line of the adjoining premises in any residential district shall be
landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs, or evergreen ground cover, and maintained
in good condition.
         (d)   The finished face of the fence or wall shall face the adjoining
property.
      (2)   In the event that terrain or other natural features are such that
the erection of such fence, wall or planting screen will not serve the intended
purpose, then the Building Commissioner may allow an exception, so that no such
fence, wall, or planting screen and landscaping shall be required.
   (B)   Interior landscaping of off-street parking areas. Off-street parking
areas containing more than 6,000 square feet of area or 20 or more vehicular
parking spaces, whichever is less, shall provide interior landscaping of the
peninsular or island types of uncompacted, well-drained soil as well as
perimeter landscaping. For each 100 square feet or fraction thereof of
vehicular use area, at least five square feet of landscape area shall be
provided.
      (1)   Interior landscape requirements. Interior landscaping shall be
dispersed throughout the parking area. Landscaping shall be situated such that
large, unbroken areas of pavement are avoided.

square feet, excluding curbs, with a four foot minimum dimension to all trees
from edge of pavement where vehicles overhang.
         (b)   Maximum contiguous area. In order to encourage the required
landscape areas to be properly dispersed, no individual landscape area shall be
larger than 400 square feet in size. The smallest distance to a tree in an
interior landscaped area from the edge of pavement where vehicles overhang
shall be four feet.
      (2)   Minimum tree specifications.
         (a)   In addition to any tree requirements required by the city, a two
inch diameter tree (as measured six inches above ground) shall be planted for
each 3,000 square feet of impervious surface.
         (b)   To retain visibility within the parking area, trees shall have a
clear trunk of at least five feet above the ground. The remaining area shall be
landscaped with shrubs, and/or ground cover, not to exceed three feet in
height.
   (C)   Vehicle overhang. Parked vehicles may hang over the interior
landscaped area no more than two and one-half feet. Concrete or other wheel
stops shall be provided to ensure no greater overhang or penetration in the
landscaped area.
   (D)   Grass and ground cover. Grass or ground cover shall be planted on all
portions of the landscaped areas not occupied by other landscaped material.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)
§ 1276.08 SCREENING OF SERVICE STRUCTURES.
   Service structures shall include but not be limited to loading docks,
propane tanks, dumpsters, electrical transformers, utility vaults which extend
above the ground, ground mounted utility equipment and electrical and other
equipment or elements providing service to a building or a site. The screening
height shall be based upon the tallest point of the structure(s) being
buffered.
   (A)   Location of screening. A continuous planting of evergreen, fence or
wall must enclose any service structure on all sides, unless such structure
must be frequently moved or accessed, in which case screening material shall be
established to allow access to the structure.
   (B)   Curbs to protect screening material. Whenever screening material is
placed around any dumpster or waste collection unit which is emptied or removed
mechanically on a regular basis, a curb to contain the placement of the
container shall be provided within the screening material. The curbing shall be
at least one foot from the material and shall be designed to prevent possible
damage to the screening when the container is moved or emptied.

§ 1286.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate teen clubs through the
application of uniform zoning and licensing requirements to promote the health,
safety, morals and general welfare of the patrons of such clubs and of all
citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations for
the operation of teen clubs because of their nature as permitted uses in areas
of the city that are also zoned for uses deemed by the Council to be
incompatible with teen use, including, but not limited to, sexually oriented
businesses and liquor establishments. It is not the intent of this chapter to
limit or restrict the operation of any club geared toward a teen clientele as
their intended market, but to provide a safe and reasonable manner in which to
operate such clubs.

§ 1290.01 INTENT.
   (A)   Sign regulations, including provisions to control the type, design,
size, location, illumination and maintenance thereof, are established in order
to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
      (1)   To promote attractive and maintain high value residential districts
by permitting only nameplates, bulletin boards and signs related to the
development, rental or sale of properties in such districts;
      (2)   To provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
and advertising goods sold or services rendered in business districts by
relating the size, type and design of signs to the type and size of
establishments;
      (3)   To provide for appropriate signs for the identification and
preservation of industrial development;
      (4)   To control the design of signs so that their appearance will be
aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings and an overall design for the
area;
      (5)   To reduce traffic hazards by restricting signs which exceed the
viewers capacity to receive information or which increase the probability of
accidents created by distracting attention or obstructing vision;
   (B)   ln establishing these objectives the city has determined that, without
adequate regulation and design standards, signs are a nuisance. The number of
signs in Reading is excessive and unduly distracting, and in some cases reduces
the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public. Therefore, the number
of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs permitted should comply
with the standards of the chapter in order to reduce the aforementioned
effects.
      (1)   The signs of least value to the people of Reading are those which
carry commercial messages other than the advertisement of any product, service,
event, person, institution, or business located on the premises where the sign
is located.
      (2)   Except as provided herein, all signs not conforming with the
provisions of this chapter are hereby declared a nuisance. It is further
declared that the regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum
regulations necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the purpose of this
chapter.
      (3)   Signs shall be designed, erected, altered, moved, displayed and
maintained in accordance with the regulations set forth in this chapter. The
provisions of the chapter shall not amend or in any way interfere with the
other codes, rules or regulations governing traffic signs within the city.
(Ord. 2003-51, passed 5-20-03)

No rezoning of land shall be approved prior to specific documents finding at
least one of the following:
      (1)   There has been a change in demand for land which alters the
information upon which the zoning map is based.
      (2)   A study indicates that there has been an increase in the demand for
land in the requested zoning district, and as a result, the supply of land
within the city mapped as such on the zoning map, is inadequate to meet the
demands for such development.
      (3)   Proposed uses cannot be accommodated by sites already zoned in the
city due to lack of transportation or utilities or other development
constraints, or the market to be served by the proposed use cannot be
effectively served by the location of the existing zoning district.
      (4)   There is an error in the code text or zoning map as enacted.
   (B)   No residentially zoned district shall be rezoned to a non-residential
district unless the site proposed for rezoning is contiguous to land in the

findings shall be made by the Planning Commission on each of the following
matters based on the evidence presented.

in compliance with and deviate from adopted plans, goals and policies.

   (A)   The exterior of premises, the exterior of structures and the condition
of accessory structures shall be maintained so that the appearance of such
premises and all buildings thereon reflects a level of maintenance in keeping
with the standards of the immediate neighborhood, so that the appearance of
premises and structures shall not constitute a blighting factor for adjoining
property owners nor an element leading to the progressive deterioration and
downgrading of the immediate neighborhood with the accompanying diminution of
property values. No owner, operator or occupant shall maintain or permit to be
maintained any condition on the exterior of such premises that creates a fire,
safety or health hazard, including, but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Storage of commercial and industrial equipment and material. There
shall not be stored or used at a location visible from the sidewalk, street or
other public area, equipment and materials relating to commercial or industrial

the bulk sale of materials and supplies.
      (2)   Landscaping. Premises shall be maintained. Lawns, hedges and bushes
shall be kept from becoming overgrown and unsightly where exposed to public
view and where the same constitute a blighting factor depreciating adjoining
property and impairing the good character of the immediate neighborhood.
      (3)   Signs. Signs permitted by reason of other regulations or as a
lawful nonconforming use shall be maintained in good repair, and printed
matter, pictures or illustrations contained thereon shall be completely
maintained or, when no longer in use, completely removed. All nonoperative or

exterior walls, parapet walls, decorative additions, chimneys, fences and other
exterior structures, either above or below the roofline, shall be maintained in
a safe condition, weathertight and to resist decay or deterioration from any
cause.
         (b)   Any structure or secondary or appurtenant structure whose
exterior surface is bare, deteriorated, ramshackle, tumbledown, decaying,
disintegrating or in poor repair shall be repaired or razed, as follows:

floors, steps, trim or railings and any missing member shall be replaced and
put in a good and safe condition.
            2.   All replacements shall match and conform to the original
design or be replaced completely.
            3.   All exterior wood or exterior unfinished surfaces shall be
sealed and painted or surface-coated with another approved protective coating
or treated to prevent rot or decay. Such paint, protective coating or treatment
shall conform to and match the existing paint or surface covering and the
original design or replacement thereof. All exterior walls and surfaces shall
be properly protected against the weather where such are defective or lack
weather protection, including a lack of paint or surface covering, or have
weathered due to a lack of proper protective covering.
            4.   The structure shall be maintained free of broken windows,
broken siding, crumbling stone or brick or other conditions reflective of
deterioration or inadequate maintenance in order that the property itself may
be preserved, safety and fire hazards eliminated, and the adjoining properties
protected from blighting influences.
         (c)   Any structure or secondary or appurtenant structure whose
exterior surface deteriorating, decaying or disintegrating, or whose exterior
surface has weathered with dirt and grime or has been impaired through peeling
or flaking of the paint or other protective coating, shall be repaired,
repainted or resurfaced, as follows:
            1.   All exterior surfaces shall be replaced in good condition
preparatory to repainting or coating.
            2.   All bare exterior surfaces which are flaking or crumbling
shall be replaced or sealed in a good and workmanlike manner.
            3.   All new or repaired bare surfaces shall be painted or coated.
            4.   All exterior surfaces weathered with dirt and grime, or which
are peeling or flaking, shall be painted or covered with an approved protective
coating or surface.
         (d)   Presentation of evidence that all exterior surfaces have, not
more than five years prior to the date of inspection, been properly prepared
and painted with at least one coat of good exterior paint or covered with other
approved protective coating or surface shall be prima facie evidence of the
exterior being in good condition.
      (5) Awnings and marquees. Awnings or marquees and their accompanying
structural members which extend over any street, sidewalk or other portion of
the premises shall be maintained in good repair and shall not constitute a
nuisance or a safety hazard. If such awnings or marquees are not properly
maintained in accordance with this division, they shall, together with their
supporting members, be removed forthwith. If such awnings or marquees are made
of cloth, plastic or similar materials, such cloth or plastic, where exposed to
public view, shall be maintained in good condition and shall not show evidence
of weathering, discoloration, ripping, tearing or other holes. Nothing herein
shall be construed to authorize any encroachment on streets, sidewalks or other
parts of the public domain.
      (6)   Natural growth. Dead or broken trees and 1imbs or other natural
growth which, by reason of deteriorating conditions or storm damage,
constitutes a hazard to persons or property and shall be removed from the
premises.

   Every owner and/or occupant shall be responsible for the safe, clean and
sanitary disposal of garbage and rubbish resulting from their occupancy, by
placing it in approved containers or facilities which are sufficient to meet
the needs of such occupancy until removal from the premises. Accumulation of
such waste in occupied areas shall not be permitted as it may constitute a fire
or health hazard or a source of infestation. Composting shall be permitted, if
it conforms with this code in the prevention of odor, pests and infestation.

§ 1426.14 INSPECTIONS.
   Inspections are made by the city solely for the public purpose of enforcing
this code. No representation is made that any order issued pursuant to this
code contains a complete list of all violations which exist on the premises,
nor shall the city accept any responsibility whatsoever to any person, firm, or
corporation for any damage done or injury suffered as a result of poor
workmanship or unserviceability of any work done or materials used pursuant to
such order, or as a result of the failure of any person, firm or corporation to
correct the violations listed therein, or because of any failure to inspect or
failure to order the correction of any condition or for any reason whatsoever.
All owners, occupants, invitees, guests, or other persons using any premises
which have been repaired pursuant to the provisions of this code, shall do so
at their own risk, without remedy against the city, its officers or employees.
   (A)   Residential. Buildings and premises subject to this code are subject
to inspection from time to time by the enforcing officer of the city. At the
time of such an inspection, all exterior parts of premises shall be available
and accessible for such inspection, and the owner, operator and occupant shall
provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspection. Such
inspection shall be made between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., unless

      (2)   In addition to the provisions of this division, the Property
Maintenance Officer may apply to the Municipal Court, upon affidavit, for a
search warrant, setting forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances
that provide a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of
this code exists on the premises. If the Court is satisfied as to the matter
set forth in such affidavit, it may authorize the issuance of a search warrant
permitting access to and inspection of that part of the premises on which the
nuisance or violation exists. A warrant for access may be issued by the Court

the office of the County Auditor, or if the last known address cannot be
ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance of the
building in a conspicuous place.
      (1)   If a registered or certified mail envelope is returned with an
endorsement showing that service was refused, the notice may be served by
ordinary mail to his or her last known mailing address, residence or place of
business. The mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing, and
service shall be deemed complete on the date of mailing. If the registered or

was unclaimed, the notice may be served by ordinary mail to his or her last
known mailing address, residence or place of business. The mailing shall be
evidenced by a certificate of mailing, and service shall be deemed complete on
the date of mailing, provided that the ordinary mail envelope is not returned

      (2)   If service is not accomplished by any of the above means, then a
notification of the existence of the notice and order may be published at least
once in a local newspaper of general circulation in the city.
   (D)   Notice to become an order; hearings. Within ten days of the date of
service of a notice, the notice shall constitute a final order unless the
person affected by the notice requests a hearing thereon before the Board of
Zoning Appeals by serving a written request within the ten-day period, in
person or by mail, on the Chairperson of the Board. Such request shall briefly
set forth the grounds or reasons on which the request for a hearing is based
and the factual matters contained in the notice of violation which are to be
disputed at the hearing. The Chairperson, upon receipt of the request, shall,
within 30 days therefrom and upon five days notice to the party aggrieved, set
the matter for hearing.
   (E)   Determination at hearing. At any hearing provided for under this
section, the Chairperson shall be vested with all the powers provided by law to
compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in interest by the issuance and
service of subpoenas; to require, by subpoena, the production of books, records
or other documents at such hearing which may be pertinent to matters to be
determined by him or her; and to enforce any such subpoena or secure any order
for the enforcement of any such subpoena, as provided by law. The determination
shall be made within ten days from the completion of the hearing. The Board
shall issue an order either incorporating the determinations and directions
contained in the notice, modifying the same or withdrawing the notice.
   (F)   Extension of time. The Property Maintenance Officer may extend the
time for correction or abatement of any violation for an additional period, not
to exceed 30 days, except where major capital improvements or renovations are
involved, in which instance the time for completion may be extended for a
period not to exceed 90 days beyond the expirntion date of the original notice.
   (G)   Noncompliance with notice. Whenever the owner, agent, occupant or
operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with

§ 1426.16 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES OR MODIFICATIONS.
   The Property Maintenance Officer shall have the power to withhold the strict
enforcement of the requirements of this code upon written application therefor
by an owner, occupant or operator, after making a determination that:
   (A)   Any variation or modification of a structure or use approved by the
Property Maintenance Officer will not, in any material way, alter the standards
of this code and cannot affect detrimentally the health, safety or welfare of
the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood;
and strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary hardship on
the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the premises
which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety
or welfare that might be derived therefrom.
   (B)   The owner or operator is without practical or feasible means to comply
with this code.
   (C)   The strict enforcement of this code would require the installation of
repairs and improvements estimated to exceed $500 in cost, and the premises
subject to this code are contemplated for acquisition or are within an area
where acquisition is contemplated by a public agency having the power of
eminent domain; and there is a reasonable likelihood that such premises will be
acquired and razed or moved within a period of two years. However, any waiver
of any of the provisions of this code shall be cancelled and the Property
Maintenance Officer shall strictly enforce the cancelled code if it is
ascertained, after the granting of such waiver, that the premises are, in fact,
not to be acquired for any public use or purpose.

   An application made under §
1426.16 shall not constitute a defense to a charge of violating any of the
provisions of this code concerning proceedings which are pending in the
Municipal Court when the application is filed, nor shall any variance or
modification allowed under this code constitute a vested right against any
ordinance enacted hereafter by Council compelling strict enforcement of this
code.

address of the premises, the variation or modification approved, the date of
approval and the reasons therefor, to satisfy this code, shall be prepared by

set forth in §

without having the right of access to the building or premises through or
across adjoining premises not owned by him or her or under his or her control,
and where the right of access has been refused or where the owner or person

of any person seeking access to secure such adjoining property against damage
to persons or property arising out of such right of access. The amount of the
bond shall not exceed $10,000, unless the Board feels that conditions require a
higher bond. The amount set shall take into consideration the extent, nature
and duration of the repairs, the proximity of the improvement on the premises
affected and the potential risk of damage thereto. The bond shall be filed with
the Property Maintenance Officer.
   (B)   No owner, operator or occupant of adjoining premises shall refuse to

§ 1428.03 FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the city structures used
for residential and nonresidential purposes which are or may become substandard
with respect to structure and maintenance, and that such conditions including,
but not limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, the
appearance of the exterior of the premises and the existence of fire hazards
and unsanitary conditions, constitute a menace to the health, safety, welfare
and reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the city. It is
further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions and initiating slums; that if the same are not
curtailed and removed, such conditions will grow and spread and will
necessitate, in time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to
correct and eliminate the same; and that by reason of timely regulations and
restrictions, as herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be
prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property values thereby
maintained, the desirability and amenities of residential and nonresidential
uses and immediate neighborhoods enhanced and the public health, safety and
welfare protected and fostered.

and operators; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of
residential and nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for violations of
this code; and to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to

§ 1472.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards that increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(`82 Code, § 1472.01) (Ord. 86-89, passed 12-16-86; Am. Ord. 2004-40, passed 4-
27-04)
§ 1472.02 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.

27-04)
§ 1472.03 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences, whether or not such alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which
are  solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be
prohibited by this chapter.

   (B)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, in accordance with §
1472.06, are designated as Zone A on the community's flood insurance rate map.
Within these areas, the Safety-Service Director shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data obtained under §
1472.17(F) in order to administer §§
1472.17)(A) and
1472.18.
   (C)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a community's flood
insurance rate map, regardless of the source of such data, the Flood Plain
Administrator shall:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, of the lowest floor, including the basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor.
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
         (a)   Verify and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean sea
level, to which the structure was floodproofed; and
         (b)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
1472.11(C); and
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter, including base flood elevation data, flood
insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps, variance
documentation, conditional letters of map revision, letters of map revision,
letters of map amendment, and as-built elevations.
   (D)   Alteration of watercourses. The Safety- Service Director shall:
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A watercourse is
considered altered if any change occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in §
1472.11(D) that the flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion
of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for by the
applicant, for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse, so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished.
   (E)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. The Safety-Service Director shall
make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries
of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map
boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood
elevation profile from the Flood Insurance Study shall prevail. The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
1472.15.
   (F)   Alteration of community boundaries. Upon occurrence, the Safety-
Service Director shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
city have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce flood plain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the city's flood
insurance rate map accurately represent the city's boundaries, the Safety-
Service Director shall include within such notification a copy of a map of the
city suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the city has assumed or relinquished flood plain
management regulatory authority.

      (1)   The Appeal Board as established by the city shall hear and decide
appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Appeal Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
that there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Safety-Service Director in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by a decision of the Appeal Board, or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon applications, the Appeal Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property, in times of flood, for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors set forth in division (A)(4) of
this section, and the purposes of this chapter, the Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (6)   The Safety-Service Director shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances may only be issued where, due to physical characteristics
of the property compliance with the requirements of this chapter creates an
exceptional hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the
requirements of this ordinance do not constitute an exceptional hardship.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, provided that the provisions of division (A)(4) of
this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
      (3)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (6)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant;
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense; create
nuisances; cause fraud on or victimization of the public, as identified in
division (A)(4) of this section; or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances; and
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (7)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.

(`82 Code, § 1472.16) (Ord. 86-89, passed 12-16-86; Am. Ord. 2004-40, passed 4-
27-04)
§ 1472.18 FLOODWAYS.
   (A)   Areas with floodways. The flood insurance study referenced in §
1472.06 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in §
1472.14(B). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibited encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development, unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that encroachments would not result in any increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If division (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
1472.16 through
1472.18.
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Safety-Service Director to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must
meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (4)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         (a)   Technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA
within six months of the date such information becomes available. These
development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
1472.17(F).
         (b)   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         (c)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         (d)   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         (e)   Concurrence of the Chief Executive Officer of the city and the
Chief Executive Officer(s) of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
   (B)   Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard where
the Flood Insurance Study provides base flood elevation data as set forth in §
1472.06, but no floodways have been designated, the following provisions apply:
      (1)   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
      (2)   If division (B)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §§
1472.16 through
1472.18.

not relieve this person, firm, or other entity from complying with any local,
state, or federal regulations that address illicit discharges or any other
pollutant discharges. If these minimum standards prove inadequate, it is the
ultimate responsibility of the person, firm, or other entity to provide
additional measures to prevent illicit discharge or other pollutant discharges.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 6, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.06 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than stormwater.
   (B)   The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to
the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
      (1)   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this chapter: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows,
swimming pools (NOTE: swimming pool water may he discharged only if
dechlorinated – below 0.1 milligrams per liter (mg/l) – and complies with the
state Water Quality Criteria for the protection of aquatic life as outlined in
the Ohio Administrative Code 3745-1-07), fire-fighting activities, and any
other water source not containing pollutants as determined by the city.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (C)   Prohibition of illicit connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)   A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection
to continue.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 7, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.07 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (A)   Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city
may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United
States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an
emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United
States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (B)   Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (C)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 8, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.08 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity stormwater
discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of
compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city
prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 9, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.09 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has security measures in force
which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts
of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and
copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to
discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined
by state and federal law.
      (3)   Upon notifying the owner or owner's representative, the city shall
have the right to immediate access to the property to set up on any permitted
facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized
enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge and/or suspected illicit discharge.
      (4)   The city has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the city and shall not be replaced.
The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted
facility, as described in division (B)(3) of this section, are a violation of a
stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized
enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
   (7)   If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from
which stormwater is discharged, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 10, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.10 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL AND REDUCE STORMWATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The city will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for
any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution
or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs.
Further, any person responsible for a property or premises which is or may be
the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said
person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 11, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.11 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately-owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 12, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1496.12 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the United
States, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the phone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or
industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall
also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to
prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three
years.
(Ord. 2005-109, § 13, passed 12-20-05)

§ 1497.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and could increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment
transport and deposits. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased
quantities of water-borne pollutants, stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation
of stormwater runoff from development sites. Buffers adjacent to stream systems
provide numerous environmental protection and resource management benefits
which can include restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and
biological integrity of the water resources; removing pollutants delivered in
urban storm, water; reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation; stabilizing
stream banks; providing infiltration of stormwater runoff; maintaining base
flow of streams; contributing the organic matter that is a source of food and
energy for the aquatic ecosystem; providing tree canopy to shade streams and
promote desirable aquatic organisms; providing riparian wildlife habitat; and
furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity.
   (B)   Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity
policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for
the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water
resources from degradation and to protect and maintain the native vegetation in
riparian and wetland areas. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater
runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and non-point source
pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 1.1, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management
and vegetative buffer requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within
this jurisdiction. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the
following objectives:
      (A)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion, and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
      (B)   Minimize increases in non-point source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
      (C)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable;
      (D)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and non-
point source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls, and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety;
      (E)   Establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of buffers
to protect the streams, wetlands and flood plains of the city; and
      (F)   Protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes,
riparian and aquatic ecosystems, and other significant water resources within
this jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 1.2, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.03 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan
applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city
under the specifications of §§
1497.12 through
1497.14. This chapter also applies to land development activities that are
smaller than one acre if such activities are part of a larger common plan of
development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though
multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at
different times on different schedules. In addition, after initial review by
the Building Inspector, all plans must also be reviewed by the City Engineer to
ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained during and
after development of the site and that post- construction runoff levels are
consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
   (B)   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the city has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing one or
more acre of land. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater
performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the city as applicable.
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single-family structures.
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than one acre of land,
provided they are not part of a larger common development plan.
      (4)   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by
the city.
   (C)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in §
1497.06, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be
governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the most current
edition of the BMP Manual. These criteria are dependent on the amount of
impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality.
Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a
review by the city.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 1.3, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.04 COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER PERMIT AND CHAPTER REQUIREMENTS.
   The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements,
and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from
those imposed by any other applicable ordinance, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher
protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to
take precedence.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 1.4, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.05 DEVELOPMENT OF A BMP MANUAL.
   (A)   The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information,
including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the
requirements of this chapter, and may provide such information in the form of a
BMP Manual.
   (B)   This manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment
practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and
expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local review authority,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance
experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in
accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the
minimum water quality performance standards.

§ 1497.12 WAIVERS FOR PROVIDING STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by
this chapter, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement.
Requests to waive the Stormwater Management Plan requirements shall be
submitted to the city for approval. Waivers from stormwater management
requirements shall not result in development that undermines the purpose of
this chapter as stated in §
1497.02.
   (B)   The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least
one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges (such as low-impact development (LID)) have been
established in a Stormwater Management Plan that has been approved by the city
and the implementation of the plan is required by local ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
stormwater practice.
      (4)   The city finds that meeting the minimum on-site management
requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on-site that reduce: (a) the
generation of stormwater from the site; (b) the size and cost of stormwater
storage; and (c) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural
practices (LID or other) are explained in detail in the most current edition of
the BMP Manual and the amount of stormwater management credit available for
using such practices determined by the city.
   (C)   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the Safety-
Service Director, after consultation with the City Engineer, may grant a waiver
from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as
acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a
waiver, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the
waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
      (1)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
      (2)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
      (3)   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
      (4)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life or
property.
   (D)   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater
management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by
meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the jurisdictional
stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   The purchase and donation of privately- owned lands, or the grant
of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These
lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide
permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat;
      (2)   The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage
improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that
currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the purposes and standards of this chapter;
      (3)   Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management
activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation
studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates),
stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic
studies and monitoring of stormwater management practices.

§ 1497.13 FEE IN LIEU OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   (A)   Where the city waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management
requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate
stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the
applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the city.
   (B)   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater
management, the monetary contribution required shall be established by the
city, and based on the cost estimate for the cubic feet of storage required for
stormwater management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program
project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any
building permit for the development.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 4.2, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.14 DEDICATION OF LAND.
   In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the
required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for
the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be
used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The
agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the
recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of
the building permit.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 4.3, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.15 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the city to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
   (A)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate
stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (B)   New development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into
a jurisdictional wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where
such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional
values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the city. In no case
shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army
Corps of Engineers (ACE) or the city staff responsible for natural resources.
   (C)   For new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall
be designed to remove 80% of the average annual post-development total
suspended solids load (TSS) that is 2 mm or smaller. It is presumed that an STP
complies with this performance standard if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQV) (see the
BMP Manual for calculations and requirements);
      (2)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in
the local BMP Manual for water quality;
      (3)   Constructed properly; and
      (4)   Maintained regularly.
   (D)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (E)   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as hotspots, may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (F)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the city to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
   (G)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the Rules and
Regulations of the Public Works Department Governing the Design, Construction,
Operation, Maintenance and Use in the County of Hamilton Storm Drainage System
(hereinafter referred to as County Storm Drainage Regulations) http://
www.hamilton-co.org/pubworks/ sds_regulations.asp shall be used for sizing all
stormwater quantity management practices.
   (H)   All new development and redevelopment plans shall, at a minimum,
maintain the existing forested buffers along all streams on-site.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 5, passed 12-20-05)

Drainage Regulations are met, unless the city grants the applicant a waiver or
the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
   (B)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city
reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.

(Ord. 2005-108, § 6.7, passed 12-20-05)
§ 1497.23 NON-STRUCTURAL STORMWATER PRACTICES.
   The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in
order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of
reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned
through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of
stormwater and/or pollutants from the site. These non- structural practices are
explained in detail in the most recent edition of the BMP Manual and applicants
wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural practices must ensure that
these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property
owners.
(Ord. 2005-108, § 6.8, passed 12-20-05)
