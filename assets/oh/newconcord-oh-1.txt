ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO.
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH, AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of New Concord, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, Be it Ordained by the Council of the Village of New Concord,
State of Ohio:
   SECTION 1. That the ordinances of the Village of New Concord, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of New Concord,
Ohio, 2018.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Fiscal Officer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of New Concord,
Ohio.
   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to November 26, 2018, which are inconsistent with any provision
of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of
this Ordnance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued on incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor.
For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall continue in full force
notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.

      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)   The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street or
public way.
      (8)   The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)   The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)   Any legislation enacted subsequent to November 26, 2018.
   SECTION 3. That all legislation enacted subsequent to November 26, 2018,
which amended, replaced or otherwise affected a material provision of those
ordinances existing prior to November 26, 2018, shall be deemed to amend,
replace or affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified
Ordinances as reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as
otherwise indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
   SECTION 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and to avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

acknowledgement by the Mayor without consent of the Council.
Rule 22. Referral to Committee
There are times when a matter brought before Council will be referred to the
appropriate standing
committee upon recommendation of the Mayor or any Member and with the consent
of the majority of Members. The same process is followed when a special
committee is recommended. In both cases, the committee will follow the rules as
specified in Section II, Council Committees. Council may direct the committee
to submit a written report or recommendation to the full Council within a
specified timeframe.
Rule 23. Referral to Committee of the Whole
There are times when a matter brought before Council will be referred to the
Committee of the Whole by recommendation of the Mayor or any Member and with
the consent of the majority of Members.
This is a meeting of the entire Council as a committee, but instead of the
usual Presiding Officer in charge, a chair chosen by The Mayor will preside.
The designated chair shall inform the Clerk or Designee, who shall inform the
public in advance of the time and place of the meeting. Referral to this
committee may take place when a major situation or problem arises in which the
Council wants to ensure the participation of all Council Members and discussion
in the regular Council meeting would consume too much time and interfere with
the regular order of business. The Committee of the Whole will act as a
committee, discuss the question as a group, and receive the views and opinions

CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
171.01   Deputy Clerk.
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
171.01 DEPUTY CLERK
   (a)   The Village may employ a Deputy Clerk for the Mayor’s Court.
 
   (b)   The Deputy Clerk shall receive bond monies, fines, forfeitures and
costs at the direction of the Mayor, keep financial records thereof, deposit
the funds in the bank, prepare necessary reports, pay over said sums according
the law, and in general do any and all things necessary and proper thereon.

   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this Section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this Section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Ordinance to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for
the purposes of this Section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this Section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
Section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051 of this Ordinance.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this Section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this Section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
Ordinance, the exception from withholding requirements described in division
(B)(1) of this Section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this Section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this Section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this Section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this Section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Ordinance. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this Section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051 of this Ordinance.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this Section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

withheld.

         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent

each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this Section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

      (1)   “Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this Section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this Section, "wages, salaries, and

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this Section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

solicitation or promotion.
            (Ord. I-9-17-2. Passed 9-11-17.)
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the

      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.

real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this Section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,

taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that

taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03 of this Ordinance, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this Section must be made in the first year following the last

required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

this Ordinance to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Ordinance, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts
of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net
profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss

on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the

purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Ordinance, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Ordinance, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Ordinance by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in

"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that Section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

an affiliated group.

paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

(d) of this Section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this Section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this Section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this Section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section

182.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
182.081 CREDITS AND LIMITATIONS.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the
tax paid to the other municipality. Subject to division (B) of this Section,
the credit shall not exceed the tax due Municipality under this Ordinance.
   (B)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this Section, "the income,

tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this Section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
Section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this Section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this Section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this Section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
Section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this Section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this Section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Ordinance.
 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.

refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this Section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this Section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this Section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
Ordinance, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this Section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Ordinance applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Ordinance, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Ordinance prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this Section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
Section. (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
   (I)    (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this Ordinance is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
         (Ord. I-9-16-1. Passed 9-13-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Ordinance shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this Section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Ordinance, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Ordinance and of
the Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052 of this Ordinance.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Ordinance.
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this Ordinance.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for    the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be
considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this Section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this Ordinance relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this Section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this Ordinance during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this Section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this Section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this Section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this Section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this Section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this Ordinance. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)
(a) of this Section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
Section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this Section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this Section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
Section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this Section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this Section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Ordinance is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Ordinance must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this Section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19 of this Ordinance has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
182.19 of this Ordinance for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this Section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Ordinance. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
Section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this Section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this Section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Ordinance.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this Section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Ordinance.

an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this Section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this Section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

182.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)

182.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions
necessary and appropriate to implement the provisions of this Ordinance,

by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers
referred to in this division of this Section shall be exercised by the Tax
Administrator only in connection with the performance of the duties
respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this Ordinance;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
   (C)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

   (D)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this Ordinance;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

      (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this Section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Ordinance for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Ordinance. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this Section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Ordinance shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this Section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this Ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Ordinance, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Ordinance.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this Section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Ordinance.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
Section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Ordinance for a violation of 182.15 of this Ordinance, and any
other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by law.
         (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Ordinance and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This Section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this Section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
Section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Ordinance.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
Section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Ordinance.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this Section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this Section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this Section.
   (G)    This Section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this Section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this Section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this Section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this Section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
Section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this Section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this Section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Ordinance 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this Section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this Section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this Section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this Section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this Section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this Section.
      (2)   As used in this Section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Ordinance. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Ordinance.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Ordinance, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
182.096 of this Ordinance, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this Section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Tax Administrator
may recommend the adoption of rules by the legislative authority by ordinance
or resolution to facilitate the administration of the income tax imposed by the
Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this Section shall be published and posted
pursuant to Code.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.21 RENTAL PROPERTY NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   Within thirty (30) days after a new tenant occupies rental property of
any kind within the Municipality, the owner of such rental property shall file
with the Tax Administrator a report showing the name, address, and telephone
number, if available, of each such tenant.
Within thirty (30) days after a tenant vacates rental property located within
the Municipality, the owner of such a vacated rental property shall file with
the Tax Administrator a report showing the days of vacation from the rental
property and identifying each such vacating tenant along with a forwarding
address.
   As used herein, the term "rental property" shall include houses, apartments,
rooms, stores, and any other real property rented, leased or demised to a
tenant or lessee.
   (B)   Failure to comply with Section (A) shall constitute a minor
misdemeanor.
(Ord. I-12-15-1. Passed 12-14-15.)
182.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF ORDINANCE.
   (A)   This Ordinance shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this Ordinance are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this Ordinance have

   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section "private residential property" means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)    Unlicensed Vehicle: order to Cover. License or Remove: Notice. For
the purposes of this section, "unlicensed motor vehicle" means a motor vehicle
which does not display a current motor vehicle license on the rear thereof, or
a current validation sticker on the rear license thereof, which is parked or
stored in the open on private property for more than fifteen days with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property.
   The Chief of Police or Chief's designee, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, or personal service, to the person having the
right to the possession of the property on which an unlicensed motor vehicle is
left, that within fifteen days of receipt of the notice, the unlicensed motor
vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure, licensed, or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave an unlicensed motor vehicle uncovered or
unlicensed, in the open for more than fifteen days after receipt of a notice as
provided in this section. The fact that an unlicensed motor vehicle is so left
is prima facie evidence of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each
subsequent period of thirty days that an unlicensed motor vehicle continues to
be so left constitutes a separate offense.
   (c)    Exceptions.
      (1)    Any owner, operator or lessee of a parcel of property within the
City who is duly licensed to sell new or used cars upon said premises or a
legitimate automobile salvage yard operation, with fencing as defined, shall
not be subject to the provisions of this section which relates to storage of
motor vehicles, junk vehicles on private property.
      (2)    Unlicensed vehicles operable and operated solely within the
confines of commercial or agricultural premises titled to and used by the
owner, lessee, person, firm or corporation occupying said commercial or
agricultural premises shall not be subject to the provisions of this section
provided, however, said vehicles are not permitted to stand or remain parked
closer to the street or highway than the front building line, if a building has
been constructed on said premises, or within 100 feet of a street or highway if
said premises are void of buildings.
   (d)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65; Ord. 2024-5-1. Passed 5-13-24.)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

   (b)   Penalties. Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
this Traffic Code shall be imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both,
which term of imprisonment and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person

331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United

a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal

permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any

The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court

subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.

501.09.
   
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the

substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,

high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial

      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC

   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
 
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
 
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
 
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
 
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
 
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
 
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
 
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:

conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:

would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
         2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to

   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is

909.01 CITATION.
   The chapter shall be known and cited as the Village Sidewalk Program
Ordinance.
(Ord. G-9-18-1. Passed 9-10-18.)
909.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the repair and maintenance of
public sidewalks in order to keep them in a proper and safe condition for
public use; to provide for the imposition of liability upon abutting land
owners for injuries or damages caused by a defective sidewalk; to provide
standards of proper sidewalk maintenance, repair and construction; to provide
for partial funding of sidewalk repairs, replacement or construction from
Village funds, as available; and to provide indemnification of the Village for
costs of required maintenance and repair not accomplished by abutting or
adjacent land owners.
(Ord. G-9-18-1. Passed 9-10-18.)
909.03 REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The owner or owners of all lots and premises within the Village of New
Concord are required to maintain, repair and keep safe sidewalks adjacent to or
upon their lots and premises in or along the Public Street and alley rights-of-
ways in the Village.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of all owners of premises within the Village of
New Concord to keep all cement, bricks, asphalt, concrete walks and sidewalks
which have been heretofore or hereafter laid in front of, upon, or adjacent to
such premises, in or along any of the street or alley right-of-ways, in good
repair and free of dangerous ice, snow, or other dangerous obstructions and/or
conditions. Any owners of any such premises who shall allow any such sidewalk
to remain in disrepair or in a dangerous condition shall be responsible and
liable for injuries and damages arising out of the disrepair or unsafe
condition of said sidewalk. Such owner shall further indemnify and reimburse
the Village for any and all liability, costs and expenses that the Village may
incur as a result of any such defective or dangerous sidewalk.
(Ord. G-9-18-1. Passed 9-10-18.)
909.04 SIDEWALK PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following shall govern the maintenance, repair and replacement of public
sidewalks in the Village:
   (a)   Contents.
      Program
      Sidewalk Condition
      Program Implementation
      Expansion Opportunities
      Care and Repair Methods
      Sidewalk Specifications
   (b)   Program.
      (1)   The Sidewalk Program for New Concord defines the system by which
the Council can improve the Village's pedestrian network with a partnership of
public funds and private landowners' responsibility.
      (2)   The public sidewalks are a pathway to school, stores, work, and
leisure activities. As a part of the transportation network, sidewalks reduce
congestion, reduce pollution, encourage increased neighborhood interaction and
promote healthier lifestyles, enhancing the quality of life. Within the Village
of New Concord, the public sidewalk link with the sidewalks on the Muskingum
University campus and the East Muskingum School District campus to form an
extensive network for the entire community.
      (3)   All sidewalk repair or maintenance, as well as replacement, within
the program will provide for handicapped accessibility and be of durable and
safe surface. Opportunities for new sidewalk sections to fill current gaps in
the network or expand the pedestrian paths into areas that have a need for
connectivity and pedestrian safety are recognized and will be considered for
funding as funds are available on an annual basis.
   (c)   Sidewalk Condition.
      (1)   The goal is to make sidewalks safe for pedestrians and to help
prevent injuries caused by defective sidewalks.
      (2)   When sidewalks crack and break, it creates hazards for pedestrians.
Many people have trouble crossing damaged sidewalks and this program helps to
minimize these hazards through sidewalk maintenance and replacement.
      (3)   The Village Council recognizes the need to make repairs or replace
numerous sections of sidewalk throughout the Village as captured in the 2006
field inventory as well as deterioration that has occurred since that study was
completed. As explained in the 2006 field inventory sidewalk condition fits
into three categories: good, poor and fair.
      (4)   A sidewalk in good condition is considered the best condition. It
exhibits a durable, level surface with few minor defects, if any. Acceptable
defects are tight cracks, shallow spalding and very minor displacement at
joints. Broken pavement, if any, is found in inconsequential locations.
      (5)   A sidewalk in fair condition is generally acceptable but can have
major defects in spots. The defects are large, but level cracks, some
unevenness in the joint alignment (not more than 1 inch), large areas of
spalding surface, and broken pavement parts than can even be missing. In places
soil and vegetation encroach on the edges minimizing the width and walkability.
Often in this fair condition category defects occur in only one segment of the
concrete sidewalk, with the remaining length of sidewalk in good condition.
      (6)   A sidewalk in poor condition has many severe defects. Sometimes
these occur in only a few segments along a property, but are significant enough
that they render the length unsafe. The cracking is wide and multiple, the
displacement at points is uneven to the point of over one inch out of level,
and broken/missing pieces form holes that increase the hazard and instability
for pedestrians. Even vegetation grows into a tripping hazard where it fills
breaks within the pavement.
      (7)   In the Sidewalk Program maintenance and replacement of sidewalk
defects would focus mostly on those sidewalks in poor condition or sidewalks in
fair condition where pedestrian volume is high.
   (d)   Inventory Data. The Village of New Concord sidewalk inventory from
2006 may be used as a reference but current conditions and pedestrian volumes
shall be an essential factor in rating repair or replacement necessity. A new
or updated sidewalk study should be considered as a future project for the
Village.
   (e)   Program Implementation.  
      (1)   Implementation is a partnership between the landowner and the
Village, to meet the needs of the community as a whole.
      (2)   The Village leadership, staff or landowners may bring a section of
sidewalk in need of replacement or repair to the Village Administrator, or
designee, for consideration under the Sidewalk Program.
   (f)   Expansion Opportunities.
      (1)   Beyond the repair or replacement opportunities detailed in the
Sidewalk Program, expansion opportunities can connect neighborhoods without
sidewalks to the Village system promoting safety and increasing the quality of
life.
      (2)   Streets without continuous sidewalks can be reviewed for filling
these sidewalk gaps. On some streets the sidewalk shifts mid-street from one
side to the other, forcing pedestrians to cross the street to continue to
utilize the sidewalk.
      (3)   The 2015-2016 Pedestrian Safety and Access Report identifies
numerous gaps in the Village sidewalk system and makes suggestions for
improvements, such as new sidewalk sections, crosswalks or improved signage or
lighting. This report, as well as investigation of the current situation,
should be utilized to make decisions regarding expansion of the sidewalk
network.
   (g)   Care and Repair Methods.
      (1)   In places minor repair work can deem an entire length of sidewalk
in good condition.
      (2)   Adjacent landowners have many methods of caring for their stretch
of sidewalk. A first step in care is trimming grass and weeds from the paved
edges and cracks. The second step is filling cracks as they form and open.
Concrete by nature continues to expand and contract after pouring and will
likely develop some cracks, especially at the tooled joints. If sloping ground
exists, the third care step is to keep side fill dirt in place, so the sidewalk
will not drop from erosion or instability. Finally, leaves, debris, and snow
should be removed as needed.
      (3)   Repair can be as simple as a small batch of bag mix as advised by
the Village staff to fill holes, large cracks and uneven areas. If the
underlying pavement is less than four inches of concrete, it may be wiser, for
durability, to replace the entire segment that is deficient. In some cases, an
uneven joint can be sawed down to level. When a larger stretch is uneven, the
hydraulic concrete leveling technique, or other like techniques, can be used to
bring the walk up to level.
   (h)   Sidewalk Specifications.
      (1)   A standard construction specification will promote uniformity and
predictability to the quality and price of the sidewalk program.
      (2)   Every new sidewalk pavement will meet the guidelines described in
the Village Sidewalk Guidelines in order to create safety, uniformity, and
durability to the Village sidewalk network. In the interest of uniformity, a
standard concrete sidewalk is generally the preferred material.
      (3)   However, exposed aggregate concrete finish is an equally desirable
choice, especially next to areas already using this finish. Installation of
pavers, brick, or stone surface may only be used when approved by the Village
Administrator, or designee. This is to assure quality installation and
durability where this material is desired to enhance or delineate special
construction. Asphalt is not to be used for permanent neighborhood sidewalks.
Please see Attachment A - Sidewalk Program Specifications for additional
information regarding repair, replacement and construction of sidewalks within
the Village of New Concord.
         (Ord. G-9-18-1. Passed 9-10-18.)
909.05 OWNER-CAUSED DEFECTS.
   (a)   Where sidewalk defects, creating pedestrian hazards, are caused by
conditions existing upon an abutting property, such as, but not limited to:
      (1)   Trees or other growth
      (2)   Surface drainage
      (3)   On-site construction or vehicular traffic
      (4)   Other on-site activities
   (b)   The abutting property owner shall be responsible for its repair,
maintenance and/or safe condition, and liable for all consequential injuries,
damages, expenses or costs resulting from the condition and lack of repair or
maintenance and unsafe condition. Such liability shall include full
indemnification for the Village of New Concord for any damages, costs or
expenses resulting from such owner defaults as well as liability to others. The
foregoing liability and responsibility shall apply without notice or hearing on
the same.
(Ord. G-9-18-1. Passed 9-10-18.)
909.06  TREES.
   In repairing, replacing or constructing any sidewalks, no person shall
remove, alter or damage any tree in the public right of way, easement, or

909.08  COST SHARE.
   (a)   The Village may grant property owners 50% of the cost for the repair
and/or replacement of a public sidewalk.
      (1)   The Village will act as the project manager for sidewalk repair or
replacement projects and will obtain quotes from approved contractors for any
work to be done to ensure the highest quality at the best price.
      (2)   Landowners may have the option of paying the Village directly for
their share of the project or it can be assessed on their individual property
taxes.
   (b)   Property owners who wish to contract directly for sidewalk repair/
replacement or complete the work themselves must adhere to Attachment A -
Sidewalk Program Specifications. These projects are eligible to receive 25% of
the total cost reimbursed by the Village, should reimbursement funds be
available, upon satisfactory completion to be determined by the Village
Administrator, or designee.
      (1)   Property owners requesting to be reimbursed for directly contracted
work or work completed by the property owner must contact the Village
Administrator prior to beginning any work. If reimbursement funds are available
the Village Administrator will notify the property owner that, pending a
satisfactory final inspection, they may eligible for reimbursement and may
begin sidewalk work.
      (2)   Property owners must be able to provide original invoice and proof
of payment or itemized receipts showing materials used in construction or
repair of sidewalk. All information must be provided to the Village
Administrator in advance of reimbursement by the Village. All sidewalks must
receive a satisfactory final inspection before any funds are reimbursed to the
property owner by the Village.

   (a)   Findings and Purpose.
      (1)   The Municipality is vitally concerned with the use of all Rights of
Way within the corporation limits as such Rights of Way are a valuable and
limited resource which must be utilized to promote the public health, safety,
and welfare including the economic development of the Municipality.
      (2)   Changes in the public utilities and communication industries have
increased the demand and need for access to Rights of Way and placement of
facilities and structures therein.
      (3)   It is necessary to comprehensively plan and manage access to, and

   (c)    No Construction Without a Certificate of Registration. Following the

remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to
abating the nuisance; taking possession of the Facilities and/or non-complying
portion of such System; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing Providers and Permittees to place Facilities
in the Rights of Way, the Municipality shall not be liable for any damages
caused thereby to any Provider’s Facilities that are already in place or that
shall be placed in the Rights of Way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Municipality.
No Provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this Chapter as creating a
special duty to any Provider.
   (g)    Discontinuance of Operations, Abandoned and Unused Facilities.
      (1)    A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any System in the Municipality shall:
         A.   Provide information satisfactory to the Municipality that the
Provider's obligations for its System in the Rights of Way under this section
and any other sections in the Code have been lawfully assumed by another
Applicant and/or Provider; or
         B.   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner
that promotes the Municipality's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited Rights of Way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Municipality Engineer; or
         C.   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Municipality Engineer must approve said proposal; or

System in a manner acceptable to the Municipality within a reasonable amount of
time if the Municipality believes that there exists a reasonable justification

in accordance with O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its Facilities to the Municipality. If a Provider proceeds under
this clause, the Municipality may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the Facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to C.O. § 97.17(B), require the Provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient
to reimburse the Municipality for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred
in removing the Facilities.
      (2)    Facilities of a Provider who fail to comply with this Section and
which remain Unused Facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Municipality may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to:

         B.   Taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of O.R.C. 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         C.   Requiring removal of the Facilities by the Provider or by the
Provider's surety.
      (3)    If the Municipality requires a Provider to remove Unused
Facilities in any Rights of Way, the Municipality shall use reasonable efforts
to direct that this removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled
excavations of the Rights of Way. If the Municipality abates the nuisance it
may take all action necessary to recover its costs and to abate said nuisance,
including but not limited to, those methods set forth in O.R.C. 715.261.
   (h)   Nature of Issuance. A Certificate of Registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the Rights of Way. A Certificate of Registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy Rights of Way in the
Municipality, for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the
Certificate of Registration and in accordance with Chapter
917. The rights to occupy the Right of Way may not be subdivided or subleased;
provided, however, that two or more Providers may collocate Facilities in the
same area of the Rights of Way so long as each such Provider complies with the
provisions of Chapter
917. Collocating Providers may file a joint application for a Construction
Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from obtaining
appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before co-locating its
Facilities on Facilities of others, including the Municipality's Facilities. A
Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from leasing space in
or on the Provider’s System, so long as the sharing of Facilities does not
cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of Chapter
917. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from complying
with any provisions of the Code or other applicable Law.
   (i)    Other Approvals, Permits, and Agreements. In addition to a
Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and all regulatory
approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or
provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state and local
authorities and upon the Municipality’s reasonable request, shall provide
copies of such documents to the Municipality. Further, a Certificate of
Registration issued pursuant to Chapter
917 shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere with,
the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires, fiber,
cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever under the
management or control of the Municipality.
   (j)    Rules and Regulations. The Municipal Engineer may propose, and
Council may adopt (and from time to time amend) the Rules and Regulations
regarding Chapter
917, Construction standards and occupancy requirements of the Right of Way.
Such Rules and Regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of any
provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in any
way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of Rules and
Regulations increasing Fees; the requiring of the placement of Facilities in
designated portions of the Rights of Way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of Facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the Rules and Regulations, the Municipality shall
provide written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via United States Regular Mail, to each Provider who holds a then
current Certificate of Registration. Each Provider shall then have thirty (30)
days following the date of the Municipality’s mailing to provide written
comment regarding the proposed language to the Municipality. At least forty-
five (45) days, but not more than sixty (60) days following the date of the
Municipality’s mailing, the Municipality shall schedule and hold a meeting, to
make available a forum at which all then current Providers may address any
questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the proposed new
Rules and Regulations to the Municipality. The Municipality Engineer shall,
following said meeting and the review of the Providers’ comments and
suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and Regulations in a manner that best
serves the Municipality, for approval by Municipality Council
(Ord. 2021-31. Passed 4-12-21.)

requirements, the Provider may appeal the denial of the Municipality Engineer
to the Mayor. (Ord. 2021-31. Passed 4-12-21.)
917.04 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Construction and Major Maintenance Plan. Each Provider shall, when
requested by the municipality, file a Construction and Major Maintenance Plan
with the Mayor. Such Construction and Major Maintenance Plan shall be provided
for specific geographical areas requested by the municipality, up to and
including the entire geographical area of the Municipality. It shall be
submitted using a format(s) mutually agreeable to the Provider and the
Municipality and shall contain the information determined by the Municipality
to be necessary to facilitate the coordination and reduction in the frequency
of Construction in the Rights of Way. The Construction and Major Maintenance
Plan shall include, but not be limited to, all currently scheduled and/or
anticipated Construction projects for the next calendar year, if none are
scheduled or anticipated then the Plan shall so state. The Provider shall use
its Best Efforts in supplying this information and shall update the
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan on file with the Municipality whenever
there is a material change in scheduled and/or anticipated Construction
projects. In an effort to assist Providers with the completion of their annual
Construction and Major Maintenance Plan, the Municipality, as soon as possible,
will send each Provider's System Representative a descriptive narrative (and
any mapping information reasonably available) for all the planned Right of Way
improvements and/or scheduled maintenance that the Municipality then currently
intends to undertake during the calendar year.
   (b)    Mapping Data. With the filing of its Application for a Certificate of
Registration, a Provider shall be required to accurately inform the
Municipality of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right
of Way the Provider’s System then currently occupies. With the filing of its
Application for a Certificate of Registration, a Provider may voluntarily
provide such mapping data to demonstrate accurately the general location of its
system within the public right of way. The municipality reserves the right to
create its own public way inventory map and may recover the cost of creation
through the Registration process.
   (c)    Exemption from Disclosure. A Provider shall notify the Municipality
if the Provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document
being submitted to the Municipality is exempt from the public records
disclosure requirements of O.R.C. 149.43. The notification shall be in writing

believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a Provider, the Municipality will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of O.R.C. 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the
Municipality will endeavor to use reasonable Best Efforts to notify the
Provider of the request prior to making the document available for inspection
or copying.

      (1)    Each year the municipality shall calculate all actual and incurred
costs associated with Rights of Way management, administration and control for
the previous calendar year that the Municipality was not able to reasonably
recover through Construction Permit Fees or other recovery mechanisms provided
for in Chapter
917.
      (2)    Providers and Applicants, as required in Section
917.04(b), shall accurately inform the municipality upon application for a
Certificate of Registration, when requested by the municipality or when changes
occur, of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of Right of Way
the Provider’s System then occupied as of the immediately previous December
1st.
      (3)    The Municipality shall total the entire number of miles of Right
of Way reported as being used or occupied by all Providers.
      (4)    The Municipality shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
Section
917.05(a)(1) by the total number of miles of Right of Way reported as being
used or occupied by all Providers as referenced in Section
917.05(a)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)    The Municipality shall then multiply each Provider’s mileage
calculation as referenced in Section
917.05(a)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in Section
917.05(a)(4). The product shall be a Provider’s then current annual
Registration Maintenance Fee.

Registration Maintenance Fees after January 1. Registration Maintenance Fees
shall be invoiced to Providers during the first quarter of each calendar year
and shall be due thirty (30) days following receipt.

the purposes of providing Cable Service, Video Services Provider operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing Video Services, and providers of Open
Video System services, which compensate the Municipality under other mechanisms
in an amount equal to or greater than the Annual Registration Maintenance Fee
that would normally be required for their Right of Way use in The Municipality,
shall have the mileage of the Right of Way they use and/or occupy included in
the calculations described in Section
917.05, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of Rights of
Way Costs as defined by Chapter
917 with the exception of Permit Costs.
      (8)    The Municipality shall charge an individual Utility for any
expense that can be attributed solely to that Utility. This charge shall be
specifically identified on the Annual Registration Fee Invoice and not used in
the annual Registration Fee calculations.
      (9)    The Municipality may by separate legislation enacted by Municipal
Council on or about April 1st of each year, in accordance with the results of
Section
917.05(a)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual Registration
Maintenance Fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous year’s Registration Maintenance Fee (per mile). Revised Registration
Maintenance Fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (b)    Timing. Registration Maintenance Fees shall be paid in full for the
first year of the registration as a condition of the Certificate of
Registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective date
of the Certificate of Registration to the end of the calendar year if less than
one (1) full year.
   (c)    Taxes and Assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of Municipality property as a result
of a Provider's use or occupation of the Rights of Way, the Provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to Chapter
917 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees and
charges listed in Chapter
917. The Registration Maintenance Fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or other
assessment except as specifically provided in Chapter
917, or as required by applicable Law.
   (d)    Interest on Late Payments. In the event that any Registration
Maintenance Fee is not paid to the Municipality by January 31, the Provider
shall pay a monthly late charge of one percent (1%) of the unpaid balance for
each month or any portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (e)    No Accord and Satisfaction. No acceptance by the Municipality of any
Registration Maintenance Fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
Registration Maintenance Fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Municipality may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. 2021-31. Passed 4-12-21.)

cell facilities and wireless support structures in the municipality quickly,
effectively, and efficiently so that residents, businesses, and visitors
benefit from ubiquitous and robust wireless service availability;
      (5)    Establish an application process and structure for payment of fees
and charges to be uniformly applied to all applicants, operators and owners of
small cell facilities and wireless support structures for such facilities;
      (6)    Comply with, and not conflict with or preempt, all applicable
state and federal laws, including without limitation Section 101(a) and Section
704 of the Telecommunications Act, Pub. L. 104104, 101 Stats. 56, 70 (Feb. 8,
1996) (codified as 47 U.S.C. §§ 253(a), 332(c)(7)), as may be amended or
superseded, and Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation
Act, Pub. L. 112-96, 126 Stat. 156 (Feb. 22, 2012) (codified as 47 U.S.C. §
1455(a)), as may be amended or superseded, and all FCC rules and regulations to
interpret and implement applicable federal statutes.
         (Ord. 2021-31. Passed 4-12-21.)
917.06.02 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)    Subject to the Ohio Revised Code and approval of an application under
this section, an operator may collocate a small cell facility and construct,
maintain, modify, operate, or replace wireless support structures in, along,
across, upon, and under the municipality right-of-way.
      (1)   An operator shall comply with generally applicable standards that
are consistent with this section and any rules, regulations, and design
guidelines adopted by the municipality for the collocation of a small cell
facility and construction, maintenance, modification, operation, or replacement

municipality right-of-way, unless otherwise prohibited by state or federal law.
      (2)    All wireless support structures and small cell facilities shall be
constructed and maintained so as not to impede or impair public safety or the
legal use of the right-of-way by the municipality, the traveling public, or
other public utilities.
   (b)    The permitting procedures and authorizations set forth herein shall
apply only to small cell facilities and wireless support structures in the
right-of-way, and do not authorize the construction and operation of a wireline
backhaul facility.
   (c)    Relationship to other sections. This section shall supersede all
conflicting requirements of other titles and sections of this Code regarding
the locating and permitting of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the right-of-way.

917.06.04 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS.
   (a)    Permit Application Review Timeframes.
      (1)    Collocation of Small Cell Facilities on Existing Wireless Support
Structures. The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
collocate, or to replace or modify a small cell facility on, or associated
with, an existing wireless support structure not later than ninety days after
the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)    New Wireless Support Structures and Associated Small Cell
Facilities. The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
construct, modify, or replace a wireless support structure associated with a
small cell facility within the right-of-way not later than one hundred twenty
days after the date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (3)    Wireless Support Structure and/or Small Cell Facilities Removal.
The municipality shall grant or deny its consent for requests to remove
wireless support structures associated with small cell facilities from the
right-of-way typical to the review timeframes for the General Right-of-Way
Permit required for this activity.
      (4)    Eligible Facilities Request. The municipality shall approve
Eligible Facilities Requests in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 4939,
47 C.F.R. §1.40001, and not later than sixty days after the date of filing by
an entity of a submitted application.
   (b)    Failure to Grant or Deny Within Prescribed Timeframes. If the
municipality fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section
or a request for a relevant work permit within the timeframes required,
provided the time period is not tolled or extended with the written consent of
the applicant and the Mayor, the request shall be deemed granted upon the
requesting entity providing notice to the municipality that the time period for
acting on the request has lapsed.
   (c)    Application Denials.  
      (1)    The municipality shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent
for small cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-
way.
      (2)    If a request for consent is denied, the municipality shall provide
in writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)    Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the
municipality, for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to
any person based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical,
and managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   
   (d)    Tolling of Required Timeframes.
      (1)    The time periods required in this section may be tolled only:
         A.   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and the
municipality;
         B.   In cases where the municipality determines that the application
is incomplete; or
         C.   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth this section due to
the lack of resources of the municipality, then the municipality may toll the
time limits as follows:
            1.    The time period may be tolled for up to twenty-one (21) days
for each group of fifteen (15) small cell facility or wireless support
structure requests received by the municipality based on date of receipt by the
municipality.
            2.    In no instance shall the municipality toll the time period
for any small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than
ninety consecutive days. Upon request, the municipality shall provide an
operator written notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless
support structure request.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the municipality shall
provide written notice to the person requesting consent not later than thirty
(30) days after receiving the request, clearly and specifically delineating all
missing documents or information. The missing documents or information shall be
reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the requirements of
applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness requiring other
information or documentation, including information of the type described in
section 4939.0313 of the Ohio Revised Code or documentation intended to
illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for the
request, in accordance with state and federal law, does not toll the time
period for incompleteness.
      (3)    The time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the
entity makes a supplemental submission in response to the municipality’s notice
of incompleteness.
      (4)    If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the municipality shall
notify the entity not later than ten (10) days after receiving the supplemental
submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information
identified in the original notice that delineated missing documents or
information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices under the procedures identified in divisions (1) to (3) of this
section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing
documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.
   (e)    Consolidated application for multiple small cell facilities and/or
wireless support structures.
      (1)    Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace
more than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure
may file, at the applicant’s discretion, a consolidated application for up to
thirty (30) small cell facility requests or up to thirty (30) wireless support
structure requests in a single application and receive a single permit for the
construction, modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell
facilities or wireless support structures subject to the following:
         A.   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         B.   The municipality may separately address small cell facility
collocations or wireless support structures for which incomplete information
has been received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
section 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code and in separate fee ordinances may
be cumulative. However, the municipality, at its discretion may opt to reduce
such fees in order to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)    In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell
facility or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified,
collocated on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for
purposes of tolling the response deadline as authorized under section 4939.036
of the Ohio Revised Code and this chapter. A request by a single operator for a
new or replacement wireless support structure and associated small cell
facility constitutes one request.
   (f)    Timeframe for Completion of Permit.
      (1)    Collocations of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures and the construction of new wireless support structures and/or
associated small cell facilities for which permits have been granted shall be
completed by the operator or its agent within one hundred eighty (180) days
after issuance of the permit, unless:
         A.   The municipality and the operator agree to extend this period; or
         B.   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipality-owned
wireless support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial
power or backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            1.    The operator has made a timely request within sixty (60) days
after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            2.    The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If divisions (f)(1)A. and B. of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the municipality grants an extension in writing to
the operator.
   (g)    Small Cell Facility and Wireless Support Structure activities not
requiring consent.
      (1)    Municipality consent shall not be required for either of the
following activities conducted in the right-of- way:
         A.   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
         B.   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the municipality’s current design requirements and
guidelines and that are either:
            1.    Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
            2.    The same size or smaller than the existing wireless
facilities.
      (2)    The Municipality may require a Right-of-Way Construction Permit
for any activity described in division (f)(1) of this section and for any
activity for which consent is authorized herein and in accordance with state
and federal law if such work involves blocking any access to the right of way
or roadways, including the use of traffic control measures required by the
municipality or other relevant laws.

so long as the information, materials, or requirements do not conflict with
state or federal law.
   
   (d)    The Mayor shall have authority to update or supplement the Design
Guidelines to address relevant changes in law, technology, or administrative
processes.
   (e)    Where the municipality has designated an underground corridor,

applicable and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in
evaluating the Construction Permit application.
   (c)    Issuance of Permit; Conditions.
      (1)    If the Municipality determines that the Applicant has satisfied
the requirements of Chapter
917 and the Construction Permit process, the Municipality shall issue a
Construction Permit subject to the provisions of Section
917.13(c)(2).
      (2)    The Municipality may impose reasonable conditions upon the
issuance of the Construction Permit and the performance of the Permittee
thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure
the structural integrity of the Rights of Way, to protect the property and

inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (d)    Construction Permit Fees.
      (1)    The Municipality shall annually calculate Construction Permit Fees
and appropriately revise any prior year’s Construction Permit Fees based upon
the formula and calculations described in Section
917.13(d). Construction Permit Fees shall remain in effect until the
Municipality’s next annual modification of the Construction Permit Fees.
      (2)    The Municipality, during the first quarter of each year, shall
calculate all the actual and incurred Construction Permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
Rights of Way that will result from Construction that takes place therein.
"Degradation and the reduction in the useful life" for the purpose of this
Section means the accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way caused by
Construction in or disturbance of the Rights of Way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such Rights of Way earlier than would be required if the
Construction did not occur.
      (3)    The Municipality, shall total all the Construction Permit Fee
receipts received in accordance with the scheduled fees required by the prior
year’s Construction Permit Fees for the previous calendar year.
      (4)    The Municipality shall divide the calculated costs referenced in
Section
917.13(d)(2) by the total Construction Permit Fees received as referenced in
Section
917.13(d)(3) to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous years
cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)    The Municipality shall multiply the then currently codified
Construction Permit Fees by the numerical factor as referenced in Section
917.13(d)(4) to calculate revised Permit Fees for the new calendar year .
      (6)    The Municipality shall act, in accordance with the results of
Section
917.13(d)(5), to codify new annual Permit Fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous years Permit
Fees. Revised Permit Fees shall be effective upon passage. Any Permit requests
pending on the date of any annual Permit Fee modification shall be subject to
all new Permit Fees as modified.
      (7)    Except as provided in subsection Section
917.13(d)(8), no Construction Permit shall be issued without payment of
Construction Permit Fees except to the Municipality which shall be exempt.
Construction Permit Fees that were paid for a Permit that the Municipality has
revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of Section
917.10 or
917.16(e) are not refundable.
      (8)    The Mayor may permit a Provider to make quarterly or annual
payments of Construction Permit Fees based upon the Provider’s financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly or annual payments shall be
due and payable within thirty (30) days of invoicing by the municipality. The
Mayor may revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late
payment, or other just cause.
   (e)    Joint Applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
Applications for Construction Permits to work in the Rights of Way at the same
place and time. Joint Applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
Construction Permit Fees.
(Ord. 2021-31. Passed 4-12-21.)
917.14 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
    (a)    Utility Engineering Study Required.
      (1)    Prior to commencement of any initial Construction, extension, or
relocation of Facilities in the Rights of Way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like Facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Municipality) or another Permittee, a Permittee
shall conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of Construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Municipality Engineer. Where such
Construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
Permittee located within the Rights of Way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all Best Efforts to cooperate and assist any other Permittee or
person who is directed by the Municipality to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         A.   Secure all available "as-built" plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all Facilities along
the proposed Construction route.
         B.   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
Facilities along the proposed Construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         C.   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
Underground Facilities the Applicant or Person on whose behalf the Permit was
applied for owns or controls in the Rights of Way along the proposed System
route. Upon request of the Municipality Engineer, a Permittee shall also record
and identify the general location of all other Facilities in the Rights of Way
along the proposed System route. For the purposes of this Section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other Facilities in the Rights of Way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other Facilities in the Rights of Way.
         D.   Where the proposed location of Facilities and the location of
existing Underground Facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with Section
917.14(a)(1)D., Permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
Underground Facilities, or re-designing the Construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Municipality Engineer, a Permittee
shall not excavate more than a Twelve (12) inch hole in the Rights of Way to
complete this task for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be
immediately repaired by the Permittee. A minimum of two (2) Working Days notice
shall be provided to the Municipality prior to performing these investigations.
         E.   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed System design to avoid the need
to relocate other Underground Facilities.
      (2)    The Engineer may modify the scope of the utility engineering study
as necessary depending on the proposed Construction plans.
   (b)    Copy to Municipality. Upon completion of the tasks described in
Section
917.14(a), the Construction Permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled in
accordance with the requirements of Section
917.06(b), the proposed System route maps and Construction Plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the Provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Municipality. The mapping data is only required for the Municipality to
reasonably determine the location of the Provider’s facilities in the Rights of
Way. The Provider shall supply the mapping data on paper if the Municipality
Engineer determines that the format currently being used by the Provider is not
capable of being read by the Municipality.
   (c)    Qualified Firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the Permittee if in the discretion of the
Municipality Engineer the Construction Permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (d)    Cost of Study. The Permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with
Section
917.14(a) to (c).
   (e)    Construction Schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in Chapter
917 or in the Rules and Regulations, or unless the Municipality Engineer waives
any of the requirements of this Section due to unique or unusual circumstances,
a Permittee shall be required to submit a written Construction schedule to the
Municipality not less than five (5) Working Days before commencing any work in
or about the Rights of Way, and shall further notify the Municipality not less
than two (2) Working Days in advance of any excavation in the Rights of Way.
This Section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances
under Section
917.16(d)(1) (Emergency Situations) and Section
917.15 (Minor Maintenance).
   (f)    Location of Facilities.
      (1)    The placement of new Facilities and replacement of old Facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable Laws and the Municipality’s Rules and Regulations. Detailed plans
and applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Municipality for review
and approval prior to construction of any Facilities except those that are
categorized as “Minor Maintenance” issues as per Section
917.15 herein.
      (2)    The Municipality shall have the power to prohibit or limit the
placement of new or additional Facilities within the Rights of Way if the Right
of Way is Full. In making such decisions, the Municipality shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users of the Rights
of Way, but shall be guided primarily by considerations of the public health,
safety and welfare, the condition of the Rights of Way, the time of year with
respect to essential Utilities, the protection of existing Facilities in the
Rights of Way, future Municipality and County plans for public improvements,
development projects which have been determined to be in the public interest
and nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral treatment among Providers.
   (g)    Least Disruptive Technology. All Construction or maintenance of
Facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the Rights of Way. Specifically, every Permittee when
performing underground Construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize Trenchless
Technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface Rights of Way pursuant to Chapter
917 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no cable,
wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to Chapter
917 using "direct bury" techniques.
   (h)    Special Exceptions. The Municipality may grant a special exception to
the requirements of Section
917.14(f) and (g) if a Permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written
evidence that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the Permittee's Construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the Permittee to provide Services in the Municipality.
      (3)   The Permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the Permittee in favor of another Person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the Municipality herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the Permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Municipality.
   (i)    Relocation of Facilities.
      (1)   A Provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its Facilities in the Rights of Way
whenever the Municipality finds it necessary to request such removal and
relocation. In instances where the Municipality requests removal and/or
relocation, the Municipality shall waive all applicable Construction Permit
Fees. Upon removal and/or relocation, the Provider shall restore the Rights of
Way to the same or better condition it was in prior to said removal or
relocation. If existing poles are required to be removed and/or relocated, then
the existing poles will be replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In
accordance with Law, the Municipality may request relocation and/or removal in
order to prevent unreasonable interference by the Provider's Facilities with:
         A.   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Municipality.
         B.   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the Rights of Way.
         C.   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a Right of Way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Provider who has Facilities in the
Rights of Way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Municipality, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with O.R.C. 723.04.01.
      (3)    If, in the reasonable judgment of the Municipality, a Provider
fails to commence removal and/or relocation of its Facilities as designated by
the Municipality, within thirty (30) days after the Municipality's removal
order, or if a Provider fails to substantially complete such removal, including
all associated repair of the Rights of Way of the Municipality, within twelve
(12) months thereafter, then, to the extent not inconsistent with applicable
Law, the Municipality shall have the right to:
         A.   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the Facilities
belong to the Municipality with all rights of ownership, including, but not
limited to, the right to connect and use the Facilities or to effect a transfer
of all right, title and interest in the Facilities to another Person for
operation; or
         B.   Authorize removal of the Facilities installed by the Provider in,
on, over or under the Rights of Way of the Municipality at Provider's cost and
expense, by another Person; however, the Municipality shall have no liability
for any damage caused by such action and the Provider shall be liable to the
Municipality for all reasonable costs incurred by the Municipality in such
action; and
         C.   To the extent consistent with applicable Law, any portion of the
Provider's Facilities in, on, over or under the Rights of Way of the
Municipality designated by the Municipality for removal and not timely removed
by the Provider shall belong to and become the property of the Municipality
without payment to the Provider, and the Provider shall execute and deliver
such documents, as the Municipality shall request, in form and substance
acceptable to the Municipality, to evidence such ownership by the Municipality.
   (j)    Pre-Excavation Facilities Location.
      (1)    Before the start date of any Rights of Way excavation, each
Provider who has Facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its Facilities.
      (2)    All Providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its Facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (k)    Rights of Way Restoration.
      (1)    The work to be done under the Permit, and the Restoration of the
Rights of Way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the Permit. In addition to its own work, the Permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the Code and
Rules and Regulations. If a Permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of Rights of Way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the Permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
Engineer, and complete the restoration of the Rights of Way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Municipality.
      (2)    In approving an Application for a Construction Permit, the
Municipality may choose either to have the Permittee restore the Rights of Way
or alternatively to restore the Rights of Way itself if the Permittee has in
the past not abided by requirements of Chapter
917.
      (3)    If the Municipality allows a Permittee to restore the Rights of
Way, the Permittee may at the time of Application for a Construction Permit be
required to post a Construction Bond in an amount submitted by the Permittee
with a detailed cost breakdown to the Municipality Engineer for approval that
is sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the Rights of Way to its
approximate pre-excavation condition. If, twelve (12) months after completion
of the Restoration of the Rights of Way, the Municipality determines that the
Rights of Way have been properly restored, the surety on the Construction Bond
shall be released.
      (4)    The Permittee shall perform the work according to the standards
and with the materials specified by the Municipality. The Municipality shall
have the authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the Restoration, and
may do so in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case
basis. The Municipality in exercising this authority shall be guided by the
following standards and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of
the excavations, disruptions or damage to the Rights of Way; the traffic volume
carried by the Rights of Way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the
Rights of Way; the pre-excavation condition of the Rights of Way; the remaining
life expectancy of the Rights of Way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of Restoration to the Permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the Rights of Way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
Rights of Way; and the likelihood that the particular method of Restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the Rights of Way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of Restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the Rights of Way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the Rights of Way affected by the work.
      (5)    By restoring the Rights of Way itself, the Permittee guarantees
its work and shall maintain it for twelve (12) months following its completion.
During this twelve (12) month period, it shall, upon notification from the
Mayor, correct all Restoration work to the extent necessary using the method
required by the Municipality Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be
completed within five (5) calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the
Mayor, unless otherwise extended by the Mayor.
      (6)    If the Permittee fails to restore the Rights of Way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Municipality, or fails to satisfactorily
and timely complete all repairs required by the Municipality, the Municipality,
at its option, may do such work. In that event, the Permittee shall pay to the
Municipality, within thirty (30) days of billing, the Restoration cost of
restoring the Rights of Way and any other costs incurred by the Municipality.
Upon failure to pay, the Municipality may call upon any bond or letter of
credit posted by Permittee and/or pursue any and all legal and equitable
remedies.
      (7)    If the work to be done under the Permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Municipality and/ or
another Permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the Restoration
responsibility among the Municipality, Providers and/or other Persons.
   (l)    Damage to Other Facilities.
      (1)    In the case of an Emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the Provider seeking a timely response, when the
Municipality performs work in the Rights of Way and finds it necessary, as may
be allowed by Law, to maintain, support, or move a Provider's Facilities to
protect those Facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that
Provider and shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of billing.
Upon failure to pay, the Municipality may pursue all legal and equitable
remedies in the event a Provider does not pay or the Municipality may call upon
any bond or letter of credit posted by the Permittee and pursue any and all
legal or equitable remedies. Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of
repairing any damage to the Facilities of another Provider caused during the
Municipality’s response to an Emergency occasioned by that Provider’s
Facilities.
      (2)    Each Provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Municipality-owned Facilities in the Rights of Way which the Provider or its
Facilities damage.
   (m)    Rights of Way Vacation.
      (1)    If the Municipality sells or otherwise transfers a Rights of Way
which contains the Facilities of a Provider, such sale or transfer shall be
subject to any existing easements of record and any easements required pursuant
to O.R.C. 723.041.
   (n)    Installation Requirements. The excavation, backfilling, Restoration,
and all other work performed in the Rights of Way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Municipality Engineer.
   (o)    Inspection. When the Construction under any Permit hereunder is
completed, the Permittee shall notify the Municipality.
      (1)    The Permittee shall make the Construction site available to the
Inspector and to all others as authorized by Law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the Construction.
      (2)    At the time of inspection, the Inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the Permit and/or Chapter
917.
      (3)    The Inspector may issue an order to the Permittee for any work
which does not conform to the Permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the Permit. The order may be served on the Permittee as
provided in Section
917.19(b). An order may be appealed to the Municipality Administrator. The
decision of the Municipality Administrator may be appealed to the Mayor whose
decision shall be final. If not appealed, within ten (10) days after issuance
of the order, the Provider shall present proof to the Municipality
Administrator that the violation has been corrected. If such proof has not been
presented within the required time, the Mayor may revoke the Permit pursuant to
Section
917.16(e).
   (p)    Other Obligations.
      (1)    Obtaining a Construction Permit does not relieve Permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary Permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other Laws.
      (2)    Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all Laws,
including the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)    Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all
applicable Laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the
Rights of Way pursuant to its Permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)    No Rights of Way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an Emergency as outlined in Section
917.16(d)(1).
      (5)    Permittee shall not obstruct a Rights of Way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Municipality Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)    Private vehicles other than necessary Construction vehicles may
not be parked within or adjacent to a Permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a Permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the Permit.
   (q)    Undergrounding Required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where Service Facilities are now located underground and where the
Service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any Service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such Service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by Chapter
917, a Provider shall locate Facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of Facilities underground
is consistent with the Provider’s normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical Facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A Provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the Municipality, always use Best Efforts to
place Facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and Facilities
installed), all Facilities to be installed by a Provider under the Right of Way

         H.   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and damage
to the Rights of Way, against the benefits to that part of the public served by
the expansion into additional parts of the Rights of Way; and/or
         I.   Whether such Applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three (3) years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of Chapter
917 or, if applicable, any other Law.
      (2)    Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within twelve (12) months after construction completion or a

      (1)    Each Provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Municipality Administrator of any event regarding its Facilities which it
considers to be an Emergency. The Provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the Emergency. Within five (5) business
days, unless otherwise extended by the Municipality Engineer, after the
occurrence or discovery of the Emergency (whichever is later), the Provider
shall apply for the necessary Permits, pay the fees associated therewith and
fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance
with Chapter
917 for any and all actions taken in response to the Emergency. In the event
that the Municipality becomes aware of an Emergency regarding a Provider's
Facilities, the Municipality shall use Best Efforts to contact the Provider or

comply with all of the requirements of Chapter

   (e)    Revocation of Permits.
      (1)    Permittees hold Permits issued pursuant to the Code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Municipality reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any Permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any Law, or any provision or condition of
the Permit. A substantial breach by Permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         A.   The violation of any provision or condition of the Permit; or
         B.   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
Permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Municipality or its citizens; or

Section
917.14(o)(3).

has committed a substantial breach of a term or condition of any Law or any
condition of the Permit, the Municipality Administrator shall serve a written
demand upon the Permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that
continued violations may be cause for revocation of the Permit. Upon a
substantial breach, as stated above, the Municipality Administrator may place
additional or revised conditions on the Permit.
      (3)    By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, Permittee shall contact the Municipality
Administrator with a plan, acceptable to the Municipality Administrator, for
its correction. Permittee's failure to so contact the Municipality
Administrator, or the Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan, or
Permittee's failure to reasonably implement the approved plan, shall be cause
for immediate revocation of the Permit.
      (4)    If a Permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, Permittee's Permit will automatically be revoked and the Permittee will
not be allowed further Permits for up to and including one (1) full year,
except for Emergency repairs.
      (5)    If a Permit is revoked, the Permittee shall also reimburse the
Municipality for the Municipality's reasonable costs, including Restoration
costs and the costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in
connection with such revocation.

apply), a Provider shall deposit with the Municipality and maintain an
irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety bond in an amount equal
to or greater than one hundred thousand dollars (US$100,000.00), the
Municipality shall make all reasonable efforts to allow Provider a period of

917.17(b), Provider may deposit with the Municipality an irrevocable,
unconditional letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of five million
dollars (US$5,000,000.00). Unless a Construction default, problem or deficiency
involves an Emergency or endangers the safety of the general public, the
Municipality shall make all reasonable effort to allow Permittee a period of

repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to Municipality’s attachment of
the letter of credit or surety bond.
   (d)    Self Bonding. Any provider regulated by the Public Utilities

bonding purposes of this ordinance.
   (e)    Purposes.
      (1)    The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to the

917; and
         B.   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Municipality

subcontractors from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of
any kind arising out of the Construction, presence, installation, maintenance,
repair or operation of its Facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or

defending any action on behalf of the Municipality, shall be entitled to assert
in any action every defense or immunity that the Municipality could assert in
its own behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but

legal fees, costs and expenses assumed by the Municipality in connection
therewith); and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of Provider or Permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the Provider or Permittee of the
Rights of Way, to which Provider’s or Permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the Municipality’s negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage; and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the Provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the Municipality’s actions; and
            3.   Arising out of Provider or Permittee’s failure to comply with

Municipality’s notification, the Municipality shall schedule and hold a
meeting, to make available a forum at which all then current Providers may
address any questions, concerns and make reasonable suggestions regarding the

comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the Rules and Regulations in a manner
that best serves the Municipality, for approval by the legislative authority.

termination, lapse, or revocation of a Certificate of Registration, such

Works or to health, whether by themselves or through interacting with other
wastes in the public sewers.
      (4)   A surcharge will be added to cover the cost of handling and
treatment of the extra-strength wastes.
   (b)   Pretreatment Facilities. When, after making such a review, the Sewer
Engineer concludes that, before the person discharges his wastes into the
public sewers, he must modify the structures, processes or operations of the
Sewage Works or injurious to health, then the person shall either modify his
wastes at the point of origin or shall provide and operate at his own expense
such preliminary treatment or processing facilities as may be determined to be
necessary to render his wastes acceptable for admission to the public sewers.
   (c)   Prior Approval of Pretreatment Facilities. Plans, specifications and
other pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or
processing facilities shall be submitted to the Village for examination and
approval and no construction of such facilities shall begin until the Village
has given its written approval. Such approval shall not exempt the person from
the obligation to make further reasonable adaptations of such facilities when
such adaptations prove necessary to secure the results desired. Plans,
specifications and other pertinent information shall also be submitted to the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (d)   Operation and Pretreatment Facilities. When such preliminary treatment
facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory
and effective operating condition by the person at his own expense and shall be
subject to periodic inspection by the Village. The person shall maintain
suitable operating records and shall submit to the Sewer Engineer such monthly
summary reports of the character of the influent and effluent as the latter may
prescribe.
   (e)   Grease and Sand Traps. Whenever the Village determines interceptors or
traps are needed to protect the sewerage system or the operations of the
Wastewater Treatment Plan from grease, oil, sand or similar substances
occurring in a customer’s sewage, then such traps shall be installed by the
customer on his own lines at his own expense and shall be so maintained by him
that none of such substances can be carried over into the public sewers. All
traps shall subject to the Village’s approval as to construction, location and
installation.
(Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)
 
929.09  CONTROL OF ADMISSIBLE INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (a)   Submission of Data on Industrial Wastes. Any person who discharges
industrial wastes into the Village’s sewerage system either directly or
indirectly, shall, upon the written request of the Village Administrator, fill
out and file with the Village within ninety (90) days an Industrial Waste
Questionnaire to be furnished by the Village, in which he shall set out the
quantity and characteristics of the wastes discharged into the Village’s
sewerage system. Similarly, any person desiring to establish a new connection
to a public sewer for the purpose of discharging industrial wastes shall be
required to fill out and file such a questionnaire, which shall include actual
or predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes to
be discharged. When special circumstances such as the size or complexity of his
sewage disposal problem would make complying with the time schedule cited above
an unreasonable burden on the person, an extension of time, not to exceed
ninety days, may be granted by the Village upon presentation of a proper
application.
   (b)   Control Manholes. Any person discharging industrial wastes into a
public sewer, either directly or indirectly, may be required by the Village,
upon the recommendation of the Sewer Engineer, to construct and maintain at his
own expense one or more control manholes at a specified location or locations
to facilitate the observation, measurement and sampling of his wastes. Such
manholes shall be constructed in accordance with the standards and
specifications of the Village. The Village may also require the person to
install and maintain in any such manhole at said person’s expense an approved
volume-measuring device. Plans for the installation of control manholes and
related equipment must be approved by the Village, upon the recommendation of
the Superintendent or the Sewer Engineer, before construction is begun.
   (c)   Waste Sampling.  
      (1)   In addition to the requirements of the Industrial Cost Recovery
Ordinance, any industrial wastes discharge din to the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection and determination of character and
concentration. The examination shall be made as often as the Sewer Engineer
deems it necessary (but at least one a year) and may include the use suitable
continuously monitoring instruments in appropriate cases. Samples shall be
collected either manually or be approved mechanical devices and in such a
manner as to be representative of the overall composition of the wastes.
Sampling period shall be for a period of time to be determined by the Sewer
Engineer. Every care shall be exercised in collecting the samples to insure
their preservation, until analyzed, in a state comparable to that at the time
the samples were collected.
      (2)   The installation and maintenance of the sampling facilities shall
be the responsibility of the person discharging the wastes and shall be subject
to the approval of the Village. Access to sampling facilities shall be granted
at all times to the Sewer Engineer or his duly authorized representative.
Operation and testing may be required to be done by the Village and paid for by
the industrial user. All testing procedures will be performed to meet all the
requirements or Federal Regulations 40 CFR 136.
   (d)   Waste Analysis. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in “Standard Methods” or other
methods approved by both the Village and E.P.A. However, alternative methods
for certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual
agreement between the Sewer Engineer and the customer. The Village shall make
and charge the industrial user for all analyses of the industrial user’s wastes
as well as other tests the Sewer Engineer may deem advisable. Analyses made by
the Village at the request of the customer shall be charged to the customer
according to the standard work order billing practices. All such analyses shall
be binding in determining strength-of-wastes surcharges and other matters
dependent upon the character and concentration of wastes.
   (e)   Use of Representative Analyses. Until an adequate analysis of a
representative sample of customer’s wastes has been obtained, the Village
shall, for the purpose of this ordinance, make a determination of the character
and concentration of the customer’s wastes by using data based on analyses of
similar processes or data for his type of business that are available from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or from industry-recognized authoritative
sources. This method, if selected by the Village, shall continue at the
Village’s pleasure or until an adequate analysis has been made.
   (f)   All data collected pertaining to industrial wastes includes records
kept by each industrial user shall be subject to audit and review by the
Environmental Protection Agency and Village.
(Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)
929.10  DAMAGE.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance,
or equipment which is part of the Village sewer works. Any person violating
this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly
conduct and upon conviction shall pay a maximum fine of $100.00 plus payment
for all damages. (Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)
929.11 ACCESS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Sewer Engineer and other duly authorized employees of the Village
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,
and testing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The Sewer
Engineer or his representatives shall have no authority to inquire into any
processes including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper, or
other industries beyond that point have a direct bearing on the kind and source
of discharge to the sewers or waterways or facilities for waste treatment.
   (b)   While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to
in subsection (a) above, the Sewer Engineer or duly authorized employees of the
Village shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established
by the company and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to
the Village employees and the Village shall indemnify the company against loss
or damage to its property by Village employees and against liability claims and
demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the company and
growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be caused
by negligence or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
   (c)   The Sewer Engineer and other duly authorized employees of the Village
bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all
private properties through which the Village holds a duly negotiated easement
for the purpose of, but not limited to inspection, observation, measurements,
sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage works lying
within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement,
shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement
pertaining to the private property involved. (Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)
929.12  USER CHARGES.
   (a)   A proportionate rate for the operation, maintenance, and replacement
of the sewage disposal system be charged to all users based upon the following
formula:
      OM&R =    A/V
   
      Where A =   Total annual operation, maintenance and replacement costs for
the wastewater treatment collection system.
         V =   Total metered volume of water used per year by users of the
system.
   (b)   Debt/Capital Improvement Charge (DCIC). The rate for repayment of
capital costs associated with the construction of the sewage improvements shall
be charged to all users based upon the following formula:
      DCIC =   B/V
 
      Where B =   Total amortized annual debt/capital improvement costs.
 
         V =   Total metered volume of water used per year by users of the
system.
   (c)   Calculation of Charges. The sewer service charge for each user shall
be calculated by multiplying the currently adopted OM&R rate and DCIC rate,
determined as above, by the actual water meter reading in 1,000 gallon
increments.
   (d)   Surcharge. Sewerage or industrial wastes above normal domestic sewage
strength, but acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewerage system shall
be subject to a surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of
either or both of two constituents of water or wastes:
      (1)   Total suspended solids, and/or
      (2)   Five-day BOD at 20 degrees C., and as herein provided.
      Formula for SS:
 
      SS rate =    AC
 
      Where A =   Annual cost of treating suspended solids.
 
      C = Total annual pounds of solids treated.
   (e)   Usage Charge. All users of the sanitary sewerage system shall be
charged a sewer service charge based on usage of the system. No free service
will be granted to any user of the system. Charges shall be determined as
follows:
      BOD rate = B/D
 
      Where B =   Annual cost for treating biochemical oxygen demand.
 
      D =   Total annual pounds of BOD
When either or both the total suspended solids and the BOD of a water or waste
accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of their constituents
for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or both, as the case may
be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
      (1)   Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $.18/lb = Suspended
Solids Surcharge.
      (2)   Pounds of excess BOD per day x .22/lb = BOD Surcharge.
In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the user charge as defined in
Section 1.
The pounds of BOD per days and/or pounds of suspended solids per day, above the
concentration previously described for formal strength systems, shall be
determined by the Village or their authorized representative.
In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the Village shall have
the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any other pollutants into
the sewage system.
   (f)   Annual Review of Charges.  
      (1)   The sewer service charge and user charges shall be reviewed
annually by the Village of New Concord in order to determine whether or not
they are sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization costs, and annual
cost of operation and maintenance of the sewerage system. If the difference
between the total annual revenue derived and the total annual cost is
sufficient to justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service or user
charges, the Village will adjust to maintain a proportional user charge.
      (2)   Each user is to be notified at least annually, in conjunction with
a regular bill, or the rate and that portion of the sewer service charge which
is attributable to OM&R costs of wastewater treatment services.
         (Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)
929.13  PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.
   (a)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner’s or operator’s own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Village for review, and shall be approved
by the Village before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Village so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the Village detailing the date, time, and cause of
the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge;
and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five (5) days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. D-12-94-1. Passed 12-12-94.)

"Subdivision Regulations of the Village of New Concord," and shall hereinafter
be referred to as "these regulations”. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and
publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.
Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that
roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to
urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby
affected in many important respects. It is, therefore, to the interest of the
public, the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived,
designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum
standards.
   (b)   The Comprehensive Plan, Comprehensive Plan Updates, and the following
standards guiding the Planning Commission are designed to provide for the
harmonious development of the area; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate
provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provision for light, air,
recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer and other sanitary
facilities.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   These regulations shall be administered by the Village Administrator with
assistance by the Village Engineer. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.04 JURISDICTION.
   These regulations shall be applicable to all subdivisions of land within the
Village corporation limits or lands that are in the process of annexation to
the Village of New Concord. The Village Planning Commission shall have the
power of final approval of all plats.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.05 RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.
   The provisions of these regulations shall supplement any and all laws of the
State of Ohio, Village ordinances, or any and all rules and regulations
promulgated by authority of such law or ordinance relating to the purpose and
scope of these regulations. Whenever the requirements of these regulations are
at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the most restrictive, or that imposing
the higher standards, shall govern. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.06 AMENDMENTS.
   These regulations may be amended after public hearings and other
requirements as specified in the appropriate sections of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1101.07 SEPARABILITY.
   If, for any reason, any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or other part
of these regulations should be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be invalid, such judgement shall not affect the validity of these regulations
as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so held to be invalid.

1109.01 TYPES OF SUBDIVISIONS AND PREAPPLICATION MEETING.
   There are two types of subdivisions; major subdivisions which require the
submission and approval of a plat, and minor subdivisions which have an
abbreviated approval process. Either residential or commercial uses may qualify
as a major or minor subdivision. Minor subdivisions involve the division of
parcels along existing public roads, and no more than five lots after the
original tract is completely subdivided. Major subdivisions involve more than
five lots, and/or the construction of new public improvements, condominium
developments, or other developments involving easements of access. The
subdivider is encouraged to meet with the Village Engineer or designated
representative prior to submitting any plans or plats. The purpose of this
meeting is to discuss early and informally the purpose and effect of these
regulations and the criteria and standards contained therein; and to
familiarize the developer with the Comprehensive Plan, the zoning ordinance and
the drainage, sewerage and water systems for Village of New Concord.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1109.02 PREAPPLICATION SKETCH CONTENT.
   (a)   The subdivider may submit, to the Planning Commission, a sketch plan
legibly drawn at a suitable scale and containing the following information:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision in relation to existing community

manufacturing establishments, residential development and existing natural and
man-made features, such as soil types, vegetation, contours and utilities in
the neighboring area.
      (2)   The layout and acreage of streets, lots and any non-residential
sites, such as commercial, manufacturing, school or recreational uses within
the proposed subdivision.
      (3)   The location of utilities in the proposed subdivision, if
available, location of significant natural features, or the locations of the
nearest sources for water and public facilities for the disposal of sewage and
storm water.
      (4)   The scale and title of the subdivision, a north arrow and the date.
      (5)   Name, address and telephone number of owners and developers.
   (b)   The purpose of this sketch plan is to provide the developer with the
opportunity to discuss a proposed development at a more conceptual level.
Review of a sketch plan can provide the developer with Village staff and
Planning Commission input before more detailed engineering expenses are
incurred. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1109.03 PRELIMINARY DRAWING.
   (a)   After the preapplication stage, the subdivider may submit a

ODOT District "5". The commission shall not approve the plat for 60 days from
the date the notice is received by the ODOT District "5". If the Highway
Director notifies the Commission that it shall proceed to acquire the land
needed, then the Commission shall refuse to approve the plat. If the ODOT
notifies the Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public
interest, or upon the expiration of the 60 day period or any extension thereof
agreed upon by the ODOT and the property owner, the Commission shall, if the
plat is in conformance with all provisions of these regulations, approve the

1113.01 GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   The regulations in this chapter shall control the manner in which
streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.
These design controls shall help insure convenient and safe streets, creation
of usable lots, provision of space for public utilities and reservation of land
for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
   (b)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing the
design of each future subdivision early in its design development. The
Commission shall insure that all of the requirements of this chapter are met.
In addition, all improvements must meet the minimum requirements of the
Construction and Materials Specifications of the State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.02 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares, or extensions thereof, shall conform with the Comprehensive Plan
and any area specific plans as adopted by Village Council. Thoroughfares not
contained in the aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendation of the
Planning Commission based upon the design standards set forth in this Article.
In addition, no plat shall be approved unless it conforms with the requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Relation to Adjoining Street System. The proposed street system shall
extend existing streets or projects at the same or greater width, but in no
case less than the required minimum width.
   (b)   Street Widths.
      (1)   The minimum width of right-of-way, measured from the lot line to
lot line, shall be as shown on the Comprehensive Plan, or if not shown on such
plan, shall be not less than as indicated in Tables 1 and 2 of this chapter.
      (2)   In cases where topography or other physical conditions make a
street of the required minimum width impracticable, the Planning Commission may
modify these requirements. Through proposed business areas, the street widths
shall be increased ten feet on each side, if needed, to provide parking without
interference of normal passing traffic.
   (c)   Additional Width on Existing Streets. Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional rights-of-way to meet the above
minimum street width requirements.
      (1)   The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the
subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
      (2)   When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing
street, at least one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the
center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the
resulting right-of-way width be less than sixty feet.
   (d)   Restriction of Access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or
highway, the Planning Commission may require such lots to be provided with
frontage on a marginal access street.
   (e)   Intersections.  
      (1)   Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is
possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than specified in
Table 3.
      (2)   Property line radii at street intersections shall not be less than
twenty feet and, where the angle of street intersection is less than 75
degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater curb radius. Wherever
necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius
without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width,
the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back
sufficiently to permit such construction.
   (f)   Street Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 500 feet
shall not be allowed.
   (g)   Private Streets and Reserve Strips.
      (1)   There shall be no private streets platted in any subdivisions.
Every subdivided property shall be served from a publicly dedicated street.
      (2)   There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets,
except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the community
under conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
   (h)   Alleys. Alleys may be provided to the rear of all lots used for
commercial or industrial purposes and shall not be provided in residential
subdivisions, except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the
Planning Commission of the need for alleys.
      (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.03 SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   No land shall be subdivided which is held unsuitable for its intended use by
the Planning Commission for reason of flooding, inadequate drainage, soil and
rock formations with severe limitations for development, severe erosion
potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal
capabilities or any other feature harmful to the health, safety or welfare of
the future residents of the proposed subdivision or community. However, the
Planning Commission may approve the preliminary and final plats if the
subdivider improves the land consistent with the standards of this regulation
and other applicable ordinances to make the area, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, suitable for its intended use.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.04 STREET DESIGN.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extend, width, grade construction and
location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan and any area
specific plans as adopted by Village Council and construction standards of the
municipality, or subsequent amendments thereto, and shall be considered in
their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions and
public convenience and safety; and in their appropriate relation to the
proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The street pattern
shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The
subdivider shall provide, within the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the
necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance or alignment of such
streets in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan and any area specific plans
as adopted by Village Council.
   (b)   The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be no more than one
foot below the 100-year flood elevation. The Planning Commission may require,
where necessary, profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance
with this requirement. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood
flows without unduly increasing flood heights.

access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be 20 feet for the right-of-way and
18 feet for the pavement width.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.11 STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local
streets. The intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or
collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible
interference with traffic movement on the streets. The Planning Commission may
require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.12 STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with arterial streets so that no

   (a)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth in this chapter, and shall be arranged to
accommodate lots and building sites of the size and character required for the
district as set forth in these Subdivision Regulations or the Zoning Ordinance
and to provide for the required community facilities.
   (b)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance of
interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
   (c)   No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet or shorter than 400 feet and
the block width shall accommodate two tiers of lots, except where unusual
topography or other exceptional physical circumstances exist.
   (d)   Where blocks are over 800 feet in length a cross-walk easement not

Subdivision Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district
in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
   (c)   Each lot shall front on a public thoroughfare. The minimum lot sizes,
widths and setbacks shall be as specified in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and radial
to curved street lines, except where the Commission determines that a variation
to this rule would provide a better layout.
   (e)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except where the Commission
determines that it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
   (f)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line in each
direction of less than that which is consistent with the Zoning Ordinance.
   (g)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three times its
average width, nor shall it have an average depth of less than 120 feet.
      (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.16 SITE GRADING.
   (a)   All lots shall be graded to carry surface water to an approved water
course or storm sewer. Preliminary lot grading shall be completed at the time

five foot high masonry wall or a five foot high chain link fence may be
required by the Commission. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
1113.19 DEDICATION OF PARK LANDS OR FOR PAYMENTS OF FEES IN LIEU THEREOF.
   As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision or of a final plat
of a planned development, the Village of New Concord shall require land for
park and recreational purposes, or cash contributions in lieu of land, or a
combination of both, at the option of the Village, be provided to serve said
needs specifically and uniquely attributable to the residents of the
subdivision or planned development. This land or cash or combination thereof
shall be provided in accordance with the following criteria and formula:
   (a)   Criteria for Park and Recreational Land Requirements.
      (1)   Land Requirement and Population Ratio. The amount of land required
for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct function of
the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The total
requirement shall be 7.0 acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate population.
Ultimate population shall be computed on the basis of four persons per unit,
unless it can be shown that a lesser number of persons can reasonably be
expected as a result of the type of development proposed.
         Open Space Critieria for Consideration: Open space; recreational
facilities. Common open space and recreational facilities: requirements and
disposition:
         A.    No less than twenty (20) percent of the land in any approved
Planned District Development Plan shall be designated common open space or
permanently natural scenic preserves, arranged and restricted by easement,
covenant, deed, or dedication to assure that such open spaces shall be
permanently preserved and maintained. Such open spaces shall not include
publicly dedicated streets, land in the right-of-ways of private streets, off-
street parking areas, or loading areas;
         B.    Planned residence developments of 200 dwelling units or more
shall provide, as a part of the parkland dedication requirement of subsection
at least one five (5) acre relatively flat grassed common area for neighborhood
field recreation, preferably integrated with a neighborhood pedestrian/jogging/
bicycle path system, or system of common areas, tot lots, or other similar
areas at least five (5) acres total in area.
      (2)   Location. The location and configuration of the site to be
dedicated shall be determined by the Planning Commission based upon
recommendations contained in the Comprehensive Plan and in consultation with
any applicable municipal park and recreation committees. The Planning
Commission shall also consider the suitability of the site for park purposes or
development, its relationship to population concentrations, and its proximity
to other park or recreational lands.
      (3)   Minimum Size. The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park
and recreational purposes shall be no less than 10,000 square feet, one
dimension of which cannot be less than 100 feet, except that the Planning
Commission may recommend that the Village Council accept the dedication of a
smaller size, when required by the specific plans of the development, and when
the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is
demonstrated.
      (4)   Use of Detention Areas for Required Dedications. Detention areas
for storm water control shall not qualify as land for park and recreational
purposes, unless the use of the property for such purposes is clearly
demonstrated.
      (5)   Open Spaces and Recreational Areas. Land required for park and
recreational purposes shall be owned and maintained by the Village or
Homeowners Association. The Village shall approve the detailed plans for all
improvements for such park and recreational land which is privately owned and
maintained, and guarantees of the permanency of the use and maintenance of such
privately owned and maintained park and recreational open space, satisfactory
to and enforceable by the Village shall be entered into by the subdivider or
developer, which guarantees may include covenants and/or express provisions in
the articles of condominium ownership, or constitution and by laws of a
homeowners' association.
   (b)   Criteria for Requiring a Contribution in Lieu of Park Sites. Where the
development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be
practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and
recreational purposes as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider
or developer shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required.
      (1)   Cash Contribution in Lieu of Park and Recreational Land
Dedications. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land
dedications shall be held in trust by the Village, or other public body
designated by the Village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreational
land, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the
residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any
existing local park and recreational land that already services such needs.
      (2)   Refund of Cash Contribution. If any portion of a cash contribution
in lieu of park and recreational land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu
of school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein 7
years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the subdivider or
developer who made such contribution, along with any accrued interest earned on
such funds.
      (3)   Fair Market Value.  The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be
based on the fair market value of the acres of undeveloped land in the area to
be improved as specified herein, that otherwise would have been dedicated as
park and recreational sites. Evidence of the value of the land shall be
provided by a third party and deemed acceptable by the Village Planning
Commission.
      (4)   Criteria for Requiring Dedication and a Fee. A combination of land
dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required, when:
         A.   The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or
adequate land to meet the dedication requirements hereunder. That portion of
the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or sufficient
for the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and
a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land
that would have been required to be dedicated.
         B.   A major part of the local park or recreational site or school
site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from
the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required
by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required.
      (5)   Criteria for a Fully Developed Park.  A fully developed park,
including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping, and recreational
equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is
limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision
can be satisfied with a smaller but fully developed park with a more intensive
activity level.
   (c)   Combining with Adjoining Developments. Park or recreational land
dedications and school site dedications may be combined with dedications from
adjoining subdivisions and developments in order to produce usable recreational
areas or school sites without hardship on a particular developer.
   (d)   Topography and Grading. The slope, topography, and geology of the
dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites for park and recreational uses shall not differ
greatly from surrounding land. (Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)
 
1113.20 PUBLIC USE AND SERVICE AREAS.
   (a)   Easements for Utilities.
      (1)   Except where alleys are permitted, the Planning Commission shall
require easements, ten feet in width, for poles, wires, conduits, storm and
sanitary sewers, gas, and water mains or other utility lines, along all front
and rear lot lines and along side lot lines if necessary if in the opinion of
the Planning Commission. Easements of the same or greater width may be required
along the lines of, or across, lots where necessary for the extension of
existing or planned utilities.
      (2)   Public utility companies may be consulted for their opinion on
easement locations and widths so as to minimize future difficulties in
servicing. The Village Engineer shall present the plan to utility companies on
behalf of the developer and Municipality.
   (b)   Community Assets.  In all subdivisions due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical spots and
similar community assets, which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
value to the property.
   (c)   Suitability of the Land.
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land
if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it
has been determined that, in the best interest of the public, the site is not
suitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed.
      (2)   Land designated as FEMA flood zone A or AE, property known to
flood, and land deemed to be topographically unsuitable shall not be platted
for residential occupancy, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to
health, life or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard. Such land within
the plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not be endangered by
periodic or occasional inundation or shall not produce unsatisfactory living
conditions.
   (d)   Large Tracts or Parcels.  When land is subdivided into larger parcels
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for
the opening of future streets and logical further re-subdivision.
   (e)   Variances. Where the subdivider can show that a provision of these
standards would cause unnecessary hardship if strictly adhered to and where,
because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to the site, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, a departure may be made without destroying
the intent of such provisions, the Commission may authorize a variance. Any
variance thus authorized is to be stated in writing in the minutes of the
Planning Commission with the reasoning on which the departure was justified set
forth.
   (f)   Zoning or Other Regulations. 
      (1)   No final plat of land within the force and effect of an existing
zoning ordinance will be approved unless it conforms with such ordinance.
      (2)   Whenever there is a discrepancy between minimum standards or
dimensions noted herein and those contained in zoning regulations, Building
Code or other official regulations, the highest standard shall apply.

1117.01 GUARANTEE FOR INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS AND SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENT
AGREEMENTS.
   (a)   Completion of Improvements. Before the final subdivision plat is
signed by the Chairman of the Planning Commission, all developers shall be
required to complete, in accordance with the Planning Commission's decisions,
and to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer, all the street, sanitary and
other public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots of
the subdivision, as required in these regulations, specified in the final
subdivision plat and as approved by the Planning Commission, and to dedicate
those public improvements to the Village of New Concord, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances on the dedicated property and public improvements. At
the time that plans are approved, the developer shall be required to submit a
construction time schedule, an estimate of construction costs and a material
specification list itemizing the material type, supplier and manufacturer.
   (b)   Subdivision Improvement Agreements and Guarantee.
       (1)    Agreement. The Planning Commission at its sole discretion may
waive the requirement that the applicant complete and dedicate all public
improvements prior to approval of the final subdivision plat and, as an
alternative, permit the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement
agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public
improvements no later than two (2) years following the date on which the
Chairman of the Planning Commission signs the final subdivision plat. The
applicant shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement until
acceptance by the Village Council of the dedication of that completed public
improvement and also shall warrant that all required public improvements will
be free from defect for a period of two (2) years following the acceptance by
the Village Council of the dedication of the last completed public improvement.
The subdivision improvement agreement shall contain such other terms and
conditions agreed to by the applicant and the Planning Commission.
      (2)    Covenants to Run. The subdivision improvement agreement shall
provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land
and bind all successors, heirs and assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision
improvement agreement will be approved by the Planning Commission and Village
Council, and shall be recorded in the Muskingum County Recorders Office.
   (c)    Security. Whenever the Planning Commission permits an applicant to
enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, it shall require the applicant
to provide a bond or cash escrow as security for the promises contained in the
subdivision improvement agreement. Security shall be in an amount equal to one
hundred and fifteen (115) percent of the estimated cost of completion of the
required public improvements, including lot improvements. The issuer of the
letter of credit or the escrow agent, as applicable, shall be acceptable to the
Planning Commission.
      (1)    Cash Escrow. If the applicant posts a cash escrow as security for
its promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the escrow
instructions shall provide: (1) that the subdivider will have no right to a
return of any of the funds except as provided herein and (2) that the escrow
agent shall have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the Village of New
Concord whenever the Village Law Solicitor presents an affidavit to the agent
attesting to the municipality's right to receive funds whether or not the
subdivider protests that right. If and when the Village of New Concord accepts
the offer of dedication for the last completed required public improvement, the
Village shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but ten percent
(10%) of the funds represented by the letter of credit or cash escrow if the
subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. The
residual funds shall be security for the subdivider's covenant to maintain the
required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements are free
from defect.
      (2)    Bond. The subdivider may post a bond as security for promises
contained in the subdivision improvement agreement subject to the approval of
the Village Attorney, and Village Council.
      (3)   Temporary Improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Planning Commission and shall
maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the Planning
Commission.
      (4)    Costs of Improvements. All required improvements shall be made by
the developer, at his or her expense, without reimbursement by the local
government or any improvement district except that, as may be allowed under
state law, the developer may form or cause to be formed a special district or
districts to construct and finance the construction of required public
improvements excluding lot improvements on individual lots.
      (5)    Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no
subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been
posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period specified by
the Planning Commission in the resolution approving the plat, the sketch plat
or preliminary plat approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases
where a subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and security has
been posted and required public improvements have not been installed within the
terms of the agreement, the Village of New Concord may then: (1) declare the
agreement to be in default and require that all the improvements be installed
regardless of the extent of the building development at the time the agreement
is declared to be in default; (2) suspend final subdivision plat approval until
the improvements are completed and record a document to that effect for the
purpose of public notice; (3) obtain funds under the security and complete
improvements itself or through a third party; (4) assign its right to receive
funds under the security to any third party, including a subsequent owner of
the subdivision for which improvements were not constructed, in whole or in
part, in exchange for that subsequent owners promise to complete improvements
in the subdivision; (5) exercise any other rights available under the law.
      (6)    Acceptance of Dedication Offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be by ordinance
of the Village Council. The approval of a subdivision plat by the Planning
Commission, whether sketch, preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to
constitute or imply the acceptance by the Village of any street, easement or
park shown on plat. The Planning Commission may require the plat to be endorsed
with appropriate notes to this effect.
   (d)   Inspection of Improvements.
      (1)    General Procedure and Fees. The Village Engineer shall provide for
inspection of required improvements during construction and ensure their
satisfactory completion. The developer shall pay to the Village of New Concord
an inspection fee based on the estimated cost of inspection, and where the
improvements are completed prior to final plat approval, the subdivision plat
shall not be signed by the Chairman of the Planning Commission unless the
inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be
due and payable upon demand of the Village and no building permits or
certificates of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the
Village Engineer finds upon inspection that any one or more of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the Village's
construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be responsible
for properly completing the improvements. The developer shall notify the
Village Engineer 48 hours minimum in advance of the date on which construction
is to commence so inspection may be appropriately schedule.
      (2)   Release or Reduction of Security.
         A.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The New Concord Village
Council will not accept dedication of required improvements, nor release nor
reduce the amount of any security posted by the subdivider until the Village
Engineer has submitted a statement indicating that all required improvements
have been satisfactorily completed and until (1) the developer has certified to
the Village Engineer, through submission of a detailed "as built" drawings of
the subdivision, indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other
information required by the Planning Commission or Village Engineer, that the
layout of the line and grade of all public improvements is in accordance with
construction plans for the subdivision and (2) evidence, satisfactory to the
Village Law Director, is furnished indicating that the improvements have been
completed, are ready for dedication to the Village and are free and clear of
any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such approval and recommendation by
the Planning Commission, Village Engineer and Law Director, the Village Council
shall thereafter accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with the
established procedure, and State Law. For one (1) year after Village Council
acceptance of the improvements, the Developer must provide a maintenance bond
for 10% of the construction estimate for the purpose of guaranteeing the work
completed.
         B.   Reduction of Escrow Funds and Security. If the security posted by
the subdivider was a cash escrow, the amount of that escrow shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only
to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was
accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the subdivision.
Funds held in the escrow account shall not be released to the subdivider, in
whole or in part, except upon express written instructions of the Village Law
Director. At the end of the warranty periods, all escrow funds, shall be
released to the subdivider.
   (e)    Maintenance of Improvements. The developer shall be required to
maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks until acceptance of the
improvements by the governing body.
(Ord. 2019-4. Passed 10-14-19.)

1153.14 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District (PUD) is to achieve, to
the greatest possible degree, land development that is responsive to the
natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site. The PUD
should be a well-integrated development in terms of major design elements such
as roads, drainage systems, utilities, and open space. The PUD also allows
greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected and
development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner.
   (a)   General Requirements. A PUD may be located in any area of the Village
of New Concord where the applicant can prove that a proposed development would
meet the purpose of this Section. The tract of land proposed to be developed as
a PUD must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity, and
must be at least 5 contiguous acres in size.
   (b)   Permitted and Conditional Uses. An applicant may propose to include
any mixture of land uses which are listed as permitted or conditionally
permitted in any zoning district, except industrial, with the following
limitations: The proposed location of commercial uses shall not have an adverse
impact upon adjacent property or the public health, safety, and morals. Not
more than 35 percent of the gross acres in a proposed development may be
devoted to commercial uses. Further, not more than 25 percent of the gross
acres in a proposed development may be devoted to dwellings that are not
detached single-family dwellings.
   (c)   Development Standards. The following standards represent broad
parameters under which all PUD developments must be designed:
      (1)   Central Water & Sewer Facilities: All structures in developments
approved as a PUD must be served by central water & sewer facilities.
      (2)   Clustering Residential Development & Density: Clustering
residential density is permitted and encouraged to provide required common open
space. Overall, the area devoted to residential land uses shall have a maximum
total density of four dwelling units per acre of land (net acres, excluding
roads). This total density may, however, be clustered in particular areas of
the development to a level of up to 10 dwelling units per net acre in any given
area, provided, however, that no less than forty (40) percent of the site is
devoted to useful and desirable common open space established to provide
recreational opportunities and to preserve unique environmental features on the
site.
      (3)   Maximum Impervious Surface: For all areas proposed for residential
uses in the development the amount of impervious surface proposed must not
exceed 50 percent of the total developed residential area. For all areas
proposed for commercial uses in the development, the amount of impervious
surface proposed must not exceed 75 percent of the total commercial area.
      (4)   Development Layout and Design: Specific residential density, as
well as, the development intensity of non-residential uses and the development
design and layout shall be based on the applicant's ability to provide
sufficient evidence to the Planning Commission and the Village Council that the
overall development displays excellence in design by properly considering:
significant natural and historic features, topography, natural drainage
patterns, roadway access and circulation, surrounding land uses, the
enhancement of the general welfare of the public, and aesthetically desirable
land development. Attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land use and activities.
      (5)   Front, Side & Rear Setback Standards for Perimeter Lots: All lots
that are located along the perimeter of the PUD shall have minimum front, side
and rear setbacks equal to those that would normally be specified in the
applicable conventional zoning district for the particular land use.
      (6)   Common Space: A minimum of forty (40) percent of the gross acres
developed in the PUD shall be reserved for common open space for the residents
of the area. This required amount of common space shall be established as open
space forever and provisions shall be established for maintenance and care. The
legal articles relating to any organization of property owners in the
development charged with such open space maintenance is subject to review and
approval by the Village of New Concord. The Village Planning Commission and/or
Village Council may require as a condition of final approval, any evidence
deemed necessary to document that the required common space will remain in its
stated condition forever (including such as legal documents as deed
restrictions, conservation easements, etc.).
      (7)   Front, Side, and Rear Setback Standards for Interior Lots: Within
the PUD, the standards for setbacks shall be fully described in the proposed
preliminary and final development plan submitted according to the requirements
of this Section.
      (8)   Off Street Parking and Loading Facilities: For all land uses
located within the PUD, the Parking and Loading standards contained in Article
VI shall be applied.
   (d)   General PUD Approval Procedure. The applicant for a PUD must submit
both a preliminary plan and a final development plan. Property must also be
rezoned to PUD and the decision to approve a final development plan and to
rezone a property PUD are done concurrently. The final development plan, with
all conditions, stipulations, requirements become the zoning requirements for
that particular property. All development restrictions described in the final
development plan and supporting documents become the official zoning
requirements of the subject property.
   (e)   Preliminary Development Plan Submission. The applicant shall submit 10
copies of a proposed preliminary plan to the Zoning Inspector along with the
required application fee. The proposed preliminary development plan shall
include the following:

   (f)   Additional Information and Fees. The Village Planning Commission may
at its sole discretion, require additional information such as maps, data, or
reports including environmental impact studies and an archaeological survey of
the property prepared by an appropriate professional. The applicant shall be
responsible for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Village in reviewing
the preliminary and final development plans or any modifications thereof. Such
expenses are beyond the application fees established by Village Council and may
include professional service fees such as legal fees and the fees for the
services of other professionals such as geologists, landscape architects,
planners, engineers, environmental scientists, or architects, incurred in
connection with reviewing the plans and prepared reports.
   (g)   Preliminary Plan Review. Within 30 days following the submission of
the required information, a public hearing shall be scheduled on the proposed
plan. Notice of this hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least 15 days before such hearing. Notice of this hearing shall
also be sent to all property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
development.
   (h)   Preliminary Development Plan Review as a Subdivision.
      (1)   Concurrently, with the PUD review procedure described herein, all
PUD developments must also be reviewed as a subdivision pursuant to the Village
Subdivision Regulations. Where possible, reviews and hearings will be held
concurrently to facilitate timely action on proposed developments. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter conflict with requirements contained in the
subdivision regulations, the provisions herein shall apply. Criteria for
Approval of A Preliminary Development Plan.
      (2)   Within twenty (20) days following the public hearing, the Village
Planning Commission shall act to approve, disapprove or conditionally approve
the preliminary plan according to the following criteria:
         •   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the comprehensive plan.
         •   That the benefits, improved arrangement, and the design of the
proposed development justify the deviation from standard development
requirements included in the New Concord Zoning Ordinance.
         •   That the uses requested in the proposal are compatible with
surrounding land uses.
         •   That there are adequate public services (e.g., utilities, fire
protection, emergency service, etc.) available to serve the proposed
development.
         •   That the proposed development will not create overcrowding and/or
traffic hazards on existing roads and/or intersections.
         •   That the arrangement of land uses on the site properly consider
topography, significant natural features, natural drainage patterns, views, and
roadway access.
         •   That the clustering of development sites are shown to preserve any
natural or historic features and provide usable common open space.
         •   That the proposed road circulation system is integrated and
coordinated to include a hierarchical interconnection of interior roads as well
as adequate outer-connection of interior collector streets with off-site road
systems.
         •   That there are adequate buffers between incompatible land uses.
         •   That the Village Planning Commission is satisfied that the
developer possesses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required one year and complete the project within three years or
within the phasing schedule.
   (i)   Effect of Approval of the Preliminary Development Plan. The Planning
Commission approval of a preliminary plan will be considered an approval of the
preliminary development plan in principle only. Approval of the preliminary
plan does, therefore, not approve any development on the site nor shall it be
construed to absolutely endorse a precise location of uses, shape of parcels,
or engineering feasibility. Approval of the Preliminary Development Plan is
necessary, however, before the applicant may submit a Final Development Plan to
the Planning Commission and Village Council for approval and rezoning to PUD.
   (j)   Final Plan. The applicant shall submit ten (10) copies of the proposed
Final Plan to the Village Zoning Inspector along with the required application
fee. The final plan shall include all of the written information required for
the preliminary plan application (See Section subsection (e) hereof) revised as
necessary and:
      •   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted and
accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development.
      •   A copy of proposed deed restrictions.
      •   Besides the information provided on the preliminary plan, the final
plan shall be drawn to a maximum scale of (1" to 100') and include:
      •   A survey of the proposed development site, showing dimensions and
bearings of the property lines; area in acres; topography; and existing
features of the development site, including major wooded areas, streets,
easements, utility lines, and land uses;
      •   The location and dimensions of all lots, setbacks, and building
envelopes.
      •   Engineering drawings and plans of sewer and water facilities as well
as, street and drainage systems.
       •   Landscaping plan for all buffers and other common areas.
      •   Architectural guidelines to apply throughout the development.
      •   The proposed names of all interior streets proposed for the
development.
      •   Layout and dimensions of all parking and loading areas along with an
indication of what they are to be built to serve.
   (k)   Final plan and Rezoning Approval Procedure Process. The decision to
rezone land to PUD and to approve the Final Plan are technically separate
decisions. However, to provide for the efficient and timely processing of both
the rezoning request and the request for final plan approval, all PUD final
plan submissions are deemed to be an application for amendment to the Zoning
Code according to Chapter
1181 All procedures (Planning Commission review, public hearing, and final
action by Council), therein shall be followed in considering an application for
a rezoning of the land in question to PUD. Upon approval of such application to
rezone the property in question to PUD, the Zoning District Map of the Village
of New Concord shall be amended to designate the project area as "PUD."
Thereafter, with the concurrent approval of the rezoning and final plan, all
development restrictions and conditions described in the Final Plan shall
become official requirements of the PUD.
   (l)   Criteria of Approval - Final Plan. The New Concord Planning Commission
and the Village Council of New Concord shall review the proposed Final Plan
according to the following criteria:
      •   That the proposed development is in conformity with the Goals and
Objectives of the comprehensive plan.
      •   That the proposed development advances the general health, safety and
morals of New Concord.
      •   That the New Concord Planning Commission and Village Council are
satisfied that the developer possesses the requisite financial resources to
begin the project within the required one year and complete the project within
three years or within the phasing schedule.
      •   That the interior road system, proposed parking, and any off-site
improvements are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated
by and within the proposed development.
      •   That any exception from standard district requirements can be
warranted by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development
plan, according to these PUD requirements.
      •   That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned
in coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
      •   That the existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service, and drainage plan will be adequate for the population densities and
non-residential uses proposed in the PUD.

      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1157.07 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW CRITERIA.
    In the review of applications for a certificate of appropriateness and
other matters, the Board shall be guided by the following requirements and
criteria:
   •   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period building,
structure or site and their environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when feasible.
   •   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent or inappropriate to the original
integrity of the building shall be discouraged.
   •   If changes to a building that have taken place in the course of the time
are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site
and its environment, and these changes are deemed to have acquired
significance, then this significance (if any) shall be recognized and
respected.
   •   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that
characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity.
   •   Significant architectural features that have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
and if possible, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence
rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   •   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials should
be avoided.
   •   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or next to any project.
   •   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties
shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy
significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is
compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property,
neighborhood or environment.
   •   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the original structure would
be unimpaired.
   •   The Design Review Board may require applicants to explore alternatives
to the demolition.
   •   The design of new structures and of additions to existing structures,
including new site improvements, shall take into account the architectural
style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of other
structures and premises within the Architectural Review District.
   •   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures shall use natural traditional exterior materials such as brick,
stone, masonry and wood, where possible.
   •   Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that are both
identified with the origin or the era in which the area was originally built,
should be used for building exteriors for all new construction.
    •   All signs shall be of such a style or design that is reflected in the
district, and shall conform to the requirements of Chapter
1173. Sign size and shape shall also respond to the existing proportions of
period structures, and signs shall not be permitted to cover or otherwise hide
important architectural features.
      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1157.08 PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be filed with
the zoning inspector, and the Design Review Board shall meet within 10 business
days following the submission of a complete application. In addition to an
application form, the Design Review Board shall specify the type of drawings,
materials, sketches and material samples required which must accompany an
application form.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall review, and approve, disapprove, or
modify applications, and upon such approval, or approval with modifications
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness. Such a decision must be made
within seven (7) calendar days following the meeting, unless an extension is
agreed to by the applicant.
(Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1157.09 APPEALS.
   An applicant who has been denied a certificate of appropriateness by the
Design Review Board may appeal the decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Any
such appeal shall be made within ten (10) days after the complaint of action or
inaction of the Board. Upon hearing such an appeal, the Board of Zoning
Appeals, may reverse, affirm or modify the order or determination, and issue a
certificate of appropriateness. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall base their
decisions on the appeal criteria listed in this Zoning Code.

1157.10 STATE ROUTE 83 CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   The purpose of the SR 83 Corridor District Overlay is to help ensure
that development and redevelopment of this corridor takes place in a manner
that results in an efficient, safe, and attractive environment. The SR 83
Corridor is the primary gateway to New Concord, and its character, quality,
appearance and urban design is highly significant. This area introduces
visitors to the community and creates first impressions of civic desirability
and quality. It is also very important that this corridor develop and redevelop
with a high level of transportation functionality to help prevent accidents and
congestion as vehicular movement increases.
   (b)   The importance of the SR 83 Corridor justifies additional
architectural requirements and development standards contained in this Overlay
Zoning District. These standards are articulated in a separate document titled
"State Route 83 South Friendship Drive, Design Framework Manual." This document
is dated February 9, 2015 and has been adopted by both the New Concord Planning
Commission and the New Concord Village Council. It provides, specific design
principles to be followed. (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)

1169.01 SITE PLAN REVIEW - PURPOSE.
   The purpose of site plan review procedures and requirements is to provide a
means and process wherein proposed development of structures and establishment
of land uses of a certain size and magnitude can be reviewed and considered in
light of the need to:
   (a)   Balance a landowner’s right to use his/her land, with the
corresponding rights of abutting and neighboring landowners to live without
land use conflicts that might arise from "light spillover," noise and visual
impacts.
   (b)   Consider the convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian
movement within the site, and in relation to adjacent areas or roads;
   (c)   Review how utility infrastructure will be addressed
   (d)   Address issues related to the protection of natural features on a
site.
   (e)   Evaluate how proposed land development contributes to community
aesthetics and creates a sense of place that is contextual with community
character.
      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.02 PROJECTS REQUIRING SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   Site Plans are required whenever any one of the following conditions exist:
   (a)   Proposed construction of any new principal use of property, except for
new single or two family dwellings or any residential or non-residential
accessory building.
   (b)   Any proposed construction, alteration, relocation or change in land
use that results in the need for 5 or more off-street parking spaces pursuant
to Chapter
1165.
   (c)   Whenever specifically required by an Overlay Zoning District.
      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.03 SITE PLAN SUBMISSIONS.
   An applicant proposing a development subject to Site Plan Review under this
section shall submit ten (10) copies each of the Site Plan and related
documents, along with the required application fee. When other approvals are
required, such as conditional uses or variances, any additional required
information shall be submitted with the site plan, and related approval issues
shall be addressed by the appropriate board subsequent to site plan review by
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.04 SITE PLAN PROCEDURES.
   After determining that an application for site plan approval is complete,
the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the application to the Planning
Commission and other municipal officials as necessary. If all information
required is not provided, the Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the
applicant of the items needed. Following the determination that the application
is complete, and after proper notifications are provided, the Planning
Commission shall consider the proposed Site Plan and take action. Action on the
site plan shall consist of either:
   (a)   Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the proposed
plan is in compliance with the standards set forth herein; or
   (b)   Approval of the site plan, subject to any conditions, modifications,
and restrictions that will ensure that the project meets the standards set
forth herein.
   (c)   The Planning Commission may table a Site Plan approval decision
pending the provision of specific information, additional plan details,
redesign of all or part of the site layout or other information necessary to
make an informed decision.
      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.05 SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   A site plan shall be prepared at a scale of 1 inch equals twenty feet (20
ft.). Developments greater than five acres may be drawn at a scale of 1 inch
equals fifty feet (50 ft.) on standard 24" x 36" sheets. A site plan shall
include all data, details, and supporting information as required to
demonstrate compliance with code requirements. Review fees may be required to
defray the expenses associated with the public review of the plans, including
the need to retain a registered professional engineer, planner, landscape
architect or other professional consultant to advise the Planning Commission on
any or all aspects of the site plan.
(Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.06 PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   After the Zoning Inspector has found the Site Plan to be complete with
respect to the requirements herein, the Planning Commission shall consider such
a plan at a public meeting, and act to approve the site plan as submitted, or
approve the site plan with modifications. The Planning Commission must act to
either approve the Site Plan as submitted, or it must approve it with specific
modifications and changes. When modifications or changes are required as a
condition of approval, a revised site plan with such modifications shall be
submitted and filed. The Planning Commission and the applicant may mutually
agree to table a Site Plan approval decision if there are outstanding issues
and unresolved concerns.
   (b)   In conducting its review, the Planning Commission shall consider the
Standards for Review contained in this chapter. The Planning Commission, may if
circumstances warrant, limit the number of driveways into or out of a
development to maintain better traffic flow on the public street, reposition
driveways, require additional buffering, or yard requirements to maintain a
better separation of pedestrian and traffic movement, and may require greater
building setbacks to achieve more desirable and safer pedestrian and traffic
movement. The Planning Commission may also consider other modifications to the
submitted site plan that brings the proposed development into better alignment
with the Site Plan Review Criterial and Standards (Section
1165.12).
   (c)   In cases where Site Plan approval involves site improvements that
cannot be fully completed before the building is ready for use, the Planning
Commission may, as circumstances warrant, require a bond or letter of credit to
guarantee completion of specific improvements. Such improvements may include
landscape elements, vehicular or pedestrian features, or other site-related
infrastructure. Alternatively, the occupancy permit(s) for a new building and/
or land use may be withheld until all improvements shown on a site plan are
made.
(Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.07 ADVERTISEMENT OF PENDING SITE PLAN ACTION.
   Prior to formal consideration of a Site Plan, the Village of New Concord may
require that a sign be placed on the subject property that provides a
notification to the general public of the pending action on the proposed Site
Plan.
(Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)

1169.13 SITE PLAN REVIEW CRITERIA AND STANDARDS.
   The following design criteria and standards apply to all construction
subject to Site Plan Review pursuant to this chapter. In addition, this Zoning
Ordinance includes an Overlay Zoning District(s) which includes specific and
unique design standards described or referenced therein. All construction
subject to Site Plan Review shall meet and any special requirements or
standards described in an applicable Overlay Zone, and/or the following general
requirements:
   (a)   The Site Plan shall show that a proper relationship will exist between
thoroughfares, service roads, driveways, sidewalks, bike lanes and parking
areas to encourage pedestrian, bicyclist and vehicular traffic safety on both
public and private lands.
   (b)   All development features, including the principal buildings, open
spaces, service roads, driveways and parking areas, shall be so located to
minimize the possibility of adverse effects upon adjacent development.
   (c)   Building location and placement shall be selected with appropriate
consideration given to minimizing the removal of large trees (in accordance
with change of topography).
   (d)   Visual and auditory privacy for surrounding properties and occupants
should be achieved with a suitable relationship among buildings, fences and
walls, landscaping, topography, and open space.
   (e)   Parking area landscaping and screening shall channel traffic flow in a
safe manner, and on-site traffic circulation shall be designed to provide
adequate access for fire and police protection, and minimize interference with
the traffic carrying capacity of adjacent streets.
   (f)   Refuse storage and pick-up facilities shall be indicated on the Site
Plan and shall be fenced, screened, or landscaped to prevent blowing or
scattering of refuse, and to provide an adequate visual barrier from locations
both on- and off-site.
   (g)   All utilities on-site shall be located underground.
   (h)   Grading and surface drainage provisions shall be designed to minimize
adverse effects on abutting properties, streams, and public streets, and to
minimize the possibility of erosion in a manner consistent with the
requirements of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3).
   (i)   All private streets, driveways, and parking areas are to be of a
useable shape and designed so that lighting from fixed sources and vehicles
does not adversely impact surrounding property.
   (j)   The design of the site and physical structures advances applicable
community planning principles expressed in the Comprehensive Plan and any
related or area-specific planning documents.
   (k)   All principal and accessory buildings shall be designed with quality
architectural elements with contextual scale, color and materials that will
allow a project to blend into its setting and build upon the existing aesthetic
identity of an area. Large building mass and long wall planes should be broken
up with features such as windows, doors, colors, material variations/patterns
and articulation to help provide a sense of human scale.
   (l)   Main entrances of buildings should connect to a walkway to the street
sidewalk. Connecting walkways may cross parking aisles or driveways if
distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance
surface materials such as pavers, bricks, scored concrete or scored and painted
asphalt to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort.
   (m)   Where possible, parking areas shall be distributed around large
buildings on not less than two sides in order to shorten the distance to other
buildings and public sidewalks and to reduce the perceived scale of paved
surfaces.
      (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.14 OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE AND EXPERTISE.
   The Village of New Concord may request that applications for Site Plan
approval be reviewed by professional planners, engineers or landscape
architects to ensure compliance with all code provisions. The costs of securing
expert advice or studies shall be borne by the applicant. (Ord. K-5-94-2.
Passed 5-9-94.)
1169.15 CHANGES TO SITE PLANS.
   After the approval of a Site Plan, the developer, individual property owners
or property owners wish to make major or minor modifications to site plans.
Changes are considered to be either major or minor changes depending on the
level of development and redevelopment activity.
   (a)   Minor Site Plan Changes.  
      (1)   The Zoning Inspector shall review the proposed modifications and
shall determine if the scope of the proposed changes is major or minor in
nature. To qualify as a minor modification, the Zoning Inspector shall find
that proposed modification consists of only activity that is no more intensive
than adjusting the size and location of decks, dumpster locations, patios and
required screening, fencing, lighting, landscaping and other similar minor
adjustments to the site. Minor modifications are also changes that do not
increase in the number of housing units in a structure, or increase building
size(s) by more than 25% and do not modify approved circulation drives and
parking areas.
      (2)   Minor modifications can be reviewed and approved by the Zoning
Inspector. An application for an "Amendment to an Approved Site plan" shall
first be filed with the Zoning Inspector and shall include five copies of
revised development plans clearly showing the proposed changes. The Zoning
Inspector may approve an amended site plan if he or she finds that such changes
are not contrary to any issues raised during the initial review of the site
plan, or are contrary to any other requirement of this Zoning Ordinance. The
Zoning Inspector may also approve an amended Site Plan with minor modifications
subject to conditions. The Planning Commission shall be advised of all minor
changes authorized under the above procedures.
   (b)   Major Site Plan Changes. Major Changes to Site Plans (those that do
not meet the requirements above) shall be resubmitted as a new Site Plan.

of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance only if all of the following findings
are made:
   (a)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions that do not apply generally to other
properties in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
   (b)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions the property
cannot be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to
enable reasonable use of the property.
   (c)   That such unique conditions have not been created by the appellant.
   (d)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
   (e)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification possible of
the regulation in issue. (Ord. K-5-94-2. Passed 5-9-94.)

1197.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible and
economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level of
storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to property
and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of New Concord:
   (a)    This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of New Concord to:
      (1)    Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)    Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)    Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)    Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)    Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)    Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)    Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)    Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)    Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of New
Concord's future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
      (10)    Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)    This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1197.01.
   (d)    Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Muskingum County, and
the Village of New Concord shall comply with this regulation for roadway
projects initiated after the date upon which this Chapter becomes effective
and, to the maximum extent practicable, for projects initiated before that
time.
   (e)    This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)    This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1199 Erosion and Sediment Control.

            (Ord. 2019-5. Passed 12-9-19.)
1197.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)    General: The storm water system, including storm water management
practices for storage, treatment and control, and conveyance facilities, shall
be designed to prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm
event; to maintain predevelopment runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to
meet the following criteria:
      (1)    Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The storm water management practices shall function as an integrated system
that controls flooding and minimizes the degradation of the physical,
biological, and chemical integrity of the water resources receiving storm water
discharges from the site. Acceptable practices shall:
         A.    Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended
to support a watercourse restoration project.
         B.    Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         C.    Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.    Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing storm water peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
Storm water management practices that meet the criteria in this regulation, and
additional criteria required by the Village Engineer shall comply with this
regulation.
      (2)    Practices designed for final use: Storm water management practices
shall be designed to achieve the storm water management objectives of this
regulation, to be compatible with the proposed post-construction use of the
site, to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, and to function safely
with minimal maintenance.
      (3)    Storm water management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1113 Subdivision Design Standards, shall provide storm water management for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from the lot.
      (4)    Storm water facilities in water resources: Storm water management
practices and related activities shall not be constructed in water resources
unless the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits
from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state,
and local agencies as required in Section
1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)    Storm water ponds and surface conveyance channels: All storm water
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing storm water ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)    Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
1197.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that the
site is part of a larger common plan of development where the storm water
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing storm water
management practice, or if the storm water management requirements for the site
are provided by practices defined in a regional or local storm water management
plan approved by the Village Engineer.
      (7)    Maintenance: All storm water management practices shall be
maintained in accordance with Inspection and Maintenance Agreements approved by
the Village Engineer as detailed in Section
 1197.08.
      (8)    Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of New
Concord, storm water management practices serving multiple lots in subdivisions
shall be on a separate lot held and maintained by an entity of common ownership
or, if compensated by the property owners, by the Village of New Concord. Storm
water management practices serving single lots shall be placed on these lots,
protected within an easement, and maintained by the property owner.
      (9)    Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage. Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation; and maintaining unconcentrated storm water runoff to and
through these areas.
   (b)    Storm Water Conveyance Design Criteria: All storm water management
practices shall be designed to convey storm water to allow for the maximum
removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)    Stream relocation or enclosure: The Village Engineer may allow the
enclosure or relocation of water resources only if the applicant shows proof of
compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps,
and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
1197.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1199, Erosion and Sediment Control, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how the project will minimize
changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat
of upstream and downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)    Off-site storm water discharges: Off-site storm water runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the storm water conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around storm water quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the storm water quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)    Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit regrading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed one and one-half (1.5) acres. Flow shall be directed into an open
channel, storm sewer, or other storm water management practice from areas too
long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined by the Village
Engineer.
      (4)    Open channels: Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer
drainage tributary to storm water management practices shall be provided by an
open channel with landscaped banks and designed to carry the ten (10) year,
twenty-four (24) hour storm water runoff from upstream contributory areas.
      (5)    Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey storm water where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under Village of New Concord zoning or where the use of an open
drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
Village Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary:
         A.    Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the five (5) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm, and that
the hydraulic grade line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of
the overlying roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the
roadway during a ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm. The system shall
be designed to meet these requirements when conveying the flows from the
contributory area within the proposed development and existing flows from
offsite areas that are upstream from the development.
         B.    The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is twelve (12) inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private
systems, subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         C.    All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.    The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.    Full headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or
outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)    Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of New Concord:
         A.    Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum twenty-five (25) year, twenty-four
(24) hour storm.
         B.    Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         C.    If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-
five percent (25%) of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one (1) foot of
box culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed.
         D.    The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         E.    The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a ten
(10) fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions.
Erosion protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly
control entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.    All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.    Full headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or
outlets to and from open channels or lakes.
         H.    Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
year storm event.
         I.    Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile
through a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the
100 year, twenty-four (24) hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as
determined by FEMA, whichever is more restrictive.
      (7)    Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey storm water runoff from the 100 year, twenty-four (24) hour storm event
to an adequate receiving water resource or storm water management practice such
that the runoff is contained within the drainage easement for the flood routing
path and does not cause flooding of buildings or related structures. The peak
100-year water surface elevation along flood routing paths shall be at least
one foot below the finished grade elevation at the structure. When designing
the flood routing paths, the conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers
shall be taken into consideration.
      (8)    Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of New
Concord must be compensated by removing an equivalent volume of material. For
all areas of development that do not increase the floodplain storage by one-
tenth (1/10th) of the floodplain elevation there shall be no compensatory flood
storage requirement. First consideration for the location(s) of compensatory
floodplain volumes should be given to areas where the stream channel will have
immediate access to the new floodplain within the limits of the development
site. Consideration will also be given to enlarging existing or proposed
retention basins to compensate for floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic
analysis of the contributing watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the
Village of New Concord, reductions in volume due to floodplain fills must be
mitigated within the legal boundaries of the development. Embankment slopes
used in compensatory storage areas must reasonably conform to the natural
slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The use of vertical retaining structures
is specifically prohibited.
      (9)    Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide
nonerosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)    Storm Water Quality Control:
      (1)    All stormwater quality control shall be in accordance with the
Ohio EPA General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction
Activity Under the NPDES.
   (d)    Storm Water Management on Redevelopment Projects: Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plans for redevelopment projects shall reduce existing site
impervious areas by at least twenty percent (20%). Where site conditions
prevent the reduction of impervious area, then stormwater management practices
shall be implemented to provide storm water quality control facilities for at
least twenty percent (20%) of the site's impervious area. When a combination of

1199.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)    Non-Structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)    Erosion Control Practices. The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)    Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are
otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be employed.
These
techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)    Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)    Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than fourteen (14) days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment
settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion
dikes or channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment
control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village of New Concord
Engineer, is required for any one of the following conditions, as determined in
Table 3 below:
         A.    Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.    Ten (10)-acres of disturbed drainage.
         The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone
and a dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least
sixty-seven (67) cubic yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage
area and have a minimum of forty-eight (48)-hour drain time for sediment basins
serving a drainage area over five (5) acres.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000 feet,
three (3) per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model. When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-
site areas and areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be
included unless runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment
settling pond and is not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of
the dewatering zone must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The
configuration between the inlets and the outlet of the basin must provide at
least two (2) units of length for each one unit of width (>2:1 length: width
ratio), however a length to width ration of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must
be removed from the sediment settling pond when the design capacity has been
reduced by forty
percent (40%). This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half
of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must
consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination
of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to ten (10) acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the
permissible drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 >2% but < 20%
0.125                                >20% but < 50%
      (4)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond.
         Straw or hay bales are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than two inches (2") in diameter, placed over
a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the
most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
Based on site conditions, the Village of New Concord Engineer may require
additional best management practices to control off site tracking and dust.
            These additional BMPs may include:
            1.    Silt fence or construction fence installed around the
perimeter of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
            2.    Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas
must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or
to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
 1199.09(g) of this regulation.
            3.    Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village of New Concord Engineer may
require dust controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas,
tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation
of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to
disturb areas within fifty (50) feet of a water resource or wetland, the
following conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.    All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.    No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.    Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.    Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
      (7)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)    Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)    Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)    Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)    Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this storage
area with a minimum capacity equal to one hundred ten percent (110%) of the
volume of all containers in the storage area.
      (4)    Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)    Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)    Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternately, sediment may
be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter bag or
comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain sediment or
other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge. However,
care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it does not
become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other pollutant
sources.
   (h)    Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven (7) calendar days and within twenty-four (24) hours
after any storm event greater than one half (½") inch of rain per twenty-four
(24)-hour period. The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once
every month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely
due to weather conditions (e.g., site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground
is frozen). A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if prior
written approval has been attained from the Village of New Concord Engineer and
all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)    The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      (2)    Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      (3)    The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
         These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         A.    Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         B.    Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of New Concord or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village of New Concord Engineer. The
inspection form shall include:
            1.    The inspection date.
            2.    Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            3.    Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            4.    Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            5.    Locations of:
               a.    Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               b.    BMPs that need to be maintained.
               c.    BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               d.    Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            6.    Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
         C.    Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         D.    Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         E.    The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years, following
final stabilization, the results of these inspections, the names and
qualifications of personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections,
major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification
as to whether the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on
any incidents of noncompliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)    Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the Village of New Concord Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)    When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)    When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)    When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
      (4)    Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by
the Village of New Concord Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site.
         (Ord. 2019-5. Passed 12-9-19.)

1311.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the Village of New Concord, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of New Concord has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
New Concord as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of New Concord.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  
      (1)   For the purpose of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted.
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Muskingum County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Muskingum County, Ohio and Incorporated
areas both effective July 6, 2010.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authorized by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of New Concord as required by Section
1311.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Development.
      (2)   Any revision to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
are/or studies are on file at the Village Hall at 2 West Main Street New
Concord, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restriction. These regulations are not intended
to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations, zoning or
building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations
shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the land
subject to such interest shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of New Concord, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. C-5-
10-1. Passed 5-10-10.)
1311.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to given them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure  
A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal
A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any
provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.
Base Flood
The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given
year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1% chance annual flood or
one-hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American
Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In
Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the
depth number (from 1 to 3 feet).
Basement
Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all
sides.
Development
Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not
limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor
See “Lowest Floor.”
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
Issued by President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding 
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas from:
   1.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   2.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any
source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
Zone AO: 
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100- year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles,
floodway boundaries (sometimes shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and
the water surface elevations of the base flood.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two
feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   1.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   2.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   3.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   4.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
Village of New Concord’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following
categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest Floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an “enclosed below the lowest floor” which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured
home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Manufactured Home Park
As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.

Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30
and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
Start of Construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value
of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. This
term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless
of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include:
   1.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new construction,”
   2.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to application for a development permit by the
local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions; or
   3.   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic
structure”.
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent with the
variance conditions herein.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1311.03(j)(1).
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or plainmetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of New Concord, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of New Concord have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of New Concord Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of New Concord boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of New Concord suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of New Concord
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA.
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1311.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with increased cost of
compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but not floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant.
         C.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives not feasible;
         D.   Section
1311.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be

maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of New Concord specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section

            (Ord. C-5-10-1. Passed 5-10-10.)
1311.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of New Concord Planning Commission is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Village
Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in the Village
Hall at 2 West Main Street New Concord, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1311.04(d).
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeal Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.  
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
New Concord.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, and standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purpose of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1311.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. C-5-10-1. Passed 5-10-10.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1311.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1311.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1311.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;

a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village of New Concord. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the Village of New Concord from taking such other lawful action
as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village of New Concord
shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the
penalties stated herein. (Ord. C-5-10-1. Passed 5-10-10.)
