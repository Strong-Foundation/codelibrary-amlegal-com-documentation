EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

"Shall (naming the person whose removal is sought) be allowed to continue as
(name the office held by such person)?",with provision being made on the ballot
for voting "yes" or "no" on such question. If a majority of the votes cast

eligible for appointment to fill the vacancy created thereby, however, said
removal shall not bar such person from becoming a candidate for office of the

done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
                                                                                                                             
CHAPTER 103
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
103. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
any future legislation.

if any, and Ohio R. C. 723.01.
   (b)    This chapter shall have uniform application to all persons injured

action or failure to act by an employee which gave rise to a claim of liability
is within the employee's discretion with respect to policy making, planning or

105.05 EXTENT OF MUNICIPAL LIABILITY.
   The City shall be liable to respond in damages to the extent not heretofore
excluded and exempted, if so found by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon
trial thereof, or by way of a legislatively authorized and approved settlement,
on account of injury to a person or persons or damage to property, only as
provided, and to the extent provided, in this section:
   (a)    The City, its agents or employees, shall be liable to respond in
damages, to the extent set forth in subsection (c) hereof, for personal injury
to persons or damage to property, caused by the negligent operation of any
motor vehicle by its employees upon the public roads, highways, or streets of

their employment and authority, except where such injuries are otherwise
exempted from liability under Ohio R. C. 701.02.
   (b)    The City, its agents or employees shall be liable to respond in
damages, to the extent set forth in subsection (c) hereof, for all other claims
or demands for injury to persons or property not otherwise exempted in Section

   (c)    The maximum liability of the Municipality shall, for all causes to
which the City is liable to respond, be limited to the sum of two hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) per injured party, for all injuries and damages,
including any and all court costs, fines or forfeitures and attorney fees;
provided, however, that should the City have liability insurance in effect in a
larger amount, as may legislatively be determined by Council to be available
within the existing budgetary resources of the City, taking into account all
other known and reasonable anticipated fiscal needs for the provision of
governmental services, including but not limited to basic services for police,
fire and public safety for the general health, welfare and convenience of its
citizens, then the City shall be liable to respond to the full extent of its
coverage to any such injured party or parties. In no event shall the
responsibility of the City, its agents or employees to respond in damages
exceed its then existent insurance coverage, or the sum of two hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) per injured party, whichever is greater.
      (Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)
105.06 CLAIMS.
   (a)    No action for damages shall be brought against the City or its
employees or agents unless the claim upon which it is based has been presented
as provided herein:
      (1)   A written claim with respect to an injury to person or damage to
property shall be presented to the City within 180 days after the personal
injury, property damage or death giving rise to the alleged cause of action
occurred, by filing the claim with the Clerk of Council. The claim shall
contain all of the following:
         A.    The name and address of the claimant;
         B.    The address to which the person representing the claim desires
notices to be sent;
         C.    The date, place and other circumstances of the occurrence which
gave rise to the claim asserted;
         D.    A general description of the injury, damage or loss incurred so
far as it may be known at the time of presentation of the claim; and
         E.    The name of the political subdivision, and the name or names, if
known, of its employees, agents or other persons, causing or contributing to
the injury or loss.
   If the written claim required by this section is not filed within the time
provided by this section, the City in an action filed against it may interpose
a plea that the claim has not been filed or has not been timely filed, and the
failure to file the claim within the time provided by this section is a bar to
the action or any claim thereunder.
   (b)    Except as may otherwise be statutorily established, an action against
the City or any employee or agent of the City arising out of an injury to
person or damage to property, or any cause of action arising from such personal
injury or property damage, or any other civil action for money damages, whether
brought as an original action, a cross-claim, a counter-claim, a third-party
claim, or as a claim for subrogation, shall be brought within two years after
the cause of action for the personal injury or property damage, or other
damages arose, or within any applicable shorter period for bringing the action
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)
105.07 DAMAGES; BENEFITS.
   Except as otherwise expressly mandated by the Ohio Revised Code, in an
action against the City, its employees or agents based on liability under these

   (b)    No punitive or exemplary damages shall be awarded; and
   (c)    No damages shall be awarded for pain and suffering resulting from any
injury.
   (d)    If an injured party receives or is entitled to receive benefits for
the injuries allegedly incurred from a policy or policies of insurance or any
other source other than a joint tort-feasor, such benefits shall be disclosed
to the court and the amount thereof which duplicates any benefit contained in
the award shall be deducted from any award against the City, its agents or its
employees recovered by such an injured party. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to limit the rights of a beneficiary under a life insurance policy.
No insurer or other person is entitled to bring an action under subrogation
provision in an insurance or other contract against the City with respect to
such benefits.
      (Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)
 
105.08 PAYMENT OF JUDGMENTS.
   No property, whether real or personal, or moneys, accounts, deposits or
investments of the City are subject to a levy of execution or judicial sale or
attachment to satisfy a judgment for damages rendered against the City
regardless of whether liability is based on these provisions, other provisions
of the Ohio Revised Code or the common law. Uninsured judgments shall be paid
from funds appropriated for that purpose, and if sufficient funds are not
currently appropriated for the payment of judgments, the Finance Director shall
certify the amount of any unpaid judgments to the taxing authority for
inclusion in the next succeeding fiscal year as provided by Ohio R.C. 5705.08,
unless any such unpaid judgment is to be paid from the proceeds of bonds issued
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 133.27 or pursuant to annual installments authorized by
Ohio R.C. 2744.10. (Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)
105.09 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   At the option of the City, uninsured judgments for liability based on these
provisions may be paid in equal annual installments over a period not to exceed
seven years, subject to the payment of interest at the legal rate.
(Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)
105.10 INDEMNIFICATION OF PERSONNEL.
   The City may defend and may indemnify, in whole or in part, its Council
members, board or commission members, agents or employees for the costs of suit
and judgment rendered, whether or not the action is brought under these
provisions. Amounts expended in the defense of or to indemnify its Council
members, board or commission members, agents or employees shall be from funds
appropriated for this purpose. The defense or indemnity allowed herein is
discretionary and no action or appeal of any kind shall be brought by any
person, including the employee or a taxpayer with respect to the City's
decision whether to indemnify, or with respect to the amount and circumstances
of the indemnification. (Ord. 1985-20. Passed 9-3-85.)

CHAPTER 165
Public Records Policy
165.01   Introduction.
165.02   Public records defined.
165.03   Record requests.
165.04   Costs for public records.
165.05   Email.
165.06   Failure to respond to a public records request.
165.01  INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the City of Canfield (the "City") that openness leads to
a better-informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the City to strictly adhere to the Public Records
Act of Ohio. All exemptions to openness are to be construed in their narrowest
sense and any denial of public records in response to a valid request must be
accompanied by an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined in the
Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must also be
in writing.
(Ord. 2025-15. Passed 6-18-25.)
165.02 PUBLIC RECORDS DEFINED.
   The City, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines records as
including the following: Any document, paper, electronic (including, but not
limited to, email) or other format that is created or received by or comes
under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the organization,
functions, policies, decision, procedures, operations or other activities of
the office. All records of the City are public unless they are specifically
exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code. Records will be organized
and maintained so that they are readily available for inspection and copying.
Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Ord. 2025-15. Passed 6-18-25.)
165.03 RECORD REQUESTS.
   (a)    Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification and should assist the requester in revising the
request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps its
records.
   (b)    The requester does not have to put a records request in writing and
does not have to provide his/her identify or the intended use of the requested
public record. It is this office's general policy that this information is not
to be requested.
   (c)    Public records are available for inspection during regular business
hours with the exception of published holidays. Public records must be made
available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be made
available within a reasonable period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable" take
into account the volume of records requested, the proximity of the location
where the records are stored and the necessity for any legal review of the
records requested.
   (d)    Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately, if feasible to do so. Routine request include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be emailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows. If more copies are requested, an
appointment should be made with the requestor on when the copies or computer
files can be picked up. All requests for public records must either be
satisfied or be acknowledged in writing within three (3) business days
following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine", such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgement must include the
following:
      (1)    The estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request;
      (2)    An estimated cost if copies are requested;
      (3)    Any terms within the request that may be exempt from disclosure;
      (4)    Any denial of public records include an explanation, including
legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt,
the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there are
redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority. (Ord. 2025-15. Passed 6-18-25.)
165.04  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Except as provided in subsection (f) below, those seeking public records
will be charged only the actual cost of making copies.
   (a)    The charge for paper copies is five cents (5¢) per page.
   (b)    The charge for downloaded files to a compact disk is one dollar $1.00
per disk.
   (c)    The charge for USB/$5.00.
   (d)    There is no charge for documents emailed.
   (e)    Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
   (f)    Fees for Video Records:
      (1)   The Department will charge all requesters the "actual cost" of
preparing video records for production to offset the considerable time and
expenses incurred in retrieving, downloading, reviewing, redacting, uploading,
and producing such video records.
      (2)   The statutory term "a video record," for the purposes of this
policy, means a video from one source for one start and stop recording
(essential the beginning and end of a distinct incident). For example, three
officers responding to an incident will each have "a video record" of that
incident from each of their respective body cameras. This will result in an
actual cost charge for each video record - in this example, three video
records.
      (3)   The amount charged for each video record will be based on the
actual cost of the hourly rate(s) of the employee(s) or contractor(s) involved
in retrieving, downloading, reviewing, redacting, uploading, and producing the
video record requested, but will not exceed $75 per hour of footage from a
particular video record. Further, the total amount charged for retrieving,
downloading, reviewing, redacting, uploading, and producing a video record will
not exceed $750 for that particular video record.
      (4)   "Actual cost" includes all employee or contractor time and
materials expended in retrieving, downloading, reviewing, redacting, uploading,
and producing the video record, including staff time, storage media, and a
portion of necessary overhead expenses required to comply with the request.
      (5)   As part of the necessary overhead charges authorized by statute,
each request for video records will include a flat $10 per video record fee to
partially cover costs such as redaction software, video storage, upload and
transmission, and other necessary expenses. This fee is included within the
total actual cost and subject to the $750 maximum per video record.
      (6)   For video records of critical incidents--defined as any instance
where an officer from the Department fires a deadly weapon at a person the
Department will redact and produce the video at no cost to the requester within
a reasonable period of time as defined in R.C. 149.43(B)(l).
         (Ord. 2025-15. Passed 6-18-25.)
165.05  EMAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. Email is
to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should follow
the same retention schedules.
   (a)    Records in private email accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their emails that relate to public business and to copy
them to their business email accounts and/or to the officer's records
custodian.
   (b)    The records clerk or custodian is to treat the emails from private
accounts as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way,
retaining them per established schedules and making them available for
inspection and copying in accordance with the public record laws of the State
of Ohio.
      (Ord. 2025-15. Passed 6-18-25.)
165.06 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request. In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, the City's failure to comply with
a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with the law and to
pay the requester attorney fees and damages.

184.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)   Except as provided in division (1)(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1)(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;

computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;

this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable
year beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
The amount of such net operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is
reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a

division (1)(H)(i) of this section.
            (b)   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person

not fully utilized by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section. To
the extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in
one or more taxable years by operation of division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this
section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in
division (1)(H)(iii)(a) of this section shall apply to the amount carried
forward.
      (I)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or

accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.

      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the

the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be

consecutive days in the Municipality. For purposes of this section, the State's
contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination have no
bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
184.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
184.091  of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
184.051  of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
184.03  of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
184.051  of this Chapter.

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
184.052  of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
184.19  of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
184.19  of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
184.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
184.03  of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.

one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
184.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.062  of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
184.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
184.062  of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

184.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if

hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section

184.081 CREDIT FOR TAXES PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality and receives
Municipal Taxable Income for work done or services performed or rendered
outside the Municipality and has paid a municipal income tax on the same income
taxable under this Chapter to such other municipality, shall be allowed a
credit against the tax imposed by this Chapter. The credit allowed under this
provision shall equal the lesser of (1) the amount of tax actually paid to the
other municipality or (2) one-half of one percent of the tax imposed by this
Chapter.
   (B)   If a taxpayer received a refund of all or any portion of taxes
previously claimed as a credit on a municipal income tax return as having been
paid to another municipality, and the taxpayer claimed a credit for said taxes,
the taxpayer is required to file an amended tax return and pay the balance due
to the Municipality.

184.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the

credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are

184.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
184.096  of this Chapter.

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be

   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
184.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
184.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
184.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period to
the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the report, claim,
statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to which the payment
is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which
the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be
deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. “The date of
postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section

amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax

Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.

signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
184.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
   (O)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment. (Ord. 2016-39.

applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
184.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

184.096 REFUNDS,
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
184.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
184.10  of this Chapter.

the ordinances or rules,, as adopted from time to time before January 1, 2016
of this Municipality..
   (C)   The Municipality shall impose on a taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, and any other payer, and will attempt to collect, the interest

184.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
184.03 (3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right

considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.

of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)

   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

184.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
184.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
184.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
184.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
184.99  of this Chapter for a violation of
184.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
184.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-40. Passed 12-16-15.)
184.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   The members of the Local Board of Tax Review shall be entitled to
receive compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the
board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.

184.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
184.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
184.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
184.18  of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
184.096  of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections

termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the

   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections

      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out

184.03  of the City Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.31 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
184.30  to
184.35  of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
184.02  of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    “Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
184.32  of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
184.03  of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
184.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
184.36  of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (47)(b) of Section
184.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (47)(b) of Section
184.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
184.03  of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.32 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
184.05  of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of Section
184.03  of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

disclose such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a
proper judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the
Revised Code. The tax commissioner may furnish the internal revenue service

the City tax administrator with the following information for every taxpayer
that filed tax returns with the commissioner under Sections

shall provide to the City a report stating the name and federal identification
number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to
the City and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.

information it receives in the performance of its administration of the
municipal net profits tax for taxpayers making the election provided in Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances. The tax administrator shall review these
returns and information, as well as the information received pursuant to
divisions (B) and (C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer
for audit by the tax commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form
prescribed by the commissioner and shall include any information that forms the
basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.34 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

on a form and in the manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable
year.
      (2)    If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one
calendar year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to
compute the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
184.31 ,
184.32 , and, if applicable,
184.36  of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.

   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
184.04  of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.35 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.36 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of Section
184.063  of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
184.31  of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
184.31  of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
184.32  of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
184.32  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
184.32  of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.37 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.38 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
184.30  to 184.45 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and
distributed to municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the
Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-2-18.)
184.39 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
184.30 to
184.45 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
184.41  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.40 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
184.41  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
184.41  of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.41 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
184.40  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-03. Passed 2-21-18.)
184.42 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
184.30  to
184.45  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
184.30  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
184.41  of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in Section
184.41  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.

such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street, after
stopping. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the provisions
that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted to enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow signal indication, after stopping. The right to proceed
with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow, and
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes  a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail
term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

of this section irrespective of whether or not the space is metered.

and ramps. All elevated signs posted in accordance with this division and Ohio
R.C. 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five
feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating an accessible parking
location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed
upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice

the designated accessible parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally
entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under subsection (e) of this section, or

owned parking lots, parking garages, or other parking areas and designated in
accordance with that division, unless one of the following applies:

location in violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section
may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and
pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for
towing and storing motor vehicles.

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person
or organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or
revoked.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.

501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.14 CONTEMPT OF COURT.
   (a)    Direct Contempt. A person guilty of any of the following acts may be
punished summarily by the Mayor (or a magistrate or the Mayor's designate in
the absence of the Mayor or the Magistrate):
      (1)    Disorderly, contemptuous or insolent behavior toward the Mayor or
the Magistrate, the Clerks or Bailiffs in the Mayor's court, tending to
interrupt the due course of court proceedings;
      (2)    A breach of the peace, boisterous conduct or a violent disturbance
tending to interrupt the due course of Mayor's court proceedings; or
      (3)    Willful resistance in the presence of the Mayor to the execution
of an order of the court or the procedures of the court.
   (b)    Indirect Contempt. The Mayor, after notice and proper procedural
notice to the defendant, may punish indirect contempts of court in order to
preserve order in judicial proceedings in the City and to effectively enforce
the judgments and orders of the Mayor's court as follows:
      (1)    The disobedience of or resistance to a lawful order entry or
sentence of the court or an officer of the court;
      (2)    The failure to obey a subpoena lawfully served or the refusal to
be sworn as a witness when lawfully required;
      (3)    The failure of an individual to appear as a witness in court or to
appear in his or her own case proceeding in compliance with the terms of his or
her previous recognizance;
      (4)    The failure to properly carry out a sentence of the Court; or
      (5)    Any other common law contempt of court for which common pleas
judges may punish as contempt's in order that the Mayor may properly enforce
judgment, orders and decrees of the Mayor's court.
   (c)    Hearing. The Mayor may summarily punish for direct contempt's of
court by entry upon the Mayor's court journal if the Mayor finds the defendant
guilty of direct contempt in the presence of the court so as to obstruct the
administration of justice in the Mayor's court.
   Any individual charged with indirect contempt of court shall have an
opportunity for a hearing, by himself or herself or with the assistance of
counsel, by an entry made upon the Mayor's court journal. This provision does
not prevent the Mayor from issuing an arrest warrant to bring the accused into
court or from holding the accused in custody, pending such proceedings. In the
trial of the indirect contempt charge, the Mayor shall determine the nature of
the charge, hear any answer or testimony which the accused makes or offers and
shall determine whether the accused is guilty by evidence beyond a reasonable
doubt.
   (d)    Suspended Sentence. The Mayor may elect to suspend a portion of the
sentence imposed on an individual found guilty in the Mayor's Court under such
conditions as the Mayor shall deem appropriate. The Mayor may compel the
reappearance of the individual convicted at a subsequent time in order to
ascertain whether the conditions imposed upon the individual have been
successfully completed. In such event, the Mayor may elect to reimpose the
suspended portion of the sentence if the Mayor determines that the convicted
individual has not complied with the prior order or conditions imposed upon
such individual.
   (e)    Punishment. An individual convicted of direct contempt of court may
be imprisoned for not more than ten days or fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). In the event that the defendant is guilty of contempt of
court which consists of the omission to perform an act which the defendant has
the capability to perform, the defendant may be imprisoned after conviction
until the defendant performs the act. If the defendant has failed to appear
upon the date named, the court may issue an arrest warrant or order the
forfeiture of the appearance bond of the defendant, or both. An individual
found guilty of indirect contempt of court may be fined up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each such contempt and may be imprisoned not more than
ten days for such contempt, or both, in the sole discretion of the Mayor. (Ord.
2019-13. Passed 3-6-19.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                               $5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to charge under Section
529.02(b) and Section

source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for   its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

registration as prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United

intrusion and includes an interconnected alarm system as hereinafter defined.
   (b)   "Interconnected alarm system" means an alarm system which directly or
indirectly, automatically or manually, uses a telephone line or cable line to
transmit an alarm or message upon activation of the alarm system.
   (c)   "Local alarm system" means an alarm system that when activated only
sounds a horn, bell, buzzer or other type of audible or visible alarm that is
designed to be audible or visible beyond the premises being served, but which

   (d)   "Appropriate authority" means the Director of Safety of the City.
   (e)   "Automatic dialing device" means a device which is interconnected to a
telephone line and is programmed to select a predetermined telephone number and

message indicating a need for emergency response.
   (f)   "False alarm" means an alarm signal or message initiated and
transmitted either automatically or manually through an alarm system, to the
City or the Fire Division eliciting response by police or fire personnel when
fire, smoke, robbery, burglary, vandalism or unauthorized intrusion does not in
fact, exist but does not include an alarm signal caused by hurricanes,
tornadoes, thunderstorms or other catastrophic acts of God not reasonably
subject to control by the alarm manufacturer, installer or owner.
   (g)   "Chargeable false alarm" means an alarm message or signal

include an alarm signal caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms or other
catastrophic acts of God not reasonably subject to control by the alarm
manufacturer, installer or owner.
(Ord. 1984-24. Passed 12-4-84.)

of fire, smoke, robbery, burglary, vandalism, unauthorized intrusion or medical
emergency. If the person proves that the alarm was caused by an event not
reasonably foreseeable and which could not have been prevented by the proper
adjustment or presetting of the sensor threshold, the alarm will be designated
nonchargeable false alarm. Violation of this subsection is a minor misdemeanor.
   (b)   After three officially chargeable false alarms in any twelve-month
period, the appropriate authority shall review the alarm system. The Chief of
Police or Fire Chief may recommend the disconnection of any alarm system upon
forwarding a recommendation to the appropriate authority pending his review.

however, utility service providers and cable operators may place temporarily
trucks, cones, pumps, ventilating equipment, trailers, guards, and other
facilities in the rights-of-way in order to enter existing manholes and other
underground structures to perform routine repair and maintenance of their
facilities which repairs and maintenance do not require cutting, breaking,

performing any other work or activity which disturbs or alters the existing
surface, subsurface, structure, composition, or soil compaction of the rights-
of-way. In no event shall the rights-of-way be obstructed for more than twelve

incremental costs incurred by the City in inspecting and reviewing the
application and associated information and drawings, and in approving such
permit.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.09  LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   (a)    Grantee shall construct, place and install its facilities as set
forth in its application and so as to not interfere with travel and proper use
of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places by the public and to not
interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
Grantee's use of the rights-of-way shall be secondary to the use thereof by the
traveling public (including pedestrians and other proper public uses). Damage
to and repair of pedestals, vaults, manholes or other facilities of the grantee
in the rights-of-way caused by street plowing, street cleaning and other
activities carried out by the City to facilitate such travel and public use
shall be the responsibility of the grantee and no claim may be made against the
City in respect thereto.
   (b)    In all sections of the City where the cables, wires, or other like
facilities of public utilities are placed underground, grantee shall place its
cables, wires or other like facilities underground.
   (c)    Grantee shall construct, place and install its facilities so that
cables, wires, poles and other facilities shall conform to the pattern of the
existing public utility cables, wires, poles and other facilities and to
minimize any damage, destruction or disturbance of the rights-of-way (including
trees, shrubbery and improvements located thereon).
   (d)    Grantee shall relocate, either overhead or underground, its cables,
wires, poles or other facilities when the City determines that such relocation
is necessary for public travel upon and use of the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.10 RESTORATION OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   In case of damage, destruction or disturbance of any street, sidewalk,
alley, public way, paved area, tree lawn or other portion of the rights-of-way
(including trees, shrubbery, and improvements thereon) by grantee, grantee
shall, without delay and at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved
by the City Engineer, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, public
way, paved area, or portion of the rights-of-way (including trees, shrubbery,
and improvements thereon) to its former state of usefulness, repair and
condition, paved, seeded, mulched, replanted, or sodded in a manner and with
the same type, quality, and condition of materials that will match those
damaged, destroyed or disturbed and those of the adjacent property so that
disturbed area is in as good a condition as before the work involving such
disturbance was done. In the event grantee, after ten (10) days advance notice,
fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete such replacement and
restoration work, the City shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to
complete such restoration and to require grantee to pay to the City the cost of
such restoration. In the event that the restoration of the disturbed area, or
the area adjacent thereto, deteriorates at a faster rate than that which would
have occurred had grantee not damaged, destroyed or disturbed the area, then in
that event, grantee shall repair, replace, or restore such areas to their
original condition prior to the disturbance. Any such deterioration occurring
within the five (5) year period following the disturbance will be presumed to
result from grantee's actions and disturbance of the area. Any trees in the
disturbed area or the area adjacent thereto that die within said five (5) year
period will be presumed to have died as a result of grantee's actions and
disturbance of the area. (Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.11 RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   If the City shall elect to alter or change the grade of any street,
sidewalk, alley or other public way, or to change the location of or engage in
the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of any public property,
structure or facility, or to engage in any public improvements, and if as a
result thereof it is deemed necessary by the City for grantee to move,
relocate, change, alter or modify any of its facilities or structures in order
to assure the public’s unencumbered continued use of the rights-of-way for
travel and other proper public uses, then in such event and upon reasonable
written notice of not less than sixty (60) days, grantee at its sole cost shall
promptly move, relocate, change, alter or modify its facilities. In the event
grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete
such relocation work within a reasonable time, the City shall have the
authority, but not the obligation, to move, remove, relocate, change, alter,
modify or abate such structures or facilities and to require grantee to pay to
the City the cost of such relocation, alteration, or modification. In the event
of an emergency which threatens the health or safety of the public requires the
relocation, alteration, or removal of the facilities, the City will attempt to
notify promptly the grantee and Grantee shall have the right to move, alter, or
remove the facilities from the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.12 TEMPORARY MOVEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding an appropriate permit
issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving
of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of
wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and grantee shall have
the authority to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not
less than ten (10) business days advance notice to arrange for such temporary
wire changes. (Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.13  TREE TRIMMING.
   Subject to applicable City Ordinances, grantee shall have the authority to
trim trees upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public ways and
places of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with the wires, cables and equipment of the grantee, except that at the
option of the City, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision
and direction at the expense of the grantee.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.14 JOINT PLANNING AND COOPERATION.
   (a)    Grantee shall cooperate with other grantees and the City for the
best, safest, most efficient, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the
rights-of-way, to minimize traffic and other disruptions including street cuts,
and to achieve the most efficient utilization of, construction in and occupancy
of the rights-of-way. Grantee shall not be required to divulge trade secrets or
other competitively sensitive confidential information the release of which
would cause material injury to the grantee. Any confidential information of a
grantee in the possession of the City will be treated as such, to the extent
determined legally appropriate by the City's Law Director.
   (b)    Grantee shall participate in all joint planning conferences called by
the City to discuss construction projects and other matters impacting the
rights-of-way. Such participation may be by telephone if suitable arrangements
are made in advance.
   (c)    Grantee shall cooperate with other grantees in utilization of,
construction in and occupancy of private rights-of-way within the City, but
only to the extent the same is consistent with the grant thereof, is not
additionally burdensome to any property owner or unreasonably burdensome to the
grantee; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to
require expenditure of funds or rearrangement of facilities by a grantee
without fair compensation.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.15 ERECTION AND COMMON USE OF POLES AND DUCTS.
   (a)    Where utility poles, underground conduits or ducts or other wire-
holding structures or facilities already exist and are reasonably available for
use by the grantee, grantee shall use such poles, conduits, ducts, structures
or facilities to install its cable, wires, and equipment. Where such poles,
conduits, ducts, structures, or facilities are not reasonably available, the
grantee shall have the right to construct, install, erect and maintain its own
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities at locations as it may find
necessary for the proper construction, operation or maintenance thereof. Such
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities shall be identified and set
out in the drawings submitted with grantee's application and City approval of
the grantee's application shall constitute its approval of the construction,
installation and erection of those identified poles, conduits, ducts,
structures and facilities. Grantee shall comply with such conditions as the
City may impose in approving the application and granting any final
authorization to so construct, install, locate and erect the poles, conduits,
ducts, structures or facilities.
   (b)    Grantee shall make available to other attaching parties any usable
space on its poles or in its underground structures on the same terms and
conditions as other grantees make space available on their poles or in their
underground structures. Where the City or a public utility serving the City
desires to make use of the conduits, ducts, poles or other wire- holding
structures of the grantee, but agreement therefor cannot be reached, if the
City determines that the use would enhance the public safety or convenience and
would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations, the City may require
the grantee to permit such use on the same terms and conditions as other
grantees make space available in their conduits or ducts or on their poles or
structures.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.16 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall construct,
install, place, locate and maintain its facilities using commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to
cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public.
   (b)   Grantee shall construct, install, place, locate and maintain its
facilities in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations
of the City or other grantees, and in accordance with good engineering
practices and, where applicable, the requirements of the National Electrical
Safety Code, the rules and regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and all applicable ordinances
and regulations of the City affecting electrical and structural installations
which may currently be in effect or changed by future ordinances, and all other
applicable state or federal construction and safety requirements.
   (c)   Grantee's facilities in, over, under, and upon the streets, sidewalks,
alleys, and public ways or places of the City, wherever situated or located,
shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe, suitable, substantial
condition, and in good order and repair.
   (d)   Grantee shall at all times maintain a force of available employees or
agents sufficient to provide safe, adequate, and prompt maintenance and repair
of its facilities. Such employees or agents shall perform all work,
construction, maintenance or removal of structures and facilities within the
rights-of-way, including tree trimming, in accordance with good engineering,
construction and safety practices, including any applicable safety codes.
   (e)   Grantee shall register, or cause to be registered, its facilities with
the Ohio Utility Protection Service or any successor thereto.
   (f)   Grantee shall cooperate with the City in any emergencies involving the
rights-of- way.
   (g)   Grantee shall field identify, using distinct identification, its
facilities constructed, installed, placed or located in rights-of-way. Such
identification shall be consistent with industry standards for such
identification.
   (h)   Grantee shall designate a single point of contact for reporting of
emergencies and conditions affecting the safety of the public. (Ord. 2008-32.
Passed 10-15-08.)
919.17 MAPS.
   Upon request of the City, grantee shall provide and maintain with the City a
true and accurate map or set of maps showing the location of all grantee’s
facilities in the rights-of-way and other public places. (Ord. 2008-32. Passed
10-15-08.)
919.18 INDEMNIFICATION.
   (a)   Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and
employees, against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions,
suits, proceedings, damages, liabilities, penalties and judgements of every
kind arising out of or pertaining to the City’s granting a rights-of-way
construction permit to grantee and/or the construction, maintenance or
operation of grantee’s facilities including, but not limited to, damages for
injury or death, or damages to property, real or personal, and against all
liabilities to others and against all loss, cost and expense, resulting or
arising out of any of the same.
   (b)   Grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by the City in defending
itself with regard to the claims, causes of action, suits, proceedings,
damages, liabilities, penalties and judgments mentioned in subsection (a)
above. These expenses shall include but are not limited to all out-of- pocket
expenses, such as attorney’s fees, and shall also include the reasonable value
of any services rendered by the City’s Law Director or his assistants, or any
employees of the City.
   (c)   For the City to assert its rights to be defended, indemnified and held
harmless, the City must:
      (1)   Notify grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to
such right;
      (2)   Afford grantee the opportunity to participate in any compromise,
settlement, resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding; and
      (3)   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and make available to
grantee all such information under its control reasonably relating thereto.

919.19 NO RECOURSE.
   (a)   Except as expressly provided in this chapter, grantee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost or expense, or damages
arising out of the provisions or requirements of this chapter or the rights-of-
way construction permit, or because of the enforcement thereof by the City, or
for the failure of the City to have the authority to grant all or any part of
the rights-of-way construction permit.
   (b)   Grantee shall acknowledge, upon executing and accepting a rights-of-
way construction permit, that it does so relying upon its own investigation and
understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant such a permit.
   (c)   Grantee shall further acknowledge, upon executing the rights-of-way
construction permit, that it has carefully read the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the form of the rights-of-way construction permit, and grantee
is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meaning of the terms and
conditions contained therein, and agrees that in the event of any ambiguity or
in the event of any other dispute over the meaning thereof, the same shall be
construed strictly against grantee and in favor of the City.
(Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.20 LIABILITY INSURANCE AND BONDS.
   (a)    Grantee shall maintain, throughout the period of construction and for
so long as the facilities constructed, placed, installed or located occupy the
rights-of-way or other public place, liability insurance insuring the City and
the grantee with regard to all damages as follows:
      (1)    One million dollars ($1,000,000) for bodily injury or death to any

of this chapter. Such insurance, if canceled for any reason, shall immediately
be put back in force subject to the terms and requirements specified herein.
   (c)    Any insurance policy obtained by the grantee to comply with this
section must be approved by the City's Law Director, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, and a certificate of insurance and a duplicate copy
of said insurance policy, along with written evidence of payment of required
premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the Clerk of Council during the
term of this chapter. Such insurance may be changed from time to time to
reflect changing liability limits as may be reasonably requested by the City,
but not below the minimum established herein. Grantee shall immediately notify
the City in writing of any litigation that may develop that would affect the
insurance required herein.
   (d)    Upon acceptance of the rights-of-way construction permit, grantee
shall deposit with the City a surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) in a form reasonably acceptable to the City's Law Director;
provided, however, that the City Manager, in its sole discretion, may waive,
reduce the amount of the bond or require an additional amount to be so bonded.
The performance bond shall be available to insure the faithful performance by
grantee of all provisions of the rights-of-way construction permit. The
performance bond shall be maintained at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) during
the entire term of this chapter, regardless of withdrawals which may be made
under this section. The performance bond shall be conditioned upon and insure
the faithful performance of grantee of all terms and conditions of the rights-
of-way construction permit and the payment by grantee of any claim, liens,
costs, expenses and taxes due the City which arise by reason of the
construction, repair or maintenance of grantee’s facilities in the rights-of-
way or other public place. The rights reserved to the City with respect to the
performance bond are in addition to all other rights the City may have under
this chapter or any law. The company providing such bond must be licensed to do
business in the State of Ohio. In the event of a default by grantee in any of
its obligations under the rights-of-way construction permit which default is
not cured within ten (10) days after notice by the City to grantee of such
default (or such longer time as it is necessary to cure, so long as grantee
commences to cure within ten (10) days and diligently pursues cure), the City
may levy on the performance bond upon notifying grantee of the amount of such
charge. Grantee may contest in good faith any dispute with respect to any levy
by the City on the performance bond. The rights reserved to the City with
respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other rights of the
City, at law or in equity. The performance bond provided hereunder shall
contain the following endorsement:
   “It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled
without thirty (30) days advance written notice to the City of Canfield, Ohio.”
   (e)    Upon written request of the grantee, and upon approval of the City
Manager, grantees who maintain a net book value in excess of fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000) may self- insure and self-bond in lieu of maintaining and
providing the policies of insurance and bonds described above. Such grantees
shall provide to the City Manager such certificates or other documents
attesting to such book value, insurance and bonding as the City Manager may
reasonably request. (Ord. 2008-32. Passed 10-15-08.)
919.21 WRITTEN NOTICE.
   All notices or demands required to be given under the rights-of-way
construction permit or this chapter shall be deemed to be given when delivered

abandoned facilities, the City may, at its option and in addition to the
imposition of any penalties or other remedies hereunder, undertake or cause to

facilities. The City shall have no liability for any damage caused by such
action and grantee shall be liable to the City for all reasonable costs

construction permit.
   (b)    City Manager shall give grantee thirty (30) days prior written notice
of an intent to revoke grantee's rights-of-way construction permit. Such notice
shall state the reasons for such action. If grantee cures the violation or
other cause within the thirty (30) day notice period, or if grantee initiates
efforts satisfactory to the City Manager to remedy the stated violation, the
City Manager shall rescind said notice of revocation. If grantee does not cure
the stated violation or other cause or undertake efforts satisfactory to the
City Manager to remedy the stated violation, the City Manager may recommend

the rights-of-way construction permit. Unless otherwise required by law, the
decision of the City Manager shall be final.

919.25 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.
   (a)    Nothing in this chapter or any rights-of-way construction permit
should be construed so as to grant any right or interest in any rights-of-way
or public property or place. No approval by the City and no location of any

demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Canfield may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.

925.06 RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR DIVISIONS OF WATER AND SEWER.
General Information
   (a)   Water Quality and Service. The Water Department strives to provide a
continuous, safe potable water supply. However, volume pressure and purity
cannot be guaranteed. Changes in weather conditions, treatment process and
mechanical equipment operations all are variables affecting supply.
   (b)   Water Mains May Be Shut Off Without Notice. Water may be shut off
without giving notice in case of breaks in mains, services, other water
department equipment or for the purpose of tapping, extending, repairing,
replacing or cleaning mains. No claims will be considered for damage of any
nature whatsoever arising from such action.
   (c)   Tanks For Reserve Supply Should Be Provided. Consumers whose
operations require a constant and steady supply of water should provide against
interruptions in service by installation of tanks, reservoirs or other
auxiliary supplies sufficient to carry them over the period of interruption in
service.
(ORC 4933.22 and Codified Ordinances Section
 925.03)
   (d)   Right to Enter Premises. The Water Department reserves the right,
through its authorized agents, to enter at all reasonable hours, the premises
to which its service extends for the purpose of reading, repairing, installing,
removing or inspecting meters; or for any other purpose which it may deem
necessary in safeguarding the interest of the Water Department and the
consumer. In the event that access to the meter is not granted as requested by
the City, the City will notify the owner of the premises that service will be
determined within thirty (30) days if access is not granted. If access is not
granted within thirty (30) days, the City may discontinue service to such
premises. In the event the service is shut off, service will not be
reestablished until the owner has:
      (1)   Provided access to such meter(s) as requested by the City, and
      (2)   Paid all applicable reconnection fees.
         (Ord. 2011-05. Passed 2-16-11.)
Metered Consumers

consumer’s responsibility to report their meter reading either by returning the
postage-paid card provided by the meter reader or by telephoning their reading
to the Water Department as promptly as possible.
      (2)   Those consumers who do not cooperate in the prompt reporting of
their quarterly reading will be subject to an estimated bill. Estimated bills
will not be adjusted once posted for that billing period. Estimated bills
should reflect previous usage history.

   (f)   All Water Usage Must Be Separately Metered.  
      (1)   Water will be furnished through metered service only, with each
unit of occupancy having a separate shutoff valve. Notwithstanding the above,
no metered service will be required in the case of construction work or upon
special permission of the Service Director. Sewer charges shall be based upon
the quantity of water used as the same is measured by the Municipal water
meter.
      (2)   Any unauthorized unmetered water usage shall be assessed a usage
fee of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for water and two thousand
five hundred dollars ($2,500) for sewer and the water service will be
terminated. Service shall be instated only after payment of five thousand
dollars ($5,000) assessment and installation of the required meter.
         (Ord. 2011-05. Passed 2-16-11.)
   (g)   Water For Construction May Be Furnished on a Flat Rate. Water for
construction purposes where no metered supply is available will be furnished on

thereby, be relieved from the payment of any delinquencies that might occur.
(ORC 743.04 and Codified Ordinances Section
927.04)
   (k)   Bills to be Delivered to Consumer. The Water Department will undertake
to deliver bills for water by depositing same in the U.S. Post Office only as a
matter of convenience to the owner or customer. Any failure to receive bills

(Ord. 2005-25. Passed 7-6-05.)
   (l)   Water May be Shut Off Against Delinquents.
      (1)   Water may be shut off to any premises if the owner or consumer
becomes delinquent in payment of utility bills or any other obligations to the
City of Canfield Utility Department. A five-day written notice of such action
must be given. Water may be shut off to any premises regardless of whether such
indebtedness was incurred at the premises where service is discontinued or at
any other property of such owner or consumer.
      (2)   Utility bills (water, sewer, storm sewer, etc.) unpaid when due
shall be increased ten percent (10%). Sale of water shall be discontinued on
utility accounts unpaid fifteen (15) days after the due date of bills.

(30) days after notice of the delinquency.
      (3)   Water service which has been shut off pursuant to this subsection
(1) will not be re-established to any premises until payment in full has been
made, whether the delinquency was incurred by a predecessor in interest or the
current owner of the premises. (Ord. 2017-03. Passed 2-1-17.)
   (m)   No Allowance or Rebate on Account for Leaks. No deductions shall be
made or rebate allowed to a consumer of water under meter control by or on
account of leakage in any water pipe, tank or other apparatus or device. The
amount of water registered by any meter shall be charged and paid for in full,
irrespective of whether such water, after having been registered was lost by
leakage, accident or otherwise.
   (n)   Owner’s Duty to See That Water Bills Are Paid. The Water Department
will make every possible effort to collect water bills and assessments as
promptly as the nature and volume of its business permits. But, no consumer or
property owner shall be relieved from an obligation for assessment that may be
unpaid through failure of the Water Department to make collections as provided
by its rules.
   (o)   Water Bill Due Dates and Exceptions.
      (1)   Utility bills are due and payable either at the City of Canfield,
104 Lisbon Streets, Canfield, Ohio, or at the banks authorized by the City to
provide such collection service for their customers.
      (2)   The due date for all utility bills shall be the 15th of the month
following the billing. Any utility bill remaining unpaid on the records of the
City on the 20th of the month shall be assessed a ten percent (10%) penalty.
Each consumer is ultimately responsible to verify that the City received their
payment timely. The City will not be responsible for any delays in payments not
made at City Hall.

   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
      (1)   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
potable water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's potable water systems.
   (b)   Application.  These Rules and Regulations shall apply to all premises
served by the public potable water system of the City of Canfield.
   (c)   Policy. The City of Canfield City Manager or his designee shall be
responsible for the protection of the public potable water supply from
contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the water service
connection. If, in the judgment of the City Manager or
his designee, an approved backflow prevention device is necessary at the water
service connection to any consumer's premises for the safety of the water
system, the City Manager or his designee shall give notice to the consumer to
install such approved backflow prevention device at each service connection to
this premises. The consumer shall immediately install such approved device or
devices at his own expense, and failure, refusal or inability on the part of
the consumer to install such device or devices immediately shall constitute
grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such device or
devices have been installed.

entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization. The development area shall be stabilized as detailed
in Table 4.
 
Area requiring stabilization           Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a Within 2 days of the most recent
surface water of the state and not at  disturbance if that area will remain
final grade                            idle for more than 14 days
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil
stockpiles, that will be dormant for   Within 7 days of the most recent
more than 14 days but less than one    disturbance within the area
year, and not within 50 feet of a
stream.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over Prior to November 1
winter
                                       Within 7 days of reaching final grade or
Areas at final grade                   within 2 days of reaching final grade
                                       for areas within 50 feet of a surface
                                       water of the state.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion matting.
         A.    Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such
as boxed inlet protection, shall be installed on storm water catch basins
located on the subject property and, if there is no threat to public safety, on
curb inlets closest to the construction entrance, to minimize sediment-laden
water entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets.
         B.    Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the City of Canfield shall be used to protect
adjacent properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet
(diffused) flow. Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the
permissible drainage area is limited to those indicated in the Construction
General Permit.
         C.    Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within twenty-four (24) hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch
of rain per twenty-four (24)-hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed
below:
            1.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
            2.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
            3.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.
If the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the BMP must be implemented within ten (10) days
from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
         D.    Final Stabilization: Final stabilization is achieved when the
site has reached seventy percent (70%) cover and when the City Engineer and/or
Mahoning County SWCD approves the site condition.

provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)    These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)    Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2021-15. Passed 3-17-21.)

(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1105.06 JURISDICTION.

with the regulations herein contained, and no plat shall be recorded and no lot
or land shall be sold or improved from any such plat until said plat has been

(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1105.07 AUTHORITY AND ADMINISTRATION.
(a)   A Major Thoroughfare Plan having been adopted by the Commission according
to statutory requirements, the Council and the Commission by virtue of the
provisions of Chapter 711, and more specifically Section 711.09, 711.10, and
711.11 of the Revised Code of the State of Ohio, are authorized, subject to the
holding of required public hearings, to adopt rules and regulations covering
plats for subdivisions of land, and to approve, conditionally approve, or
disapprove plats for subdivision of land falling within their jurisdiction.
Administration of the rules and regulations contained herein shall be the
responsibility of the Commission.
(b)   The Planning Commission by virtue of the authority granted by the
Statutes, Chapters 711, 713 and 735 of the Revised Code of Ohio, or such
Statutes hereinafter in effect, may prepare plans for unsubdivided or
improperly subdivided areas to show a pattern of future streets and public open
spaces.
After the required public hearing has been held, such plans or portions thereof
may be adopted by the Commission and recorded, and thereafter no subdivision
may be approved and no street may be improved or accepted, except that it
conforms substantially to such recorded plan; and no permit may be issued for
construction of a building or structure on land shown within the right-of-way
of any proposed future street until such right-of-way has been acquired or
reserved; however, such permit may not be withheld for more than ninety (90)

Owner.

or injustice, such requirements may be varied or modified so that the
subdivider may subdivide his property in a responsible manner; but, at the same
time, the public welfare and interest of Canfield and the surrounding area are
thoroughly protected and the general intent and spirit of these Regulations are
enforced. The Commission may make recommendations of variations which may be
permitted, but the authority for approval of such variations shall rest with
the Council. Variances shall be submitted simultaneously with the preliminary
plat for the subdivision and shall detail the reasons for and facts supporting
the request.
(b)   The requirements of these Regulations shall insure that all plats shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan of Canfield. All land uses as indicated in
the Comprehensive Plan shall be incorporated on the plat and must conform, in
general, to the areas of land usage as delineated and adopted by the Commission
and the Council. The Major Thoroughfare Plan and the Comprehensive Plan shall
be the guide for all future development or redevelopment in the City of
Canfield. All plats shall insure that adequate public spaces, circulation,
recreation, light and air will be provided and the needs of the entire
community when fully developed and occupied will be fully met. (Ord. 2001-13.

topography, public safety and convenience, and proposed uses of land. However,
where any limited access highway or expressway shown on the Major Thoroughfare
Plan traverses the tract to be subdivided without providing access thereto, no
land is required to be dedicated or left undeveloped for such highway unless an
agreement is made between the subdivider and the proper public agency regarding
the time and method of acquisition for highway use and the payment of
compensation therefore. Where the right-of-way of any other proposed major
highway exceeds one hundred (100) feet, the same provision shall apply to the
additional width required.
(b)   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of existing natural
features, distinctive site characteristics, outstanding scenic, cultural or
historic areas and all such features shall be integrated into the plan to
create functional variations in the neighborhood and more attractive building
sites.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1109.02 SITE PREPARATION REQUIREMENTS.
(a)   Grading. The subdivider shall submit a Grading Plan when requesting
Construction Drawing approval. The required Grading Plan shall be drawn at the
same scale, and on the same base as the required final plat, and shall include
specific details related to the rough and finish grading that will be performed
throughout the proposed subdivision development. Each subdivision, or portion
thereof, shall be planned and graded so that the surface water will drain into
a storm sewer system or adjacent natural watercourses. Where necessary, grading
may be extended into individual lot areas in order to provide suitable finish
elevations for housing sites.
      (1)   All productive topsoil, as defined by the Conservation Service and
approved by the Planning Commission, shall be stripped and stockpiled from the
areas to be graded and shall be replaced and finish graded to a depth of not
less than six (6) inches in an effort to conserve all existing topsoil.
      (2)   The Grading Plan shall indicate the location of all existing wooded
areas. The Subdivider shall make every attempt to preserve and save all such
trees that do not conflict with the location of the required improvements and/
or housing sites. All grading shall be performed in such a manner that will
preserve the existing tree cover.
      (3)   During construction of the subdivision, the Subdivider shall make
provisions to conduct storm water flows through temporary or permanent swales
to nearby natural watercourses or storm sewer. Desilting basins shall be
installed to protect all natural watercourses and/or storm sewers.
      (4)   Provisions shall be made within and around the construction areas
to protect the area from erosion, earth slides, and the abnormal settling or
cracking of exposed earth surface.
      (5)   All lot areas within the subdivision shall be graded to provide
adequate surface drainage.
      (6)   Final grading shall conform to the Grading Plan submitted by the
Subdivider.
(b)   Erosion Control. The Subdivider shall submit an Erosion Control Plan,
which shall be reviewed and approved by the Mahoning County Soil and Water
Conservation District, with his request for Construction Drawing approval. The
required Erosion Control Plan shall specify the procedures and techniques and
timetable to be employed by the Subdivider to control erosion during
construction, and immediately following the completion of the subdivision.
Included within the Subdivider’s Erosion Control Plan shall be provisions
assigned to accomplish the following:
      (1)   The Subdivider shall carry out the development of the subdivision
in such a way as to maintain as much natural vegetation as possible; thereby
limiting the areas that are under construction and exposed to erosion to the
smallest area practical over the shortest possible time period.
      (2)   The Subdivider should utilize temporary swales to direct surface
drainage and storm water flows in desilting basins then into natural
watercourses and/or storm sewer systems.
      (3)   The Subdivider shall periodically clean streets within the
subdivision construction area, especially following periods of rainfall.
      (4)   The Subdivider shall utilize approved dust palliatives, to retard
wind erosion and minimize the amount of airborne dust particles during
construction.
      (5)   The Subdivider shall make every attempt to maintain the subdivision
construction area in good and safe condition, keeping the area as free of
debris as possible.
      (6)   Facilities for cleaning vehicles leaving the subdivision
construction area, especially following periods of rainfall, shall be provided
to prevent mud or other similar materials from being carried from the area into
surrounding streets and into existing storm sewers.
      (7)   All graded areas shall be fertilized, seeded and mulched or
otherwise protected by artificial means against erosion and siltation as soon
as is practical.
      (8)   To control sediment pollution from sheet and rill erosion, no
development area shall have an average annual soil loss leaving the development
area which exceeds fifteen (15) tons per acre the first year commencing from
the time of initial earth disturbance and five (5) tons per acre for any other
year.
(c)   Storm Water Management. Storm water management is a practical, feasible
and desirable element in urban development. Storm water run-off can be
adequately controlled in conjunction with the development of almost any site.
The control program should be tailored to fit the requirements of the
individual project by sound selection of alternative control methods, good
technical and aesthetic design, and quality construction and maintenance.
A storm water management plan shall be submitted to the City Engineer for
review and approval for all developments of 1 acre or more. Said plan shall be
submitted as soon as possible after approval of the preliminary plat and in no
case later than the submission of the construction drawings. The plan shall
incorporate the engineering facets of the system including calculations as well
as proposed maintenance and financial arrangements to perpetuate the system.
Developer to provide to the City Engineer an approved OEPA Storm Water Permit
issued by the OEPA.
      (1)   The following minimum criteria shall be used to establish the storm
water management system:
To control pollution of public waters by soil sediment from accelerated stream
channel erosion and to control flood plain erosion caused by accelerated storm
water runoff from development areas, the increased peak rates and volumes of
run-off shall be controlled such that:
         A.   The peak rate of run-off from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the development area does not exceed the peak rate
of run-off from a one year frequency storm (of 24 hours duration) occurring on
the same area under pre-development conditions.
         B.   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the critical storm, up to
the one hundred year storm, have peak run-off rates no 3 greater than the peak
run-off rates from equivalent size storms under 14 pre- development conditions.
         C.   As a minimum, all retention/detention pond designs shall include
a two stage outlet chamber which shall release storm water based on a 10 year
and 25 year storm and shall be designed with sufficient storage capacity for
the 25 year storm.
      (2)   The critical storm for a specific development area is determined as
follows:
         A.   Determine by appropriate hydrologic method the total volume of
run-off from a one year frequency, 24 hour storm occurring on the development
area before and after development.
         B.   From the volumes determined in (a), determine the percentage
increase in volume of run-off due to development, and using this percentage,
select the 24-hour critical storm from this table.
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is:
Equal to or  and       The critical storm for
greater than less than peak rate control will be
--           10        1 year
10           20        2 year
20           50        5 year

(d)   Protection of Air Resources.
      (1)   Burning. The use of burning at the project site for the disposal of
refuse and debris will not be permitted.
      (2)   Dust Control. The Developer will be required to maintain all
excavations, embankment, stockpiles, access roads, plant sites, waste areas,
borrow areas, and all other work areas within or without the project boundaries
free from dust which could cause the standards for air pollution to be
exceeded, and which would cause a hazard or nuisance to others.
         A.   An approved method of stabilization consisting of sprinkling or
other similar methods will be permitted to control dust. The use of petroleum
products is prohibited.
         B.   Sprinkling, to be approved, must be repeated at such intervals as
to keep all parts of the disturbed area at least damp at all times, and the
Developer must have sufficient, competent equipment on the job to accomplish
this if sprinkling is used. Dust control shall be performed as the work
proceeds and whenever a dust nuisance or hazard occurs.
      (3)   The Developer shall not cause or permit any fugitive dust source
from the building demolition without taking or installing reasonably available
control measures to prevent fugitive dust from becoming airborne. Such
reasonably available control measures shall include, but not limited to, one or
more of the following which are appropriate to minimize or eliminate visible
particulate emissions of fugitive dust in accordance with the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC) 3745-17-08(B). If the Contractor violates or fails to
properly control fugitive dust, in accordance with OAC 3745-17- 08(B), the
Contractor will be fined $2,500 per day, in accordance with the Ohio Revised
Code (ORC) 3704.99.
(e)   On-Site Inspection. Prior to commencement of construction, the City
Engineer shall inspect natural watercourses, storm and sanitary sewers and
surrounding streets to determine their existing condition. During construction
and immediately following the completion of the Subdivision, the City Engineer
shall inspect the subdivision construction area in order to determine the
Subdivider’s compliance with the Grading, Erosion Control, and Storm Water
Management Plans. The subdivider shall be notified in writing of any
deficiencies and shall be directed to make whatever corrections or
modifications are necessary within five (5) working days from the date he
receives such written notification. Should the subdivider fail to
satisfactorily correct such deficiencies, the City of Canfield, Ohio shall
withhold the subdivision bond and/or final approval of the Plat until such time
the deficiencies are corrected.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1109.03 STREETS.
(a)   Design and Arrangement.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in the new subdivision shall make
provision for the continuation of the existing streets in adjoining areas (or
their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided) insofar as they
may be deemed necessary for the public welfare.
      (2)   The street arrangement of any subdivision shall be such as to not
cause hardship to adjacent property owners when they plat their land and seek
to provide access to it. Residential streets shall be so designed as to
discourage through traffic, but off-site streets should be avoided except as
they are separated by not less than four hundred (400) feet at their access
points on a collector street.
      (3)   The angle of intersection between local streets and collector
streets should not vary by more than ten (10) degrees from a right (90 degree)
angle. All other streets should intersect each other as near to a right angle
as possible, and no intersection of streets shall be permitted at angles of
less than seventy (70) degrees.
      (4)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for
considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street should be
avoided.
      (5)   Streets planned to serve multi-family, commercial, business or
industrial areas shall connect directly to major collector streets, so as to
not generate large volumes of traffic on local residential streets.
      (6)   The minimum curb radius shall be twenty-five (25) feet measured at
the face of the curb.
(b)   Alignment.
      (1)   Minimum Radii or Centerline Curvature
Major Streets                    3E
Collector Streets                12E
Minor Streets                    200 feet
Streets Shorter than 500 feet  100 feet
 
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
      (2)   Visibility Requirements. Minimal vertical and horizontal sight
distances shall conform to the then current standards delineated in the Ohio
Department of Transportation Location and Design Manual, Volume 1, Roadway,
Design, Latest Edition, or any duty adopted successor thereto.

(c)   Streets.
      (1)   The major thoroughfares shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare
Plan of Canfield. (See Appendix)
      (2)   The minimum right-of-way widths for streets are as follows:
 
Type of Street or Way                  Right-of-Way
Arterial Highway or Major Thoroughfare Variable*
Secondary or Collector Streets         70 ft.
Minor or Local Streets                 60 ft.
 
*As determined by Commission
      (3)   Cul-de-Sacs. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn-around
having a minimum right-of-way radius of sixty (60) feet. The outside of the
pavement within the turn-around right-of-way shall have a minimum radius of
fifty (50) feet. (Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
      (4)   Dead-End Streets. Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently
shall not be permitted. Any temporary dead-end street, if longer than two
hundred (200) feet or fronted by lots, shall have a paved turning area and
right-of-way equal in diameter to that required for a cul-de-sac. There shall
be provisions made for future extensions of the street and utilities. There
shall be a clause for reversionary rights to the land owners abutting the
temporary turn-around for the excess right-of-way.
When a subdivider is filing for final completion and acceptance of a
subdivision, temporary dead-end streets must be converted to a paved cul- de-
sac with the required curbs and sidewalks, and other required improvements,
unless an agreement is entered into between the developer and the City. Said
agreement must provide the City of Canfield with a cash bond from the developer
in an amount determined by the City Engineer. Said amount shall be sufficient
to complete construction of the cul-de-sac and other improvements in accordance
with these Regulations. Said agreement shall be for a period of not more than
two years. At the end of the two years, if the developer has not proceeded with
the development by extending the temporary dead-end street, the City shall use
the cash bond to complete this portion of the subdivision.
(Ord. 2005-32. Passed 11-16-05.)
      (5)   Half-Streets. Dedication of half-streets shall be prohibited. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the
Commission.
      (6)   Alleys. Alleys shall be prohibited.
      (7)   Limitation of Number of Vehicular Access Points to Arterial
Highways or Major Streets. Safety factors and the need for effective
utilization of major thoroughfares requires limiting the number of vehicular
access points to arterial highways and major streets to promote efficient
traffic movements and reduce safety hazards. Where a subdivision adjoins an
arterial highway or major street, vehicular access to subdivided lots shall be
kept to a minimum and shall not exceed the following 4 standards:

Two (2)
Over 1000 ft.
Two (2) for the first 1000 ft. of frontage
plus one (1) point of access for each
additional 1000 ft. of frontage
 
The local street arrangements connecting with these access points may be
accomplished in one of three ways:
         A.   Marginal Access Street - with a planing strip of a minimum of
twenty (20) feet between the major street or highway pavement and the marginal
access street pavement. The marginal access street shall have a minimum
pavement width of twenty (20) feet. Marginal access streets may be required if
the average daily traffic volume on the major street or highway equal or
exceeds:
Roadway
ADT
2 Lane
12,000 vehicles per day
4 Lane
18,000 vehicles per day
 
         B.   Local Street (reverse frontage) - with residences facing away
from the major thoroughfare. In this case, the rear yard (those between the
residences and the major thoroughfare) shall have a minimum depth of seventy
(70) feet which includes a twenty (20) foot non- access reservation strip
abutting the major thoroughfare for screen planting of trees and shrubs. A
masonry or wooden ornamental screen may be substituted.
         C.   Intersecting Local Streets or Cul-de-Sacs Streets - perpendicular
to the major thoroughfare where unusual topographic conditions warrant such
design.
         D.   Minimum centerline offset of adjacent intersection shall not be
less than 150'.
      (8)   Street Grades. No street grade shall be less than one-half (0.5%)
percent and shall not exceed the following, with due allowances for reasonable
vertical curves:

Secondary Thoroughfares       10%
Minor Streets                 12%
Cul-de-Sacs                12%
 
The lengths of maximum grades shall be kept to a minimum. In exceptional cases,
steeper grades may be permitted upon approval of the City Engineer.
      (9)   Typical Section. For cross-section of streets see approved Standard
Drawings (Appendix C).
      (10)   Street Names. Street names shall be selected which will not
duplicate or be confused with the names of existing streets in Mahoning County
irrespective of modifying the terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc.
Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Commission and wherever
possible shall be in accordance with the following system:
General Direction
Over 1000 ft.
Under 1000 ft.
North-South
Street
Place
East-West

and shall be paid for by the developer before final plat approval or as
provided in the Subdivider's Agreement. Street Signs shall be erected in
accordance with the specifications of the City. All such signs shall also be
subject to the approval of the Commission as to uniform design and legibility.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
   (d)   A Traffic Impact Study shall be required when a new development or
expansion of an existing development generates at least 100 trip ends during
the peak hour of the land use or the peak hour of the subject roadway. Traffic
impact studies shall be conducted in accordance with the Traffic Impact Study
Standards adopted by the City from time to time and any amendments thereto.
(See
Appendix G) (Ord. 2018-37. Passed 11-21-18.)
1109.04 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
(a)   Block Design.
      (1)   No block shall be longer than 1200 feet or less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress and egress.
      (2)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a walkway easement not
less than 10 feet in width may be required, if necessary, to provide proper
access through the block.
      (3)   Blocks for multi-family, business and industrial subdivision shall
be designed to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards, internal
service drives, required off-street parking and other such required facilities
for unit development rather than typical lot and street patterns.
(b)   Lots.

provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
      (2)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule
will provide a better street and lot layout. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
      (3)   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the zoning
regulations applying to said parcel.
      (4)   In case of unusual soil conditions which may impair the health and
safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may be located, upon
recommendation of the County Board of Health or upon the recommendation of the
City Engineer, the Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas than
might otherwise be necessary.
      (5)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy- five (75) feet. Either of the two (2) sides of a corner lot fronting
on a street may be designated the front of the lot provided the rear yard shall
always be opposite the frontage so designated.
      (6)   All corner lots shall have a curve with a minimum radius of twenty-
five (25) feet joining the two (2) sidelines of said right-of-way.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1109.05 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines. Building lines shall be established according to the
minimum building setback lines requirements set forth in the Zoning Ordinance.
 
   (b)   Easements. Easements of at least seven and one-half (7 1/2) feet in
width may be provided on each side of all rear lots and along side lot lines,
where necessary, for underground utilities such as electric, telephone service
and gas mains. Easements having greater width dimensions may also be required
along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may
necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights-of-
ways. For lots facing on curvi-linear streets, the rear easement should consist
of straight lines as much as possible with a minimum number of points of
deflection.
(c)   Easements Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide a minimum easement of forty (40) feet in width, or such width as may be
determined by the Commission along each side of the stream for the purpose of
widening, deepening, relocating or protecting the stream for drainage. (Ord.
2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1109.06 PUBLIC SITES, NATURAL FEATURES, HISTORICAL SITES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
AND OPEN SPACES.
   Where the subdivision contains a park, school or other public area which is
shown in the Comprehensive Plan for Canfield and/or a Historical or
Archaeological Site on Record with the Ohio Historic Preservation Office or
this appropriate Regional office, such area shall either be dedicated to the
proper public agency or it shall be reserved for acquisition thereby within one
hundred twenty (120) days by a purchase or other means, and an agreement shall
be entered into between the subdivider and the proper public agency regarding
the time and method of acquisition and the cost thereof. (Ord. 2001-13. Passed
3-21-01.)
1109.07 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOODING OR CONTAINING POOR DRAINAGE CHARACTERISTICS.
   The right is reserved to disapprove any subdivision which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage characteristics,
however, if the subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will make the
area safe for residential occupancy, the subdivision may be approved, subject,
however, to the approval of the Mahoning County Board of Health and the City
Engineer.

(Ord. 2008-17. Passed 7-9-08.)
(i)   Boundary Monuments. Boundary monuments shall be set so that, upon
completion of the survey, each corner of the property and each referenced
control station will be physically monumented. When it is impossible or
impracticable to set a boundary monument on a corner, the surveyor shall set a
reference monument, similar in character to the boundary monument and
preferably along one of the property lines which intersect the corner. When
such a reference monument is used, it shall be clearly identified as a
reference monument on the plat of the property and in any new deed description
which may be written for the property.
Every boundary monument and/or reference monument set by the surveyor shall:
      (1)   Be composed of durable material.
      (2)   Have a minimum length of thirty inches.

registration number and/or name or company name.
      (5)   Be detectable with conventional instruments for finding ferrous or
magnetic objects.
When a case arises, due to physical obstructions such as pavements, large
rocks, large roots, utility cables, etc., so that neither boundary monument or
a reference monument can be conveniently or practicably set in accordance with
the above, then alternative monumentation, which is essentially as durable and
identifiable (e.g., Chiselled "X" in concrete, drill hole, etc) shall be
established for the particular situation.
(j)   Utilities and Other Improvements. Electrical service, gas mains and other
utilities shall be provided underground within each subdivision and shall not
be placed under the pavement surface except at crossings. Whenever such
facilities are reasonable, accessible and available, they may be required to be

Subdivision Bond based on the total estimated costs, as determined by the City
Engineer, of the required public improvements.
In the case, where the Subdivider elects to construct improvements without a
subdivision bond, the final plat approval will be withheld until satisfactory
completion of the improvements, including the approval of the City Engineer,
along with the presentation of letters of certification of payment in full of
all contractors, subcontractors, suppliers of materials, consulting engineers,
surveyors, and all inspection fees and all other similar fees incurred by the
Subdivider.
The Subdivider who chooses to construct the improvements shall file the
Subdivider's Agreement except that the subdivision bond will not be required.
(b)   Subdivider’s Agreement. The Subdivider shall execute a contract with the
City of Canfield, Ohio, whereby they agree to construct or guarantee the
construction of all required improvements in the subdivision, within a
specified period of time, in accordance with these Subdivision Regulations. The
Subdivider’s Agreement shall be prepared by the City of Canfield in accordance
with all of the legal requirements of the City and shall contain the guarantee
of the Subdivider to the posting of a Subdivision Bond, Maintenance Bond, and
Inspection Fees to cover the costs of all required improvements included within
the subdivision development.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1113.02 SUBDIVISION BOND AND MAINTENANCE BOND.
(a)   Subdivision Bond and Performance Bond. The Subdivider shall post a
Subdivision Bond, in the amount of One Hundred (100) Percent of the total
estimated costs of the construction of the required improvements, as specified
in these Subdivision Regulations in order to guarantee their proper
installation. The City Engineer shall review the Subdivider’s construction cost
estimate and determine if the estimated costs adequately reflect the costs of
the required improvements as well as the time period that is likely to be
required to construct all improvements and shall approve and certify in writing
to the Planning Commission the arrangements of the Subdivider prior to the
posting of the Subdivision Bond.
The City of Canfield, Ohio reserves the right to reject any Subdivision Bond
which the City Engineer has determined to be unacceptable. The subdivision Bond
shall not exceed a period of two (2) years unless mutually extended in writing
by the Subdivider and the City of Canfield, Ohio.
The Subdivision Bond shall be made payable to and enforceable by the City of
Canfield, Ohio and shall provide that the Subdivider, his heirs, successors and
assignees, their agent or servants will comply with all applicable terms,
conditions, provisions and requirements of these Subdivisions Regulations.
(b)   Maintenance Bond. Upon the completion of the required improvements, the
Subdivider shall post a Maintenance Bond in the amount of ten (10) percent of
the actual construction costs of the improvements. The dollar amount of the
Maintenance Bond shall be reviewed and approved in writing by the City
Engineer, prior to the actual posting of the Bond in order to assure that it is
an accurate reflection of the improvement costs. The City Engineer shall
approve and certify in writing that said improvements have been constructed and
completed in a satisfactory manner.
No improvements shall be accepted by the Council until the Subdivider has
posted an approved Maintenance Bond which shall extend for a period of two (2)
years from the date of acceptance by the City in the case of all improvements.
(Ord. 2001-13. Passed 3-21-01.)
1113.03 COMPLETIONS AND PARTIAL COMPLETIONS OF SUBDIVISIONS COVERED BY
SUBDIVISION BONDS.
(a)   Completions. Upon satisfactory completion of all the improvements as
required in Article 400 of these regulations and the approval and certification
in writing of the City Engineer that the improvements have been properly
installed, along with the presentation of letter of certification of payment in
full of all Contractors, Subcontractors, suppliers of materials, Consulting
Engineers, Surveyors and all inspection fees or other similar fees incurred by
the Subdivision Bond may be released. Authorization of the release shall be
obtained in writing from the City upon direction of the Council.
(b)   Partial Completions. Upon satisfactory completion of specific individual
improvements which comprise a part of the total improvements to be constructed
within the Subdivision, and the approval and certification in writing of the
City Engineer that said improvements have been properly installed along with
the presentation of related letters of certification of payment in full of the
involved Contractors, Subcontractors, suppliers of materials, Consulting
Engineers, Surveyors and all related inspection fees or other similar fees
incurred by the Subdivider, a reduction in the Subdivision Bond may be
authorized; provided, however, that such reduction shall not reduce the balance
of the bond below the estimated construction costs necessary to complete the
remaining required improvements. Authorization of the release shall be obtained
in writing from the City.
(c)   Progressive Installation. The Subdivider may apply for approval by the
City of Canfield, Ohio and the recording of a completed portion of a
Subdivision. Under such a progressive development procedure, the sale or lease
of lots within the completed portion of the Subdivision may proceed only when
that portion which has been approved by the City of Canfield, Ohio, has been
recorded in the Office of the Mahoning Recorder.
(d)   Failure to Satisfactorily Complete Required Improvements. The Subdivider
shall be in default of the Subdivider’s Agreement with the City of Canfield,
Ohio when any one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   In the event that the Subdivider has failed to satisfactorily
complete the installation of the required improvements as specified in these
Subdivision Regulations, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Subdivider’s Agreement with the City of Canfield, Ohio.
      (2)   The Subdivider has failed to construct and/or install the required
improvements in accordance with the minimum standards specified in these
Subdivision Regulations, and is unwilling to modify, upgrade or reconstruct
said improvements to conform with the requirements within a thirty day time
period from notification.
      (3)   The improvements constructed and installed in the Subdivision have
failed, deteriorated or have not functioned properly during the two (2) year
time period immediately following their acceptance by the City of Canfield,
Ohio due to the manner in which they were constructed and installed or when the
required improvements are not in accordance with “record” drawings submitted to
the City by the Subdivider and the Subdivider has failed to correct the
deficiencies upon the request and instruction of the City of Canfield, Ohio.

ARTICLE 1
1.      For the purpose of promoting the public health, safety and general
welfare, and determining, establishing and defining SOIL GROUPS, and to adopt
such regulations for each group, and in accordance with provisions of Sections
of the Revised Code of Ohio, the entire area of Canfield City is hereby divided
into the following groups, namely:
 
GROUP I   - Relatively Favorable Soils
GROUP II  - Steep Soils
GROUP III - Seasonably Wet Soils
GROUP IV  - Wet, Shrinks - Swell Soils
GROUP V   - Restricted Soils
2.      The groups are comprised of several soil types as identified
hereinafter and which soil types are shown on the map designated as “the
Canfield District Soil Map”, dated October 1968, and made a part of this
regulation. All pertinent notations, soil mapping unit designators and other
information shown upon the said “Map” shall be as much a part of this
regulation as if the matter and things set forth by the said map were fully
described herein.
 
3.      The soil groups and the “Canfield District Soil Map” were prepared with
the assistance and co-operation of the Soil Conversation Service, USDA,
Canfield Office, and has as its basis the Interim Soil Survey Report, Mahoning
County, Ohio published March 1966. Appendix A is a cross reference of the
letter symbols used in this regulation (which symbols will appear on the final
Soil Survey Report, Mahoning County, Ohio), to the numerical symbols used in
the Interim Report.
ARTICLE II
1.      These regulations shall not repeal, impair or modify private covenants
or other public laws, except that it shall apply whenever it imposes stricter
regulations; the soils groups are arranged in numerically inferior soil
conditions and similarly, the more restrictive foundation requirements apply.
 
2.      The granting of a permit due to the designations, grouping,
characteristics and special foundation requirements, shall not constitute a
representation guarantee or warranty of the suitability of lands,
practicability or safety of any structure, use or other plan proposed.

2.      CHARACTERISTICS
Sub group (a) are light or dark colored moderate to somewhat poorly drained
soils in alluvium on flood plains, water table high during most of the year and
SUBJECT TO FLOODING. Sub group (b) are all severely limited for use as home
sites because of questionable consolidation with respect to bearing.
SECTION 2   -   LIMITATIONS
1.      Generally, buildings will not be permitted in sub-group (a) unless
engineering facilities are provided such as dikes or levees which will protect
the building, whose foundation has been designed to counteract the unsuitable
bearing characteristics and the proposed use will not materially obstruct the
movement of flood waters or substantially reduce the flood water storage
capacity of the flood plain or generate sewage or other liquid wastes that are
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be otherwise injurious to human, animal,
or plant life.
 
2.      Application to build on strip mine spoil, subgroup (b), will be
accompanied by the report of a soil engineer outlining the recommended bearing
capacity and type and size of foundation.
ARTICLE VIII
1.      It is recognized that the soil map is of such scale that the specified
delineation between one soil group and another may vary in fact or that at the
delineation, highly contrasting soils may comprise as much as 15 or 20 percent
of the adjacent soil. Similarly, it is recognized that the use of certain
materials and/or methods may make a foundation design, not conforming to the
minimum standards, acceptable.
 
2.      The Zoning Inspector shall have full authority to place additional
requirements, to modify, change or substitute materials or methods of
construction in order to minimize the structural risks so noted in previous
articles.
 
3.      A permit application whose construction plan does not meet the minimum
foundation requirements of this regulation may:
   a)      Incorporate in the construction plans accepted methods of
construction and/or accepted materials whose use will structurally meet the
added requirements, or
 
   b)      Petition the Board of Zoning Appeals the decision of the Zoning
Inspector, or for a variance or a conditional use. Said Board may request the
Soil Conservation Service to conduct an immediate onsite soil inspection for
the purpose of determining the specific soil type and subsequent group, or
insist that a sub-surface soil investigation be conducted by a Registered Soil
Engineer to determine the soil bearing capacity, its stability and drainage
characteristics.

APPENDIX G
TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY STANDARDS
I.   Purpose
   The primary objectives of a Traffic Impact Study (TIS) are the following:
   •   Provide a basis for assessing the transportation impacts of a new
development or expansion of an existing development and the need for any
improvements to the adjacent road system to provide satisfactory levels of
service and address safety issues.
   •   Address relevant transportation issues associated with development
proposals that may be of concern to neighboring residents, businesses, and
property owners.
   •   Determine the appropriate location, spacing, and design of the access
system for the proposed development in compliance with City standards
   •   Evaluate the internal circulation and connectivity of the proposed
development to provide safe and efficient internal traffic flow and access(es)
to and from the adjacent and nearby roadway system
   •   Provide a basis for improvement and funding discussions in conjunction
with zoning, special permit, and subdivision plat approvals
II.   Traffic Impact Study Warrants
A Traffic Impact Study (TIS) shall be submitted when a new development or
expansion of an existing development generates at least 100 trip ends during
the peak hour of the land use or the peak hour of the roadway. These trip ends
are to be calculated using the latest Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) trip
generation methodology and definitions. If the proposed development is to be
implemented in phases, each major phase along with the total development trips
shall be calculated for warrant purposes.
The City of Canfield retains the right to request a TIS or other traffic study
for a non-major development (less than 100 trip ends during the peak hour of
the land use or roadway). Such a request shall be made within 30 days of the
receipt by the City of the developer's application for rezoning, zoning
variance, special permit, or preliminary subdivision plat.
For any development that generates less than 100 peak hour trip ends and
requests a new access point on a collector or arterial roadway (refer to ODOT
TIMS website for functional classifications), a Traffic Access Study will be
required. See Section VII for Traffic Access Study requirements.
The City shall be consulted to determine if a revised or new traffic impact
study is required where development plans change significantly between the time
that one rezoning, zoning variance, special permit, or preliminary subdivision
plat approval is granted and another is sought.
III.   TIS Preparer Qualifications
Engineers with specific training in traffic and transportation engineering
shall prepare traffic impact studies under the supervision of a professional
engineer registered in the State of Ohio. The registered professional engineer
shall have experience in traffic engineering and shall sign and seal the
report.
IV.   Pre-Meeting
Prior to commencing the TIS, the preparer shall schedule a meeting with
appropriate city or county staff. Other participants in this pre-meeting shall
be county or township officials, or ODOT staff, where deemed appropriate by the
City of Canfield personnel. The participants at the pre-meeting shall identify
and agree upon the following issues and needs prior to the preparation of the
traffic impact study:
•   Study Area
•   Opening and Design Year
•   Field data collection requirements
•   Acceptable volume, crash, signal and other traffic data
•   Development phasing, if applicable
•   Peak traffic hours (analysis hours)
•   Trip generation, trip distribution and assignment methods
•   Applicable planning documents
•   Other traffic impact studies prepared for developments in the study area
•   Utilization of Eastgate COG Regional Transportation Model
•   Background traffic and growth factors
•   Acceptable Level-of-Service (LOS) Analyses - i.e., capacity, signal warrant
•   Right turn on red discount factors
•   Safety issues - i.e., sight distance and crash data
•   Committed and planned roadway improvements and schedule
•   TIS submittal date
The preparer shall submit a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which details the
assumptions and methodologies agreed upon in the pre-meeting and request City
staff concurrence with its contents. The MOU should be submitted to the City
within one week after the meeting and approved within one additional week.
V.   Requirements
   A.   Study Area
The minimum geographical area to be analyzed in a TIS shall be defined as an
area which includes all site access drives and the major roadway intersections
nearest to the subject development site. The City of Canfield retain the right
to modify the minimum study area based on local or site-specific issues or
development size. Any changes shall be clearly defined at the pre-meeting and
in the MOU.
   B.   Access Management
Unless otherwise justified, the recommendations made in the TIS shall comply
with the driveway spacing shown in Table 1:
Table 1: Driveway Spacing Standards
 
Posted Speed Minimum Driveway Spacing
25 mph       155'
30 mph       200'
35 mph       250'
40 mph       305'
45 mph       360'
50 mph       425'
   C.   Analysis Years
Traffic impact studies are to address traffic conditions ten years beyond the
anticipated completion year of the proposed development assuming full build-out
and occupancy (Design Year). If the proposed development is to be implemented
in phases, it may be appropriate also to analyze each major phase (i.e. an
initial phase, one intermediate phase, and full project build-out). An Opening
Year analysis may be requested at the discretion of the City.
   D.   Data Collection/Existing Conditions
The TIS shall use traffic count data less than two years old unless otherwise
agreed upon during the pre-meeting. Weekday peak hour counts shall be taken for
two hours in the AM peak period and two hours in the PM peak period. If a
previous study in the area has already identified the peak one-hour intervals
of traffic, then the City may allow for only one hour of count data to be
collected for each peak period. Traffic counts should not:
         •   be conducted on a regular weekday (non-holiday, or day before/
after holiday)
         •   be conducted during adverse weather that would affect volumes and/
or traffic patterns, and
         •   be conducted during a regular school day, if during the school
year
Crash patterns shall be summarized in the traffic impact study. Crash analysis
should be performed using crash data from at least the most recent three full
years. ODOT's TIMS - GCAT tool should be utilized to pull crash data within the
study area.
   E.   No-Build/Build
The TIS shall examine "before and after", or No-Build and Build, conditions in
order to evaluate traffic impacts associated with the proposed development. The
No-Build condition will include committed/planned developments in the area (see
Section H, Non-site Traffic)
The No-Build condition No-Build and Build conditions shall be calculated for
the design year using the latest version of Highway Capacity Software (HCS) or
Synchro. If the proposed development is to be implemented in phases, each major
phase shall be analyzed and the conditions noted in the MOU.
   F.   Analysis Time Period
All analyses shall examine the weekday peak traffic hours of the adjacent
roadway. However, land use classifications which experience their highest trip
generation levels during periods other than weekday street peak hours shall
require analyses of off-peak conditions to determine proper site access and
turn lane storage requirements. Examples of such land uses include but are not
limited to shopping centers, recreational uses, and special events. The peak
traffic hours to be analyzed shall be decided at the pre-meeting and be clearly
stated in the MOU.
   G.   Site Traffic
Trips generated by the proposed site development shall be calculated using the
most current edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip
Generation manual and the methodologies contained therein including those
relating to pass-by, internal and diverted trips.
Distribution and assignment of the site traffic shall be based on the method
agreed upon at the pre-meeting and on engineering judgement and take into
account the following:
         •   type of proposed development and the area from which it will
attract traffic
         •   size of the proposed development
         •   surrounding land uses, employment centers, residential centers and
population during both opening and design years
         •   conditions on the surrounding street system
         •   logical routings
         •   projected roadway capacities
         •   travel times
   H.   Non-site Traffic
All significant developments within the study area that have approved or TIS
studies should be identified and incorporated into the study. The land use type
and magnitude of probable future developments should be identified during the
pre-meeting and enumerated in the MOU.
The method of projecting non-site traffic shall depend upon the area of study.
Use of the traffic volumes from the transportation model, historic growth
rates, or the build-up method shall be agreed upon during the pre-meeting and
documented in the MOU.
The non-site peak hour volumes should be increased by a 1.20 factor to reflect
design hourly volume (DHV) conditions.
   I.   Level-of-Service (LOS) Criteria
The goal of the City of Canfield for the operation of its roadways is LOS D or
better during peak traffic hours. In any area where the current level of
service is D or worse, this baseline level of service must be maintained or
improved after development.
Improvements necessary to accommodate the non-site traffic in the design year
at LOS D shall be determined even though the developer may not be required to
undertake these improvements.
Signalized intersection capacity analyses must be "balanced". A "balanced"
intersection is one where the worst delay on the north/south approach is within
3 seconds of the worst delay on the east/west approach. If individual movements
are operating at much higher delays than the approaches, the timing shall be
rebalanced, or modifications to the signal phasing will be needed.
Capacity analyses shall use a minimum green time of 7 seconds for left turn
phases, 10 seconds for minor-street through movements, and 20 seconds for
major-street through movements. The sum of yellow and all-red times shall be at
least 5 seconds per phase. Cycle lengths and clearance interval timings shall
be at consistent between No-Build and Build conditions.
   J.   Mitigation
Recommendations shall be made in the TIS for site access points, external
roadway improvements such as additional through lanes and turn lanes, and
traffic control devices necessitated as a result of the proposed development.
The developer will be required to mitigate the impacts of traffic generated by
the project. The time period for the recommended improvements shall be
identified, particularly if improvements are associated with various phases of
the development. Identified improvements to the roadway system, unrelated to
the proposed development, shall also be reported.
   K.   Traffic Signal Warrant
Traffic signal warrant analyses shall be conducted at unsignalized
intersections in the study area, as well as all access points to the proposed
development expected to have more than 50 exiting left turns in the peak hour.
A full signal warrant analysis and an estimation of the year the warrant is met
shall be done. Traffic signal warrant analyses should be performed using the
procedure outlined in the ODOT Traffic Engineering Manual. However, it is not
required to use the software PC Warrants.
Any proposed access or intersection which meets signal warrant thresholds but
does not otherwise meet the spacing requirements and standards noted in Table 1
may be required to be redesigned, reconstructed, and/or relocated.
All existing traffic signals located within the Study Area shall have their
signal timing evaluated. Recommendations shall be made in the TIS to mitigate
any changes, such as timing changes, required for the existing traffic signal
that are generated by the project. Please refer to Section J, Mitigation for
further information.
   L.   Turn Lane Criteria
A left turn lane at driveways or unsignalized movements at intersections should
be provided per Graph 1, 2, or 3, which are the left turn lane warrant charts
contained in the ODOT State Highway Access Management Manual. Graphs 1, 2 and 3
are contained in the Appendix.
The size of left turn lanes shall be based the criteria contained in the ODOT
Location and Design Manual.
Right turn lanes should be provided per Graphs 4, 5, 6 or 7, which are the
right turn lane warrant charts contained in the ODOT State Highway Access
Management Manual with the following exceptions:
         •   right turn lanes are not required for right turn volumes less than
10 vehicles during the peak hour for full build out of the development
         •   right turn lanes are not required for less than 200 vehicles in
the peak hour in the approach lane or curb lane for roadways with greater than
1 approach lane for full build out of the development.
            Graphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 are contained in the Appendix.
The size of right turn lanes shall be based the criteria contained in the ODOT
Location and Design Manual.
Left or right turn lanes shall also be provided when deemed necessary for
safety purposes by the City.
VI.   Report Contents
Each TIS shall have, along with the body of the report, the following unless a
letter report is agreed upon at the pre-meeting:

VII.   Traffic Access Study (TAS)
A Traffic Access Study (TAS) is required for developments generating less than
100 peak hour trip ends and requesting new access on a collector or arterial
roadway. The purpose of the TAS is to determine whether turn lanes are needed
at the proposed site access. The TAS shall include the following components:
   •   Proposed Site Development

   The Planning Commission shall consist of five (5) members as set forth in
Section
7.02 of the Charter.
1127.02 DUTIES.
   The Planning Commission and its staff shall perform the following duties, in
accordance with Section
7.03 of the Charter of the Municipality of Canfield and the Ohio Revised Code:
   (a)   Prepare the Zoning Ordinance, and continuously review such Ordinance
for the purpose of recommending official Map and/or text changes or amendments

conditions;
      (3)    There is a need for additional land in the zoning district
classification being requested for a change, and the minimum size requirements
for zoning districts, specified in Section
1139.01 have been met; or
      (4)    There is an error in the Zoning Ordinance.
   
1127.03 BOARD OF APPEALS.
   The Planning Commission shall function as the Board of Appeals and shall
perform the following functions:
   (a)    Administrative Appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is an error in any interpretation, judgment, determination
or decision made by the Zoning Inspector in the administration and/or
enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance. No public hearing shall be
held.
      (Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)
   (b)    Adjustments. To authorize upon appeal, where because of physical
circumstances, exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, topographic
condition, extraordinary lot conditions, or other conditions peculiar to the
property, building or structure in question, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance and adjustment is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property, provided such minimum relief can be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and does not substantially impair the intent of
this Ordinance, an adjustment may be considered under the following terms and
conditions. A public hearing shall be ordered by the Board. Notice thereof
shall be given by the secretary of the Board not less than twenty-five days
prior to the date of the public hearing by publishing the notice in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Municipality. Notice shall also be given within
twenty days to the parties having proprietary interest in the land located
within 200 feet of the property in question, as named in the application by
such other means as the granting authority deems appropriate. Failure of any
person, other than the applicant, to receive notice of any hearing or public
hearing shall in no way affect the validity of the action taken. No adjustment
shall be granted unless the Board finds that all of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)    The proposed adjustment will not constitute a change, including an
adjustment in use, on the Zoning Map. In no case shall the Planning Commission
functioning as the Board approve an adjustment for a use which is not a
permitted use in the zoning district in which the property, building or
structure is located.
      (2)    The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building
or land in question are peculiar to such lot or property and do not result from
the actions of the applicant and do not apply generally to other land or
buildings in the vicinity.
      (3)    That the literal interpretation of the provisions of this
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same zoning district under the terms of this Ordinance.
      (4)    The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation
and enjoyment of the substantial property right and not merely to serve as a
convenience to the applicant.
      (5)    That granting the adjustment requested will provide the minimum
necessary relief to alleviate the hardship and will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege which is denied by this Ordinance to other lands,
structures or buildings in the same zoning district.
      (6)    That granting of the adjustment will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
Following disapproval by the Board of an application or request for adjustment
from the literal interpretation of this Ordinance, no subsequent application
requesting the same adjustment shall be filed by any applicant, whether the
same person, firm or corporation, until the expiration of twelve months after
the original or subsequent disapproval.
The Board shall cause to be made a record of all its proceedings, setting forth
its reasons for its decisions. Such record, immediately following the Board’s
decision, shall be filed in the offices of the Board, and shall be open to
public inspection. Appeals from the Board in their decisions on the
administrative error, adjustments, conditional uses, special exceptions and
related matters shall be to the Council of the City of Canfield who shall
conduct a public hearing in compliance with Sections
 1131.05 and take action pursuant to Section
1131.06.
(Ord. 2023-25. Passed 7-12-23.)
   (c)    Conditional Uses. The Board may hear and decide upon, in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance, applications for a conditional use
permit. The purpose of a conditional use permit is to allow a proper
integration into the Municipality of uses which may only be suitable in
specific locations within certain zoning districts or only if such uses are
designed or laid out in a particular manner on the site. A conditional use
permit shall be required for all uses listed as conditionally permitted uses in
Chapter
1141.
      (1)    Application for a conditional use permit shall be made by the
property owner, or agent thereof, to the Board on a form prescribed by the
Municipality, and shall include maps and drawings necessary to demonstrate that
the conditions set forth in Chapter
1151 shall be fulfilled.
      (2)    In considering an application for a conditional use permit, the
Board must make an affirmative finding that the proposed conditional use is to
be located in a district wherein such use may be conditionally permitted, and
that all conditions for approval of conditional uses have been met.
      (3)    The Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all
adjacent uses and structures and the consistency therewith of the proposed
conditional use and any potential nuisances.
         (Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)
      (4)    A public hearing shall be ordered and held by the Board. Notice
thereof shall be given not less than twenty-five days prior to the date of
public hearing by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Municipality.
Notice shall also be given within twenty days to the parties having proprietary
interest in the land located within 200 feet of the property in question by
such other means as the granting authority deems appropriate. Failure of any
person, other than the applicant, to receive notice of any hearing or public
hearing, in no way shall affect the validity of action taken. (Ord. 1973-44.
Passed 12-18-73; Ord. 1977-36. Passed 12-6-77.)
      (5)    Any existing lawful use which is considered as a conditionally
permitted use by this Ordinance, which is located in a zoning district in which
such use is conditionally permitted, shall be considered as a conforming use.
Any expansion of such a conditionally permitted use involving the enlargement
of buildings, structure and/or land area devoted to such conditional use, shall
be subject to the procedures outlined in this section.
      (6)    In any case where an approved conditional use permit has not been
used within six months of the date on which it was granted, the permit shall
expire unless an extension of the above time period has been authorized by the
Board.
         (Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)
   (d)    Contents of Application. Applications for adjustments or conditional
use permit requests shall include at least the following information:
      (1)    Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
      (2)    Location of the property, lot number of the tract and the present
zoning district;
      (3)    Plat layout drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimension
of the lot or parcel and all lots and parcels within 200 feet thereof which
shall be attached to each application;
      (4)    A list of all property owners within 200 feet, contiguous to and
directly across the street from this parcel to be granted the adjustment or
conditional use permit and others that may have a substantial interest in the
case;
      (5)    Specific reason justifying the application for adjustments or
conditional use permit; (Ord. 1992-35. Passed 9-1-92.)
      (6)    A non-refundable fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) payable to
the City to cover administrative costs of the adjustment or conditional use
permit. (Ord. 2020-3. Passed 2-5-20.)

procedure shall be followed:
      (1)   The Committee shall schedule a public hearing on the question of
the proposed designation or listing, setting forth a date, time and place and

organization. The Committee shall cause a legal notice to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City setting forth the nature of the
hearing, the property or district involved, and the date, time and place of the
scheduled public hearing;
      (2)   The Committee shall conduct the public hearing and shall provide a
reasonable opportunity for all interested parties to express their opinions.
Within fifteen days after the hearing, the Committee shall set forth in its
recommendations such findings of fact which constitute the basis for its
decision and shall transmit such recommendations concerning the proposed
designation or listing to Council, which shall follow the review and action
procedures set forth in Section
1129.05, except as provided otherwise herein;
      (3)   Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Committee and the City Planning Commission, as well as
such views as may have been expressed by persons participating in the hearing
before such Commission, in making its determination with respect to the
proposed designation. The City Planning Commission and Council shall follow
review and action procedures established in Section
1129.05;
      (4)   If Council approves the property listing or Historic District, the
Committee shall notify the owner(s) of such decision. In the event the proposed
designation is disapproved by Council, the Committee may, after a period of
sixty days, resubmit the proposal to Council for reconsideration.

(Ord. 2014-31. Passed 8-20-14; Ord. 2023-32. Passed 9-6-23.)
1129.10 METHOD OF OBTAINING APPROVAL.
   When the owner of a property within the Design Review/Historic District or
owner of a listed property intends to construct, reconstruct, alter, relocate
or demolish any portion of a structure within the District or of a listed
property, he shall first apply for and secure an approval from the Committee.
The application for an approval shall be deposited with the City's Zoning
Inspector, together with such plans, specifications and other material as the
Committee may from time to time prescribe.
   (a)   Within thirty days, the Committee shall consider the applications,
plans and specifications, and determine:
      (1)   Whether any "exterior architectural feature" is involved, and
      (2)   Whether a certificate of approval shall be issued or denied. If the
Committee determines that no architectural feature is involved, it shall
approve the request by a majority vote of its members and authorize the Zoning
Inspector to issue a certificate of approval (zoning permit), subject to all
other ordinances of the City.
   (b)   In the event the Committee finds that an architectural feature is
involved, the committee shall determine whether the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition is appropriate or whether it has an
adverse effect upon the purposes of this chapter, the Design Review/Historic
District of listed property. In making such determination, the committee shall
refer to the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and to
the design guidelines adopted by the Committee. When the committee considers a
National Register nomination and other actions (for example, an archaeological
site) which are normally evaluated by a professional in a specific discipline,
and that discipline is not represented on the Committee, the Committee shall
seek expertise in this area before rendering its decision. In the case of
archaeological property, the Committee shall seek professional help from
Youngstown State University.
   (c)   The Committee may require any person applying for a certificate of
approval or request any person whose interests appear adverse to those of the
applicant, to file with the Committee prior to any hearing or determination,
information concerning the applicant's intentions, or such person's adverse
interests or intentions.
   (d)   If the proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition
is determined to have no adverse effect upon the Design Review/Historic
District or listed property, and does not violate the spirit and purpose of
these preservation regulations, then the Committee Secretary shall cause notice
to be given to the Zoning Inspector for the issuance of permits.
   (e)   If the Committee determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect upon the
Design Review/Historic District or listed property, and does violate the spirit
and purpose of these preservation regulations, then the Committee shall deny
approval.
   (f)   In the event that the Committee determines within the thirty day
review period that a certificate of approval shall not be issued, it shall
forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination and may include
recommendations respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any area, place, building, structure site, object
or work of art. The Secretary of the Committee shall forthwith notify the
applicant of such determination and transmit to him a certified copy of the
reasons for denial and recommendations, if any, of the Committee. Any appeal to
a decision of the Committee shall be taken to the Board of Appeals in
accordance with Section
1127.03.
   (g)   Upon denying a certificate of approval, the Committee shall impose a
waiting period of at least thirty days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the committee shall negotiate with the
owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to
both. The first meeting between the Committee and the applicant shall be held
within thirty days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is
accepted by both parties, the Committee may henceforth grant an approval.
   (h)   In the case of denial of an approval for demolition:
      (1)   The Committee and applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of
preserving the property. The Committee and applicant shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the listed property. If the Committee
and applicant do not agree on a means of preserving the structure at the
initial meeting, then they shall continue to undertake meaningful and
continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method of saving the
structure, and such good faith meetings shall be held at least forty-five days
after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Committee in good faith, in
the time specified, then the Committee's denial of the application shall stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Committee, the Committee determines that failure of approval
will create a substantial hardship to the applicant and that such certificate
may be issued without substantial derogation from the purposes of this chapter,
then and in such event, the Secretary of the Committee shall cause notice to
the Zoning Inspector to issue the permit for such proposed construction,
reconstruction or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Committee, no alternative solution to incompatible
construction, reconstruction or alteration is reached, then the applicant may
appeal the decision in accordance with Section
1127.03.
         (Ord. 1993-54. Passed 10-5-93.)
1129.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Failure to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
deemed a violation and the violator shall be liable to a fine of not less than
ten dollars ($10.00) nor greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
day the violation continues.
   (b)   Any person who demolishes, alters, constructs or permits a designated
property to fall into a serious state of disrepair in violation of this
chapter, shall be required to restore this property and its site to its
appearance prior to its violation. Any action to enforce this subsection shall
be brought forth by the City Attorney. This civil remedy shall be in addition
to and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty.
(Ord. 1993-54. Passed 10-5-93.)

1139.01 DISTRICTS GENERALLY.
   The following descriptions refer only to the general intent of the zoning
districts contained in this Zoning Ordinance. The specific descriptions and
requirements for each zoning district are contained in Chapter
1141 and Chapters
1149 through Chapters
1169.
   (a)    Regular Zoning Districts:
      (1)    A-1 Agricultural District. The A-1 Agricultural District protects
the decreasing supply of agricultural land and natural open space by
controlling of urban development into agricultural areas while providing for
low density residential development compatible with certain uses.
      (2)   R-1 Single-Family Residential District. The R-1 Residential
District reserves certain land areas for relatively large lot, single-family
dwellings reflecting both existing residential development as well as providing
additional areas for future low-density single-family residences.
      (3)    R-2 Single-Family Residential District. The R-2 Residential
District designates areas for low density, single-family residential
development on average size lots reflecting the pattern of certain existing
developed areas within the community, as well as providing areas for future low
density development of single-family residences.
      (4)    R-3 Single-Family Residential District. The R-3 Residential
District provides areas for low-medium density, single-family residential
development on less than average size lots reflecting some existing developed
areas within the community, as well as designating areas for future medium-low
density development of single-family residences.
      (5)    R-4 Two-Family Residential District. The R-4 Residential District
designates areas for medium density residential development of both detached
single-family dwellings and two-family semi-detached dwellings allowing
residential development at a slightly higher than average density, thereby
permitting a degree of development flexibility while maintaining the overall
single-family character of the Municipality.
      (6)    R-5 Three to Four-Family Residential District. The purpose of the
R-5 Residential District is to provide areas within the community for the
development of three to four-family multiple-family housing at medium
densities, 8, 000 square feet per dwelling unit, in locations which are well
suited to this level of development on parcels which do not lend themselves to
more conventional multiple-family development due to their physical features
and/or location within the community. This type of development shall be planned
in accordance with specified design procedures requiring development plan
approval, thereby encouraging quality development that will serve to maintain
the residential integrity of the community.
      (7)    R-6 Three to Four-Family Residential District. The R-6 Residential
District designates areas for three to four-family multiple family housing at
medium-high density, 6,000 square feet per dwelling unit, in locations which
are well suited to this level of development on parcels which do not lend
themselves to more conventional multiple-family development. This type of
development shall be planned in accordance with specific design procedures
requiring development plan approval, thereby encouraging quality development
that will serve to maintain the residential integrity of the community.
      (8)    R-7 Multiple-Family Residential District. The purpose of the R-
7 Residential District is to reflect the existing pattern of multiple-family
development within the Municipality, and to designate additional areas for
medium-high density, 4,000 square feet per dwelling unit, development of
multiple-family housing in strategic locations which are well suited to this
development in accordance with specified design procedures requiring
development plan approval, thereby encouraging quality development that will
serve to maintain the residential integrity of the community.
         (Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)
      (9)    R-PUD Planned Unit Development District. The Planned Unit
Development District establishes a permissive zoning procedure for the
development of new tracts of residential development on a planned unit basis in
accordance with an overall development plan. The intent is to be flexible in
the regulation of the basic land planning and to encourage imaginative site
planning that provides both a variety of dwelling types and lot sizes and
usable common open space as an integral part of the development.
         (Ord. 1989-12. Passed 4-18-89.)
      (10)    R-MHP Mobile Home Park District. The R-MHP District establishes a
zoning district, application procedure and specific design standards for the
development of mobile home parks within the community.
      (11)    Residential, Office and Limited Commercial District. The
Residential, Office and Limited Commercial District is designed to provide
areas which will permit and encourage the orderly transition between
residential and commercial uses in the community. The intent is to permit
residential dwellings and certain limited office uses along primary and/or
secondary thoroughfare frontage. These higher intensity uses reflect the higher
level development pressures in certain areas. In the older, built-up areas
which may be subject to transition, some of the lower density residential uses
can be converted or redeveloped to certain types of residential uses or offices
which remain residential in character. On vacant undeveloped land there is an
opportunity to structure the new development along those thoroughfares where
higher intensity usage is justified.
      (12)    O-Office District. The purpose of the O-District is to designate
areas for business and professional offices and related activities thereby
providing for the transition between intensively developed commercial and/or
industrial uses and the residential areas of the community.
      (13)    B-1 Village Green Commercial District. The Village Green
Commercial District reflects the existing, built-up commercial area located
around the Village Green that historically functioned as the geographic
commercial, administrative and office center of the community. Community,
commercial, business, financial and professional offices, and public, quasi-
public uses are located within this district. The intent is to allow for the
gradual expansion of the various uses within the Village Green area providing
flexibility to permit the continuation of this area as the center of the City.
      (14)    B-2 General Commercial District. The General Commercial District
is to accommodate both extensive commercial uses that require large lots,
usually for display, sales/service and/or outdoor storage purposes that require
highway or thoroughfare frontage for visibility and ready accessibility, such
as automobile sales/service facilities, agricultural implement sales, equipment
sales and rentals, building materials sales, commercial restaurants, and
similar general commercial uses which serve people who come from a sizeable
trade area which may extend beyond the community in which they are located.
      (15)    B-3 Highway Commercial District. The intent of the B-3 Highway
Commercial District is to accommodate typically highway oriented commercial
uses that derive a significant part of their trade because of their location
along major highways, such as community shopping centers, branch or drive-in
banks, offices, commercial recreation, e.g. bowling alleys, restaurants,
automobile service stations, motels and similar highway commercial uses.
      (16)    M-1 Manufacturing District. The Manufacturing District is
intended to reflect the existing pattern of manufacturing establishments
located within the community and to delineate new land to permit future
expansion and provide for new manufacturing, warehousing and related
development. The intent is to designate those lands which are suitable for this
type of development in terms of their location in relation to surrounding non-
manufacturing land uses, accessibility and the availability of the utilities
and services required in their operation, thereby resulting in the development
of manufacturing and related uses which are relatively free from objectionable
influences caused by their location, operation and appearance.
   (b)   Special Zoning Districts. The S Special District is to designate
certain land areas that are public in nature such as schools or churches; to
preserve historic areas of the community; and to conserve parkland and open
space.
      (Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73; Ord. 2023-44. Passed 11-15-23.)
   (c)   In all business districts, only one commercial use shall be permitted
on each lot except as specifically provided in this Ordinance. Additionally, no
Business, whether temporary or permanent, may be conducted on vacant lots in
the City.
      (Ord. 2018-36. Passed 11-21-18.)

specified in subsection (b) hereof, the minimum regulations for a conditionally
permitted use shall be the same as the principal permitted use in the district

   (a)   Recommend approval of the preliminary PUD plan and zone change
request.
   (b)   Recommend approval with certain modifications, revisions or
restrictions.
   (c)   Recommend disapproval of the preliminary PUD plan and zone change
request.
      (Ord. 1992-30. Passed 8-4-92.)
1155.14 COUNCIL PUBLIC HEARING.
   Within thirty days of the receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation,
Council shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary PUD plan and zone change
request. Notice of the hearing shall be published at least fifteen days prior
to the hearing date. Hearing notice requirements shall follow the rules
established in Section
4.13 of the Charter.
(Ord. 1992-30. Passed 8-4-92.)
1155.15 COUNCIL ACTION.
   Within thirty (30) days after the hearing date, Council shall take action
regarding the preliminary PUD plan and zone change request. In considering the
PUD proposal, Council shall evaluate those same factors considered by the
Planning Commission in Section
1155.12.
   If the Commission recommends approval of the PUD, approval by Council
requires only three-fifths majority vote. If Council adds or deletes
modifications or limitations and thus changes the preliminary plan approved by
the Commission, passage requires a three-fifths majority vote of Council.
   If the Commission recommends disapproval of the PUD, passage by Council
requires a three-fifths majority.
   Approval of the preliminary PUD plan and zone change request shall be
limited to the general acceptability of the land uses proposed, the general
arrangement of the development and the interrelationship of uses and the
density level. The approval does not endorse precise locations of uses, exact
parcel configuration or engineering feasibility. Approval of the preliminary
PUD plan and zone change request shall constitute the creation of a separate R-
PUD District. The R-PUD District is applicable only to the specific approved
preliminary PUD plan. Any new preliminary PUD plan or any major changes to the
approved plan shall require reconsideration by the Commission and by Council.
   At the time of adopting any ordinance establishing an R-PUD District,
Council shall make appropriate arrangements with the owner/developer which will
ensure the accomplishment of the public improvements and reservation of the
common open space as shown on the approved preliminary PUD plan.
(Ord. 1992-30. Passed 8-4-92.)
1155.16 FINAL PUD PLAN SUBMITTAL.
   The owner/developer shall submit a final PUD plan to the Planning Commission
within one year of Council's approval of the PUD zone change. If no final PUD
plan is submitted within one year, the PUD zone change shall become null and
void and the property shall revert to its former zoning classification.
(Ord. 1992-30. Passed 8-4-92.)
1155.17 REQUIRED CONTENTS OF THE FINAL PUD PLAN.

the detailed final PUD plan. The detailed final PUD plan shall be reviewed and
approved by the Planning Commission and Council prior to the issuance of any
zoning certificate by the Zoning Inspector. When the individual stage being
reviewed is located within the D-Design Area or Historical Area as shown on the
Design Area Map or Historical Area Map, the Design Review Committee and/or
Historical Preservation Area Review Committee shall participate in the review
process with the Commission.
   The detailed final PUD plan shall be prepared for the owner/developer and
shall bear the original signature and/or original seal of the professionally
competent professional engineer, architect or landscape architect; shall be in
accordance with the approved preliminary PUD plan; and shall include the
following:
   (a)   Survey of the tract to be developed showing existing physical
features, general topography, drainage ways and tree cover and streets,
easements and utility lines.
   (b)   Detailed site plans showing lot lines, building outlines, off-street

1155.18 PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY ON THE FINAL PUD PLAN.
   The Planning Commission has the authority to approve the final PUD plan only
if the final PUD plan is in conformance with the preliminary PUD plan approved
by Council. Additional factors to be considered by the Commission shall
include:
   (a)   That the proposed detailed final PUD plan for the individual section
of the overall R-PUD District is in conformance with the approved preliminary
PUD plan and the Comprehensive Plan map and text of the Municipality.
   (b)   That each individual stage of the planned unit development can exist
as an independent planned unit development which is capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability, or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective can be obtained.

PUD plan and zone change request shall constitute the creation of a separate I-
PUD District. The I-PUD District is applicable only to the specific approved
preliminary I-PUD plan. Any new preliminary I-PUD plan or any major changes to
the approved plan shall require reconsideration by the Commission and by
Council.
   At the time of adopting any ordinance establishing an R-PUD District,
Council shall make appropriate arrangements with the owner/developer which will
ensure the accomplishment of the public improvements and reservation of the
common open space as shown on the approved preliminary I-PUD plan.
(Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
 
1156.20 FINAL I-PUD PLAN SUBMITTAL.
   The owner/developer shall submit a final I-PUD plan to the Planning
Commission within one year of Council's approval of the I-PUD zone change. If
no final I-PUD plan is submitted within one year, the I-PUD zone change shall
become null and void and the property shall revert to its former zoning
classification.
(Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.21 REQUIRED CONTENTS OF THE FINAL I-PUD PLAN.
   Once the I-PUD Zoning District and the preliminary PUD plan have been
approved by Council, the owner/developer shall proceed with the preparation of
the detailed final I-PUD plan. The detailed final I-PUD plan shall be reviewed
and approved by the Planning Commission and Council prior to the issuance of
any zoning certificate by the Zoning Inspector. When the individual stage being
reviewed is located within the D-Design Area or Historical Area as shown on the
Design Area Map, the Design Review Committee and/or Historical Preservation
Area Review Committee shall participate in the review process with the
Commission.
   The detailed final I-PUD plan shall be prepared for the owner/developer and
shall bear the original signature, and/or original seal of the professionally
competent professional engineer, architect or landscape architect; shall be in
accordance with the approved preliminary I-PUD plan; and shall include the
following:
   (a)    Survey of the tract to be developed showing existing physical
features, general topography, drainage ways and tree cover and streets,
easements and utility lines.
   (b)    Detailed site plans showing lot lines, building outlines, off-street
parking spaces, pedestrian walkways and vehicular circulation.
   (c)    Preliminary building plans, including floor plans and exterior
elevations.
   (d)    Landscaping plans including quantity, size and varieties of
landscaping.
   (e)    Specific detailed engineering plans, including site grading, street
improvements, drainage and utility improvements, and extensions as necessary.
   (f)   All necessary legal documentation relating to the organization of the
legal entity created for the purpose of maintaining the required common open
space included within the planned unit development.
   (g)    Copies of any restrictive covenants that are to be recorded.
   After submittal the Commission may make suggestions to the owner/developer
regarding modifications which would improve the likelihood of approval of the
final I-PUD plan. The owner/developer may modify the final I-PUD plan before a
final action is taken by the Commission. The owner/developer may withdraw the
submission of the final I-PUD plan if additional time is needed for the
modifications.
(Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.22 PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY ON THE FINAL I-PUD PLAN.
   The Planning Commission has the authority to approve the final I-PUD plan
only if the final I-PUD plan is in conformance with the preliminary I-PUD plan
approved by Council. Additional factors to be considered by the Commission
shall include:
   (a)    That the proposed detailed final I-PUD plan for the individual
section of the overall I-PUD District is in conformance with the approved
preliminary I-PUD plan and the Comprehensive Plan map and text of the
Municipality.
   (b)    That each individual stage of the planned unit development can exist
as an independent planned unit development which is capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective can be obtained.
   (c)    That any part of the planned unit development not used for
structures, parking and loading areas or streets, shall be grassed, landscaped
or otherwise improved, or if approved by the Commission, left in its natural
state.
   (d)    That any exception from the standard requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the detailed
final I-PUD plan, in accordance with the adopted policy of the Commission and
Council.
   (e)    That the internal private drives proposed are suitable and adequate
to accommodate the anticipated traffic within and through the development.
   (f)   That the detailed final I-PUD plan is consistent with the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance to promote public health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the Municipality
      (Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.23 MAJOR CHANGES.
   The Planning Commission may not approve the final I-PUD plan if it is
determined that the final plan includes major changes from the preliminary I-
PUD plan. Major changes shall include, but are not limited to:
   (a)    An increase in overall density.
   (b)    Changes in the outside boundaries of the planned unit development
landholding.
   (c)    Changes in the location or amount of land designated for specific
land uses, including open space.
   (d)    Changes in the internal private street locations or alignments.
      (Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.24 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION ON THE FINAL I-PUD PLAN.
   Within forty-five days of the formal submittal of the final I-PUD plan, the
Planning Commission shall, by motion, make a decision regarding the final I-PUD
plan. In making this decision, the Commission shall, by motion, determine that
either:
   (a)    The final I-PUD plan is in basic conformance with the Preliminary I-
PUD plan and meets the requirements of Section
1156.22 and is approved
   (b)    The final I-PUD plan includes major changes from the preliminary I-
PUD plan or otherwise fails to meet the requirements of Section
1156.23 and is disapproved. In its written response to the owner/developer, the
Commission shall identify the major changes or other problems in question. The
owner/developer may revise the final I-PUD plan to bring it into conformance
with the approved preliminary I-PUD plan and formally resubmit it for
reconsideration by the Commission.
      (Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.25 APPEAL OF A PLANNING COMMISSION DETERMINATION ON A FINAL I-PUD PLAN.
   If the Planning Commission disapproves the final I-PUD plan, the owner/
developer may submit a written appeal of the Commission's decision to Council.
Approval of the final I-PUD plat by Council shall require a majority vote
thereof. However, Council may not approve a final I-PUD plan which includes a
major change as defined in Section
1156.23.
(Ord. 2003-01. Passed 1-2-03.)
1156.26 SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS APPLICATION.
   All planned unit developments are subject to the Subdivision Regulations of
the City. All subdivisions within approved I-PUD Districts shall be reviewed
and approved by the Planning Commission to determine that the subdivision meets
all requirements and is in conformance with the approved final I-PUD plan.
   A subdivider’s agreement shall be fully executed before the final I-PUD plan
is approved by Council. As a part of the subdivider's agreement, the subdivider
shall submit a subdivision bond or an irrevocable special letter of credit (See
Appendix E of the Subdivision Regulations) whichever shall be required by the
City Manager and the City Engineer based on the total estimated costs, as
determined by the City Engineer, of the required public improvements.
   The City by and through Council, reserves the right to reject any
subdivision bond or irrevocable special letter of credit which it determines to
be unacceptable.

1161.04 PARKING AND LOADING DESIGN-STANDARDS.
   (a)   Dimension. Each parking stall shall be a minimum size of ten feet by
twenty feet exclusive of aisles, drives and obstructions. Aisles shall be
twenty-four feet minimum for two-way traffic with parking on both sides and
twenty feet minimum for one-way traffic with parking on one or both sides.
However, where the principal structure on the lot served by the aisle way is a
residential structure, aisles of twelve foot minimum for two way traffic with
parking on both sides and ten foot minimum for one way traffic with parking on
one or both sides shall be allowed. Head-in parking should allow three feet of
car overhanging adjacent to a building or curb. Rear overhang normally amounts
to four and one-half feet.
      (1)   In all cases, a minimum clear distance of three feet shall be
provided when parking is adjacent to a building.
      (2)   Each off-street loading space for over the road tractor trailers
shall include a twelve foot wide stall, sixty foot stall depth, sixty foot
maneuvering apron and a fifteen foot vertical clearance. For City delivery
trucks, a twelve foot stall width, thirty foot depth, thirty foot apron and a
twelve foot vertical clearance shall be provided.
      (3)   Driveways having relatively high volumes of large trucks shall be
provided with radii of twenty-five feet plus widths of thirty to forty feet so
that entry and exit can be made without encroachment beyond the curb lane of
the abutting street.
   (b)   Surfacing. All open parking and loading spaces, except a required
parking space accessory to a single-family dwelling, shall be graded and
provided with a hard surface of bituminous asphalt or Portland cement concrete.
All paved areas shall be separated from all unpaved areas by six inch high
curbing.
   (c)   Drainage. All open, off-street parking and loading areas shall be
provided with adequate drainage facilities as approved by the Municipal
Engineer, in order to ensure that storm water does not flow onto abutting
property or abutting sidewalks in such a way or quantity that adjoining owners
or users of the sidewalk would be detrimentally affected or inconvenienced.
   (d)   Screening and Landscaping.  
      (1)   When any open off-street parking or loading area used for any
nonresidential purpose containing more than two spaces is not separated from a
residential district by a dedicated street, an effective buffer or screen,
consisting of a solid wall, fence, landscaped earth mound or view- obscuring
dense planting of evergreen shrubs, hedge tree-line, mass tree planting or
various combinations thereof, shall be provided at the lot lines adjoining such
residential district to protect the privacy of the adjoining residential uses.
Such wall, fence or earth mound, shall be not less than four feet or more than
six feet in height, or may be higher if necessary to provide visual privacy for
the adjacent residential property owner, and shall be maintained in good
condition by the owner. Exception to this height requirement occurs at the
immediate exit point from the parking or loading area as shown in Section
1161.01(g).
      (2)   Where the principal structure served by a parking area is a
residential structure, parking shall be prohibited in the front yard area. In
other instances where required parking areas are developed in the front yard or
along street frontage, a fifteen foot planting area shall be provided between
the property line and the parking area. Such planting area shall be planted
with grass or evergreen ground cover and shall be landscaped with flowers,
trees and/or shrubs and be maintained in good condition by the owner. Plantings
which are diseased or dead shall be removed and replaced with healthy
specimens.
      (3)   All off-street parking or loading areas which provide parking
spaces for fifteen vehicles or more shall have planting areas incorporated into
their design. A minimum area equal to five percent of the total paved parking
lot area shall be provided, with no individual planting area consisting of less
than 200 square feet, or having a minimum dimension less than ten feet. Such
areas shall be located so as to break up the visual appearance of the parking
lot, and shall be shown on the plans which are submitted by the applicant for a
zoning certificate, application for development plan approval or conditional
use permit in accordance with the provisions specified in this Zoning
Ordinance. All such planting areas shall be separated from paved areas by means
of a six inch high curb.
      (4)   All open off-street parking or loading areas which are unusable,
either for parking or for traffic, shall be landscaped with plantings of grass,
flowers, shrubs and/or trees, which shall be maintained in good condition by
the owner. Plantings which are diseased or dead shall be removed and replaced
with healthy specimens. All tree lawns shall be landscaped and/or planted with
grass, and maintained in good condition by the owner, in such a way as to
clearly distinguish their separation from adjacent public streets or private
drives.

receive a notice of violation in compliance with Section
1125.04(e). The notice shall state the nature of the violation and identify the
measures necessary to correct the violation. The notice shall also state that
there shall be no further warnings for subsequent violations and that any
subsequent violations shall cause a citation to be issued and penalties levied
in accordance with Section
1133.99. The Zoning Inspector shall not be required to comply with the notice
provisions of Section
1125.04 for violations subsequent to the initial notification of a violation of
subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   For purposes of this section, “mobile storage unit” shall mean any
device or item on wheels, skids, rollers or blocks, or which is otherwise
designed to be mobile and used to store, deposit or accumulate personal
property. Notwithstanding the above, “mobile storage unit” shall not include
portable trash or construction debris receptacles temporarily placed on a
property during construction, remodeling or reconstruction on the property.

lawfully existing prior to the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, which are
prohibited or further restricted as a result of the provisions adopted in this

incompatible with the permitted uses of the zoning district in which the
nonconforming uses are located.
   (c)   Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be construed to require any
changes to be made in the plans, construction, excavation or demolition, or
designated use of any building, structure or use on which actual construction
was lawfully begun, or for which plans were officially approved by the
Municipality prior to the date of adoption of this Ordinance.
      (1)    Actual construction includes projects already under construction,
whereby materials have been placed on the site and fastened together in a
permanent manner; where excavation of a site has begun; or where demolition of
a building to make way for rebuilding has begun, provided such construction,
excavation or demolition and subsequent rebuilding shall be carried on
diligently.
      (2)    Officially approved plans shall include preliminary and final
subdivision plans which have been approved by the Municipality prior to the
adoption of this Ordinance.
   (d)   All nonconforming buildings, structures or uses of land which were

kept in repair.
   (e)   Any nonconforming building, structure or use of land which is
superseded by a use which is permitted within the zoning district in which it
is located shall thereafter be in conformance with this Ordinance, and the
previous nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
   (f)   Any nonconforming use, building or structure which has been
discontinued for a period of twelve consecutive months, or any nonconforming
use of land which has been discontinued for a period of ninety consecutive

located shall not be extended, enlarged, constructed, restored, reconstructed,
moved or structurally altered without approval by City Council subsequent to a
recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission acting as the Board of

percent (75%) of the structure shall require City Council approval subsequent
to Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation, along with Design Review
Committee approval, if necessary.
   (h)   Any building, structure or use of land which is devoted to a use which
is not permitted by this Ordinance in the zoning district in which it is
located shall not be changed in use in any manner whatsoever from the specific
use existing prior to the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance without approval by
City Council after a recommendation by the Planning and Zoning Commission, and
after a public hearing has been held by City Council, except for a change in
use to a use which is permitted and in conformance with the regulations of this
Ordinance.
   (i)   The approval provisions of subsections (g) and (h) hereof and any

(Ord. 1994-12. Passed 3-1-94.)
1165.02 NON-CONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.

Adjustment of the specified yard requirements shall be obtained only through
the granting of an adjustment by the Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)
1165.03 CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES NOT CONSIDERED NON- CONFORMING USES.
   Any use of a specific property which is conditionally permitted in a zoning
district in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall not
be considered as a nonconforming use in the zoning district to which it is
conditionally permitted. Such conditionally permitted use shall be considered a
conforming use on the particular lot on which it is located.
(Ord. 1973-44. Passed 12-18-73.)

1309.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Canfield, State of Ohio, does ordain
as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of Canfield has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Canfield as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Canfield.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective November 18, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Canfield as required by Section
1309.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 104 Lisbon Street Canfield, Ohio 44406.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Canfield, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 2009-
44. Passed 8-12-09.)

flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Canfield's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
   (v)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   (w)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   (x)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (y)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (z)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (aa)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (bb)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (cc)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Canfield Flood
Insurance Rate Map, November 1, 1978, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (dd)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's
Department, or any court.
   (ee)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (hh)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ii)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (jj)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (kk)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ll)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (mm)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (nn)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (oo)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 2009-44. Passed 8-12-09.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Canfield flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1309.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1309.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1309.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1309.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of the
City of Canfield, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Canfield have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Canfield Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Canfield
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Canfield suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Canfield has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1309.05.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 2009-44. Passed 8-12-09.)

1309.04(d).
   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1309.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of the City of Canfield and
the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1309.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Canfield specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1309.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2009-44. Passed 8-12-09.)
1309.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Canfield Planning Commission is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City Code.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
City Hall at 104 Lisbon Street Canfield, Ohio 44406.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1309.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 20 days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1309.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 2009-44. Passed 8-12-09.)
1309.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1309.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1309.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in

1311.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2002, and as
identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC).
1311.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1311.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. No building or its equipment or accessories, to which the rules of
the Board of Building Standards apply shall be erected, constructed, or
installed, except in conformity with the rules of the Board. Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, of any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
1311.04  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.
(ORC 3791.01, 3791.02)
   (b)   No architect, builder, engineer, plumber, carpenter, mason,
contractor, subcontractor, foreman or employee shall violate or assist in
violating this chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building

approved, or the industrialized unit has been inspected at the point of origin.
(ORC 3791.04)
1311.05 EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code shall control the
alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of
this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
1311.06 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Adjudication Orders Required Before Legal Proceedings. Before the
Municipality attempts to enforce Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1311.07. Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board. The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board. Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1311.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1311.07 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease
work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
