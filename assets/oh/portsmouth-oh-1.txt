ADOPTING ORDINANCE
Year - 1990 Number  -78-
   Approving, adopting and enacting the 1990 Codified Ordinances of the City of
Portsmouth, Ohio.
   WHEREAS, Twenty-two years have elapsed since the ordinances were last
recodified and a change in governmental structure has necessitated that the
ordinances be recodified at the present time; and
   WHEREAS, The City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council as outlined in Mayor's Council Letter No. 90-72; and
   WHEREAS, At least four of the six members elected to Council have found,
considered and determined that there exists an imperative necessity for the
earliest publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the
officials and residents of the City, so as to facilitate administration, daily
operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements. Now, therefore,
   BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Portsmouth, Ohio:
   SECTION 1. The ordinances of the City of Portsmouth, Ohio of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into

enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Portsmouth, Ohio, 1990.
   SECTION II. The provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in

enacted prior to March 26, 1990, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Portsmouth Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Portsmouth Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   In the year 1953, upon the making of any such levy by the Council, and prior
to the time when the first tax collection from such levy can be made, the
Council may anticipate a fraction of the proceeds of such levy and issue
anticipation notes in an amount not to exceed $200,000.00.
   In case such anticipation notes are issued, they shall mature one-half in
not more than one year, and one-half in not more than two years from the date
thereof, and they shall be sold as provided in the Uniform Bond Act. Such notes
may be issued subject to call and redemption prior to maturity, at not more
than par and accrued interest.
   If such notes are issued the amount necessary to pay the interest and
principal thereof shall be deemed appropriated for such purpose from such levy,
and appropriations from such levy by the Council shall be limited for the years
1954 and 1955 to the balance available in excess of the amount required to pay
the principal and interest on the note or notes falling due in each of said
years.
   Provided, however, that after the year 1953, Council shall have no authority
to issue anticipation notes against such levy, except such authority as is
given by the laws of Ohio to borrow during any current year in anticipation of
the semi-annual tax settlement by the County Auditor for that year.
   So long as this section and these powers are in effect, the levying by
Council of a tax on incomes or on payrolls is hereby expressly prohibited.

Within a period of ten (10) days after the receipt of such proposed
appropriation ordinance the Council may provide for public hearings thereon to
be held either before a committee of the Council or before the Council sitting

expenses of the City until the annual appropriation ordinance is in force. The
aggregate of any such preliminary appropriations shall not be more than one-
sixth of the total of the appropriations proposed for the year in the draft of

   The Council may at any time transfer an unencumbered balance of an
appropriation to a purpose or object for which the appropriation for the

transfer shall be made of the income of earnings of any public utility owned by
the City, and receiving no support from taxation, to any other purpose than
such utility.
SECTION 52. APPROPRIATIONS OF EXCESS REVENUE.
   If at any time the total accruing revenue of the City shall be in excess of
the total estimated income thereof, as set forth in the annual budget in
compliance with subdivisions (7) and (8) of Section
48 of this Charter, the Council may from time to time appropriate such excess
to such uses as will not conflict with any uses for which specifically such
revenues accrued.
SECTION 53. EXPENDITURES ONLY PURSUANT TO APPROPRIATIONS.
   No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the City, nor shall any
obligation for the expenditure of money be incurred except in pursuance of the
annual appropriation ordinance, any preliminary appropriation ordinance passed
in accordance with Section
50 of this Charter, or of the annual appropriation ordinance when changed as
authorized by Section
51 hereof and the proceeds from the sale of notes or bonds issued for a special
purpose. At the close of each fiscal year any unencumbered balance of an
appropriation shall revert to the fund from which appropriated and be subject
to re-appropriation; but appropriations may be made by the Council, to be paid

shall have been accomplished or abandoned.

charged against it, and the unencumbered balance to the credit thereof.
SECTION 55. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY.
   No claim against the City shall be paid except by means of a warrant on the
Treasury issued by the City Auditor, who shall issue no such warrant unless the
claim be evidenced by a voucher approved by the head of the department or
office for which the indebtedness was incurred, and countersigned by the City
Manager; and each such officer and his surety shall be liable to the City for
all loss or damage sustained by reason of his negligent or corrupt approval of
any claim.
(Amended 11-8-11)
SECTION 56. EXAMINATION AND INVESTIGATION OF CLAIMS.
   The City Auditor shall examine all payrolls, bills and other claims against
the City and shall issue no warrant for payment unless he finds that the claim
is in proper form, correctly computed and duly approved; that it is legally due
and payable; that an appropriation has been made therefor which has not been
exhausted; and that there is money in the Treasury to make payment. He may
investigate any claim and for that purpose may summon before him any officer,
agent or employee of the City, any claimant or other person, and examine him
upon oath or affirmation relative thereto, and if he find a claim to be
fraudulent, erroneous, or otherwise invalid, he shall not issue a warrant
therefor.
SECTION 57. MONEY REQUIRED TO BE IN TREASURY.
   No contract agreement, or other obligation, involving the expenditure of
money out of appropriations made by the Council, shall be entered into, nor
shall any order for such expenditure be valid unless the City Auditor shall
first certify to the Council that the money required for such contract,
agreement or obligation is in the Treasury to the credit of the appropriation
from which it is to be drawn, and that it is otherwise unencumbered. The
certificate of the City Auditor shall be filed and made a matter of record in
his office, and the sum so certified as being in the Treasury shall not
thereafter be considered unencumbered until the City is discharged from the
contract, agreement, or obligation. All unencumbered moneys actually in the
Treasury to the credit of the appropriation from which an obligation is to be
paid, and all moneys applicable to its payment which, before the maturity
thereof, are anticipated to come into the Treasury to the credit of such
appropriation shall, for the purpose of such certificate, be deemed in the
Treasury to the credit of the appropriation from which the obligation is to be
paid.
SECTION 58. WHEN CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS ARE INVALID.
   All contracts, agreements, or other obligations entered into, all ordinances
and resolutions passed and orders adopted, contrary to the provisions of
Section
57 of this Charter shall be void, and no person shall have any claim or demand
whatever against the City thereunder nor shall the Council or any officer of
the City waive or qualify the limitations fixed by such section or fasten upon
the City any liability whatever in excess of such limits.
SECTION 59. ACCOUNTS OF PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES.
   Accounts shall be kept for each public utility owned or operated by the
City, distinct from other City accounts and in such manner as to show the
complete financial results of such City ownership, or ownership and operation,
including all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These accounts shall
show the actual costs to the City of each public utility owned; the cost of all
extensions, additions and improvements; all expenses of maintenance; the amount
set aside for sinking fund purposes, and, in the case of City operation, all
operation expenses of every description. They shall show as nearly as possible
the value of any service furnished to or rendered by any such public utility by
or to any other City or governmental department or office. They shall also show
a proper allowance for depreciation, insurance, interest on the investment, and
estimates of the amount of taxes that would be chargeable against the property
if privately owned. The Council shall annually cause to be made and printed for
public information a report showing the financial results of such City
ownership, or ownership and operation, which report shall give the information

estimates have been submitted by the department or office authorized to execute
such work or improvement, and there shall be separate accounting as to each
work or improvement so executed. All the contracts for public work or
improvements shall be awarded to the lowest and best responsible bidder, after
public advertisement and competition as may be prescribed by ordinance, but the
City Manager shall have the power to reject any and all bids and advertise
again. All advertisements as to such contracts shall contain a reservation of
the foregoing right. Contracts entered into by the City shall be signed by the
City Manager or by such other officer, or officers, of the City as the Council
may by ordinance provide. (Amended 11-8-11)

   Whenever, in the prosecution of any work or improvement under contract, it
becomes necessary in the opinion of the City Manager to make alterations in
such contract, such alterations may be made by the City Manager only when extra
work and materials are provided for in the original contract. In all other such
contracts no alterations shall be made therein unless authorized by Council
upon the written recommendation of the City Manager. No such alteration shall
be valid unless the new price to be paid for any supplies, material or work
under the altered contract shall have been agreed upon in writing and signed by
the contractor and the City Manager, prior to such authorization when required.

constituting the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have power to determine
all complaints and objections submitted to it; and as to each improvement, the
Board shall, after such hearing, amend, equalize and adjust the assessment
report, and shall report to the Council its findings as to the necessity for
the improvement, any amendment it directs in the assessments, the estimates of
benefits and allowance of damages.
(Amended 11-5-02; 11-8-11)
SECTION 96. CLAIMS OF DAMAGE.
   Any owner of a lot or land bounding and abutting upon a proposed improvement
claiming that he will sustain damage by reason of the improvement shall present
such claim to the board of revision of assessments within two weeks after the
service of notice or the completion of the publication hereinbefore provided.
Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the amount of damage
claimed, with a general description of the property with respect to which it is
claimed the damage will accrue, and shall be filed with the City Auditor. Any
owner who fails so to do shall be deemed to have waived such damages and shall
be barred from filing a claim or receiving damages therefor. This provision
shall apply to all damage which will obviously result from the improvement, but
shall not deprive the owner of his right to recover damages arising, without
his fault, from acts of the City or of its agents. If, subsequent to the filing
of such claim, the owner sell the property, or any part thereof, the right to
such damages, if any, shall follow the ownership of the land without other
transference of the claim. The board of revision of assessments shall report to
the Council all such claims for damages filed with it.
SECTION 97. FINAL ASSESSMENT.
   Whenever the board of revision of assessments shall have made its final
report to the Council as to any improvement, the Council, if it determine that
the improvement shall proceed, shall pass an ordinance levying the assessment
as reported by the board of revision of assessments and directing that the
improvement shall proceed. In such ordinance it shall be sufficient to describe
the lots and lands abutting upon the improvement, and to be assessed therefor,
as all the lots and lands bounding and abutting upon such improvement between
and including the termini of the improvement; and in describing lands which do
not abut, it shall be sufficient to describe the lots by the appropriate lot
numbers and the lands by metes and bounds. This rule of description shall apply
in all proceedings in which lots and lands are to be charged with special
assessments.
SECTION 98. PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS - LIENS.
   Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed
at the time stipulated in the ordinance and shall be a lien from the date of
the assessment upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed,
enforceable in the manner provided by general law.
SECTION 99. DAMAGES ASSESSED BEFORE IMPROVEMENT.
   At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the
improvements as hereinbefore provided, the Council shall determine whether the
claims for damages so filed shall be allowed and paid or shall be judicially
inquired into before commencing or after the completion of the proposed
improvement. If it decide that the damages shall be assessed before commencing
the improvement, the City Solicitor shall then make a written application to
the Court of Common Pleas, or a judge thereof in vacation, or to the Probate
Court, for the summoning of a jury to determine such damages, and the judge
shall direct that a jury be summoned as is provided for the appropriation of
property and fix the time and place for inquiry into and assessment of such
damages, which inquiry and assessment shall be confined to such claims.
SECTION 100. DAMAGES ASSESSED AFTER IMPROVEMENT.
   When the Council determines to assess the damages after the completion of
the improvement for which a claim for damages has been filed as hereinbefore
provided, the City Solicitor shall within ten days after the completion of the
improvement make written application as hereinbefore provided in the case of
the ascertainment of damages before the improvement was made, and the same
proceedings shall be had as provided in the next preceding section.
SECTION 101. LIMITATION ON DAMAGE SUITS.
   No person who claims damages arising from any cause shall commence a suit
therefor against the City until he shall have filed a claim for such damages
with the City Clerk and sixty days shall have elapsed thereafter. This
provision shall not apply to an application for injunction or other proceeding
to which it may be necessary for such applicant to resort in case of urgent
necessity.
SECTION 102. WORK TO BE DONE.
   When the Council shall have passed an ordinance directing that an
improvement be made to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessment
the City Manager shall, through the appropriate department or office, cause the
improvement to be made either directly by the employment of labor or by
entering into a contract therefor as may be determined by the Council.
(Amended 11-8-11)
SECTION 103. LANDS UNALLOTTED OR NOT ON DUPLICATE.
   When special assessments are to be levied by the percentage of the tax value
of the property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and
abutting upon the improvement and there are lots or lands subject to such
assessment which are not assessed for taxation, the City Auditor shall fix, for
the purpose of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand and of
such lands at the depth which he considers a fair average of the depth of lots
in the neighborhood, so that the value so fixed will be a fair average of the
assessed value of other lots in the neighborhood. Where lands are not
subdivided into lots, but are assessed for taxation, the City Auditor shall fix
the value and depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not apply in
making special assessment according to benefits.
SECTION 104. WHAT COST OF IMPROVEMENT SHALL INCLUDE.
   The cost of any improvement for which special assessments may be made as
herein provided shall include the purchase money of real estate or any interest
therein, when acquired by purchase, or the value thereof as found by the jury,
when appropriated, the costs and expenses of the proceedings, the damages
assessed in favor of any owners of adjoining lands and interest thereon, the
costs and expenses of the assessment, the expense of the preliminary and other
service and of printing, publishing the notices and ordinances required,
including notice of assessment and serving notices on property owners, the cost
of construction, interest on bonds, where bonds have been issued in
anticipation of the collection of assessments, and any other necessary
expenditure.
SECTION 105. LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS. IMPROVEMENT ON PETITION OF ABUTTING
PROPERTY OWNERS.
   The Council shall limit all assessments to the special benefits conferred
upon the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied on any lot or
parcel of land any assessment for any or all purposes within a period of five
years in excess of thirty-three and one-third per cent (33-1/3%) of the actual
value thereof after the improvement is made, provided, however, that when a
petition subscribed by three-fourths in interest of the owners, or the owners
of sixty percent of the foot frontage of the property abutting upon a street,
alley, or highway of any description between designated points in a municipal
corporation, is regularly presented to the Council for that purpose, the entire
cost of any improvement of such street, alley, or highway, including the cost
of intersections and regardless of the limitations of Section
106 of this Charter and without reference to the value of the lands of those
who subscribed such petition, may be assessed and collected in equal annual
installments proportioned to the whole assessment, in a manner which may be
fixed by the Council. The interest on any bonds issued by the corporation,
together with the annual installments herein provided for, and the costs of
such proceedings and assessments, shall be assessed upon the property so
improved. When the lot or land of one who did not subscribe the petition is
assessed, such assessment shall not exceed thirty-three and one-third percent
of the actual value of his lot or land after improvement is made. The guardian
of infants or insane persons may sign such petition on behalf of their wards
only when expressly authorized by the Probate Court on good cause shown.
Assessments levied for the construction of main sewers shall not exceed the sum
that, in the opinion of the Council, would be required to construct an ordinary
street sewer or drain of sufficient capacity to drain or sewer the lots or
lands to be assessed for such improvement, nor shall any lots or lands be
assessed that do not need local drainage, or which are provided therewith.
SECTION 106. CITY'S PORTION OF COST.
   The City shall pay such part of the cost and expense of improvements for
which special assessments are levied as the Council deems just, which part
shall not be less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of all such cost and expense; and in
addition thereto, the City shall pay the cost of intersections except as
hereinbefore provided. The Council may provide for the payment of the City's
portion of all such improvements by the issuance of bonds or notes therefor,
and may levy taxes, in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, to pay
such bonds or notes and the interest thereon.
SECTION 107. REPLACING EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Council may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any
existing local improvement by levying special assessments as hereinbefore
provided; but any assessment for such replacement in less than fifteen years
from the date of a prior assessment for the improvement to be replaced shall be
limited to a sum not in excess of fifty percent of the cost of such
replacement.
SECTION 108. ESTIMATE OF LIFE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every ordinance providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in
part by special assessments shall contain an estimate of the life of the
proposed improvement, prepared as may be directed by the City Manager. Any
assessment thereafter made for replacing such improvement within such estimated
period of life shall be limited to a sum not in excess of fifty percent (50%)
of the cost of such replacement. Assessments for replacements at or after the
expiration of such estimated period of life shall be subject to no limitation
except as provided for assessments for original improvements. (Amended 11-8-11)
SECTION 109. REBATES AND SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS.
   Upon the completion of any improvement the City Auditor shall rebate to the
then owner of the property which shall have been assessed to pay for such
improvement, any surplus or excess remaining unexpended for the purpose for
which such assessment was made, and in the event of there being a deficit in
the fund provided for the making of any such improvement the City Auditor shall
report to the Council a supplementary assessment within the limitations
hereinbefore provided, which supplementary assessment shall be made by
ordinance and certified for collection as is provided in the case of original
assessments.
SECTION 110. SEWER, WATER AND OTHER CONNECTIONS.
   The City Manager, or other officer to whom the duty may be assigned by the
Council, shall have the authority to compel the making of sewer, water, gas and
other connections whenever, in view of contemplated street improvements, or as
a sanitary regulation, such connections should in his judgment be constructed.
Written notice of such determination shall be given to the owner of each lot or
parcel of land to which connections are to be made, which notice shall state
the number and character of connections required. Such notice shall be served
by a person, designated by the City Manager, or other officer, in the manner
provided for the service of summons in civil actions. Non-residents of the
City, or persons who cannot be found, may be served by one publication of such
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The notice shall
state the time within which such connections shall be constructed and, if they
be not constructed within said time, the work may be done by the City and the
cost thereof, together with a penalty of five percent, (5%), assessed against
the lots and lands for which the connections are made. Said assessments shall
be certified and collected in the same manner as other assessments for street
improvements. (Amended 11-8-11)
SECTION 111. SIDEWALKS, CURBINGS AND GUTTERS.
   The Council may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks,
curbings or gutters shall be constructed or repaired. Upon the passage of such
resolution the City Auditor shall cause written notice of the passage thereof
to be served upon the owner, or agent of the owner, of each parcel of land
abutting upon such sidewalks, curbings or gutters who may be a resident of the
City, in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in civil
actions. A copy of the notice, with the time and manner of service endorsed
thereon, signed by the person serving it, shall be returned to the office of
the City Auditor and there filed and preserved. For the purpose of such
service, if the owner of any such property be not a resident of the City, any
person charged with the collection of rent or the payment of taxes upon such
property, or having control thereof in any way, shall be regarded as the agent
of the owner, and service upon such person shall have the like force and effect
as though personal service were made on the owner thereof. If it appear in any
such return that the owner is a non-resident, or that neither such owner or
agent could be found, one publication of a copy of the resolution in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City shall be deemed sufficient notice
to such owner.
SECTION 112. CONSTRUCTION OF SIDEWALK, ETC., BY CITY.
   If sidewalks, curbings or gutters be not constructed or repaired within
thirty days from the service of notice provided for in the preceding sections,
or the completion of the publication thereof, the City may proceed through the
appropriate department or office, either by direct employment of labor, or by
contract, to carry out such construction or repair at the expense of the owner,
as in the case of other improvements, and all such expenses shall be reported
by the City Clerk to the Council. The Council shall thereupon by ordinance
assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owner or owners of all property
bounding or abutting thereon, and such assessment shall be collected in the
same manner as other assessments, with a penalty of five percent and interest
for failure to pay at the time fixed by the assessment resolution.
(Adopted 11-4-75.)
SECTION 113. ASSESSMENT BONDS FOR SIDEWALKS, ETC.
   The Council may at any time borrow money and authorize the issuance of notes
or bonds therefor in anticipation of the collection of assessments, levied for
the purpose of paying the cost of construction or repairing sidewalks, curbings
and gutters which are to be or have been constructed by the City, upon failure
of the owners of the property to construct or repair the same, pursuant to
notice as hereinbefore provided. In all cases not herein provided for, the
Council shall have power to issue notes and bonds in the anticipation of the
collection of special assessments, levied for the purpose of paying that
portion of the estimated cost of the improvement or service for which such
assessments are levied. In the issuance and sale of such notes or bonds the
municipality shall be governed by the provisions of House Bill Number One,
passed by the General Assembly of Ohio on April 21, 1927, approved by the
Governor on May 11, 1927, and recorded in volume 112, page 364 of the Ohio
Laws.
CITY PLANNING COMMISSION
SECTION 114. HOW CONSTITUTED, PROCEDURE AND EMPLOYEES.
   The City Planning Commission shall consist of the City Manager, City
Solicitor, City Engineer or the head of the Engineering Department of the City
by whatever name designated, and two (2) citizens of the City of Portsmouth,
Ohio, appointed by the President of Council, with approval of a majority of
City Council to serve terms of three (3) years each. The Commission shall
choose one of its members as chairman, determine its own rules of procedure,
and may employ a secretary and such experts and employees as may be necessary
and authorized by Council. The Commission shall have power and authority to

   The Commission shall have full power and authority to make such
investigations, maps, reports, and recommendations relating to the planning of
the City as it deems desirable. In particular, it shall have authority, and it
shall be its duty, to make recommendations concerning: (a) the location,
extension, widening, and planning of streets, boulevards, parks, playgrounds,
and other public places; (b) changes in, or vacation of, streets, alleys, or
other public places, and the sale or disposal of any real estate owned by the

City; (i) such State and municipal legislation as may be necessary to carry out
such plans.
SECTION 116. RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMISSION.
   All acts of the Council or of any other branch of the City government
affecting the City plan or involving the duties of the Commission as set forth
in Section
115 of this Charter, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for report
and recommendation. The Commission may, of its own volition, submit to the
Council its recommendation on any matter which in its opinion affects the plan
of the City.
   Any matter referred by the Council to the Planning Commission shall be acted
upon by the Commission within thirty days of the date of reference unless a
longer period of time be specified in the resolution of Council in making such
reference. No action by the Council involving any of the matters set forth in
Section
115 of this Charter, shall be legal or binding until said matter shall have
been referred to the Commission and until its recommendations thereon shall
have been presented to the Council, unless the Commission shall have failed to
present its recommendations to the Council within the time specified.
SECTION 117. PLAT OF SUBDIVISION.
   A proprietor of lots or grounds within the City, who subdivides or lays them
out for sale, shall cause to be made an accurate map or plat of such
subdivision, describing with certainty all grounds laid out or granted for
streets, alleys, ways, commons, or other public uses. Lots sold or intended for
sale shall be numbered by progressive numbers, or described by the squares in
which situated, and the precise length and width shall be given of each lot
sold or intended for sale. Such map or plat shall be subscribed by the
proprietor, or his agent duly authorized in writing, and acknowledged before an
officer authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds, who shall certify the
acknowledgment of the instrument.
SECTION 118. APPROVAL OF PLATS.
   The Council shall by ordinance provide regulations governing the platting of
all lands so as to require all streets to be of proper width, grade, and
location and to be coterminus with adjoining streets, and otherwise to conform
to the City plan. No plat subdividing lands within the corporate limits, or
within such distance thereof as may be provided from time to time by State law,
shall be entitled to be recorded in the recording office of the County without
the written approval of the City Planning Commission. Such approval shall be
given for any plat which shall conform to the regulations provided by Council.
Any land outside the corporate limits of the City belonging to the City shall
be deemed to be within such limits insofar as the application of the provisions
of this section are concerned.
SECTION 119. OFFICIAL MAP.
   The Council may by ordinance establish an official map or plan of the City
showing the streets, highways, boulevards, parks, playgrounds, and other public
places laid out or to be laid out, adopted, and established by law, and such
map or plan shall be deemed to be final and conclusive with respect to the
location and width of streets, highways, and boulevards, and the location of
parks, playgrounds, and other public places shown thereon. A certified copy of
the ordinance establishing such map or plan and of any ordinance making any
change therein or addition thereto, shall be promptly filed by the Clerk of
Council with the recorder of Scioto County.
SECTION 120. ZONING - BOARD OF APPEALS.
   The Council shall by ordinance provide regulations and restrictions
governing the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other
structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards,
courts, and other open spaces, and the location and use of buildings,
structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, and other purpose. Such
regulation shall provide for a Board of Appeals to determine and vary their
application in harmony with their general purpose and intent in accordance with
the general provisions of the ordinance.
   The Board of Appeals shall consist of five members, one of whom shall be the
President of Council. The other four members shall be citizens of the City of
Portsmouth, not in service of the City, who shall be appointed by Council to
serve without compensation for a term of one, two, three and four years, and
all subsequent terms to be for a four year period. The President of Council
shall be a voting member of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Adopted 11-5-68; Amended 11-5-02.)
SECTION 121. EFFECT OF PLATTING.
   From and after the date when this Charter takes effect no new streets or
alleys, except those laid down on a plat bearing the approval of the Planning
Commission and Council as hereinbefore provided, shall in any way be accepted
as public streets or alleys by the City, nor shall any public funds be expended
in the repair or improvement of streets and alleys subsequently laid out and
not on such a plat.
SECTION 122. ALTERATION OF STREETS.
   When it deems it necessary the Council may cause any street, alley, or
public highway to be opened, straightened, altered, diverted, narrowed,
widened, vacated, named or renamed.
SECTION 123. DEDICATION OF STREETS.
   No street or alley dedicated to public use by any proprietor of ground in
the City shall be deemed a public street or alley, or under the care or control
of the Council, unless the dedication shall have been accepted and confirmed by
ordinance passed for such purpose, or unless the provisions of Sections
117 and
118 hereof relating to subdivisions shall have been complied with.
SECTION 124. CREATION OR CHANGE OF NAME OF STREETS.
   The Council in vacating any street or part of street, or changing the name
of any street, may include in one ordinance the change of name or the vacation
or narrowing of more than one street, avenue, or alley, but before vacating any
street or part thereof, or narrowing any street, the Council shall first pass a
resolution declaring its intention so to do. The City Auditor shall cause
notice of such resolution to be served, in the manner that service of summons
is required to be made in civil actions, upon all persons whose property abuts
upon the portion of the street affected by the proposed vacation or narrowing,
and by publication once in one newspaper of general circulation in the City as
to all the persons who cannot be personally served. Said notice shall state the
time and place at which objections can be heard before the board of revision of
assessments. Upon the report of the board of revision of assessments approving
the proposed vacation or narrowing, the Council may by ordinance declare such
vacation or narrowing, and such order of the Council vacating or narrowing a
street or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the proprietor shall,
to the extent to which it is vacated or narrowed, operate as a revocation of
the acceptance thereof by the Council, but the right of way and easement
therein of any lot owner shall not be impaired thereby.
APPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY
SECTION 125. APPROPRIATION AUTHORIZED.
   Property within or without the corporate limits of the City may be
appropriated for any public or municipal purpose, and, subject only to the
limitations imposed by the constitution of the State, such appropriation shall
be made as herein provided. By such appropriation the City may acquire a fee
simple title or any less estate, easement or use. Appropriation shall be made
according to the requirements of, and as provided by, general law.
SECTION 126. DECLARATORY RESOLUTION.
   When it is deemed necessary to appropriate property the Council shall adopt
a resolution declaring such intent, defining the purpose of the appropriation,
setting forth a pertinent description of the property, and the estate or
interest therein desired to be appropriated.
SECTION 127. NOTICE TO OWNERS.
   Immediately upon the adoption of such resolution the City Auditor shall
cause written notice thereof to be given to the owner, person in possession
thereof, or having an interest of record in, every piece of land sought to be
appropriated, or to his authorized agent; and such notice shall be served by a
person designated for the purpose, and return made in the manner provided by
law for the service and return of summons in civil actions. If such owner,
person, or agent, cannot be found, notice shall be given by publication once a
week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City, and the Council may thereafter pass an ordinance directing such
appropriation to proceed.
SECTION 128. FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   Upon the passage of such ordinance the City Solicitor shall make application
to the Court of Common Pleas or to a judge thereof in vacation, or to the
Probate Court, which application shall describe as correctly as possible the
land or other property to be appropriated, the interest or estate therein to be
taken, the object for which the land is desired, and the name of the owner of
each lot or parcel thereof, and all the subsequent proceedings with regard
thereto shall be in the manner provided by general law for the appropriation of
property by municipal corporations in this State.
FRANCHISES AND PUBLIC UTILITIES
SECTION 129. FRANCHISE DEFINED.
   The term "franchise" as used in this Charter shall mean, a grant by the City
to any individual, company or corporation, for purpose of profit, of any
special privilege, except as specified in Section
131 hereof, in, over, upon or under any street, alley, public way, place or
grounds of the City whether such privilege has heretofore been, or may
hereafter be, granted; and no such special privilege may be claimed, nor shall
it be held or exercised, except under authority of a franchise from the City.
SECTION 130. GRANTS, AMENDMENTS AND RENEWALS OF FRANCHISES.
   No franchise shall be granted, amended or renewed except by ordinance. Any
such ordinance shall clearly specify the streets, alleys, public ways, places,
and grounds of the City, in, over, upon or under which the privilege is granted
and may prescribe the manner in which such streets, alleys, ways, places and
grounds shall be used and occupied and any other terms and conditions upon
which the franchise is to be exercised. The Council may, by ordinance, renew
any franchise at its expiration upon such terms as it may deem conducive to the
public interest.
SECTION 131. REVOCABLE PERMITS NOT FRANCHISES.
   Permits unconditionally revocable at the will of the Council for minor or
temporary privileges in the streets, alleys, public ways, places and grounds of
the City may be granted and revoked by ordinance, and such permits shall not be
deemed franchises as the term is used in this Charter.
SECTION 132. PASSAGE OF FRANCHISE ORDINANCES.
   No ordinance granting, amending or renewing a franchise shall be adopted by
the Council until a public written report containing recommendations thereon
shall have been made to the Council by, or under the direction of, the City
Manager; until adequate public hearings shall have been held on such ordinance
by the Council as a whole, or a committee thereof; and until at least one week
after its publication in final form in the manner required for the publication
of other ordinances following their passage. (Amended 11-8-11)
SECTION 133. PUBLIC UTILITY RATES; RESERVED RIGHTS OF CITY.
   The rates to be charged for the products or services of any public utility
as fixed in, or determined in the manner provided by, any franchise or
amendment or renewal thereof, shall be sufficient only to provide a reasonable
return upon the fair value of the property of such utility used, useful and
reasonably necessary in furnishing the product or service for the furnishing of
which the franchise, amendment or renewal is, or may have been, granted; and
whether it be so specified in the ordinance or not, all franchises, and all
amendments and renewals thereof, shall be subject to the right of the City:
   (a)   To repeal the same by ordinance for misuse, non-use or failure to
begin construction within the time prescribed, or otherwise to comply with the
terms prescribed;
   (b)   To require extensions of plant, equipment and service, and to
establish standards of service and quality of products, subject only to the
right to a reasonable return upon the fair value of the property as in this
section hereinbefore defined;
   (c)   To require the maintenance of plant, equipment and fixtures at the
highest practicable standard of efficiency;
   (d)   To examine and audit the accounts and other records of the utility at
any time;
   (e)   To terminate the franchise at any time and acquire by purchase,
condemnation, or otherwise, all property of the utility within the City or
elsewhere used in or useful for the operation of the utility within the City;
   (f)   To impose such other reasonable regulations as may be conducive to the
safety, welfare and accommodation of the public.
SECTION 134. VALUE OF GRANT EXCLUDED.
   No ordinance granting or renewing a public utility franchise shall be valid
unless it expressly provide that the price to be paid for the property of the
utility, in case of acquisition by the City, shall exclude all value of such
franchise or renewal; and in determining the fair value of the property of a
public utility, for the purpose of permitting a reasonable return thereon, no
allowance shall be made for the value of any franchise.
SECTION 135. EXTENSIONS.
   The Council may by amendment of an existing franchise ordinance grant to the
individual, company or corporation operating a public utility thereunder the
right to extend the appliances, fixtures and services of such utility in the
streets, alleys, public ways, places and grounds of the City. Any such
extension of a public utility shall become a part of the aggregate property
thereof, shall be operated as such, and shall be subject to all the obligations
and reserved rights in favor of the City contained in this Charter and in the
original franchise under which such utility is being operated. The right to use
and maintain any such extension shall terminate with the original franchise and
shall be terminable as provided in Section
133 of this Charter.
SECTION 136. CERTIFIED COPIES OF GRANTS, ETC.
   Within six months after this Charter takes effect every public utility, and
every owner of a public utility franchise, shall file with the City certified
copies of all such franchises owned or claimed, or under which any such utility
is operated within the City. Certified copies of all public utility franchises,
and of all amendments, renewals and extensions thereof, made subsequent to the
taking effect of this Charter shall be filed with the City by the grantee
within ten days after acceptance thereof. No franchise to construct or operate
a public utility shall be transferable except with the approval of the Council
expressed by ordinance; and certified copies of all transfers, mortgages and
other documents affecting the title or use of public utilities shall be filed
with the City within ten days after their execution. The certified copies of
franchises and other documents required by this section to be filed with the
City shall be filed and preserved as a public record in such office thereof as
the Council may by ordinance designate.
SECTION 137. NO EXCLUSIVE GRANT.
   No right to construct, maintain, or operate any public utility in the City
of Portsmouth and no renewal or extension thereof shall be exclusive. No
franchise granted shall be renewed earlier than two years prior to its
expiration unless the Council shall by an affirmative vote of at least all of
the members elected to Council less two first declared by ordinance its
intention of considering a renewal thereof. All extensions of a franchise
granted a public utility shall be subject, as far as practicable, to the terms
of the original franchise and shall expire therewith.
SECTION 138. CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS.
   No consent of any owner of property abutting on any street, alley, public
way, place or ground shall be required for the construction, maintenance or
operation of any public utility therein either under the original franchise or
any renewal thereof; but any owner of such property shall be entitled to
recover from the owner of a public utility the amount of actual damage to such
property occasioned by the utility, less any benefits accruing thereto from the
utility, provided that suit is commenced within one year after damage is begun.
SECTION 139. PUBLIC UTILITY FIXTURES AND APPLIANCES.
   The Council shall at all times control the distribution of space occupied by
public utility appliances and fixtures in, over, upon or under the streets,
alleys, public ways, places and grounds of the City; and all rights granted for

   All elections provided for by this Charter, whether for the nomination or
election of officers or the submission of questions to the voters, shall be

provisions of the general election laws of the State shall apply to all such
elections except as otherwise provided by this Charter. A regular municipal
election for the election of all elective officers provided for by this Charter
shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in odd
numbered years. Primary elections shall be held in the odd numbered years at
the time provided by the general election laws of the State for the purpose of
nominating persons as candidates for election to municipal offices to be voted
for at the next succeeding regular municipal election. Any matter which by the
terms of the Charter may be submitted to the electors of the City at any
special election may be submitted at a primary election or at a general
election.
(Adopted 11-4-52.)
SECTION 144. PETITIONS FOR PLACE ON PRIMARY ELECTION BALLOT.
   Candidates for all elective offices provided for by this Charter shall be
nominated only by a non-partisan primary election. The name of any qualified
elector shall be printed upon the primary ballot when there is filed with the
Board of Elections of Scioto County, Ohio, a petition in accordance with the
following provisions:
   (a)   Such petitions shall state the name and place of residence of each
person whose name is presented for a place upon the ballot, and the name of the
office which he seeks.
   (b)   Such petitions shall be signed by not less in number than fifty (50)
qualified electors of the municipal corporation if for the nomination of a
candidate for an office to be filled by election from the City at large, and by
not less than fifty (50) qualified electors of the ward, if for the nomination
of a candidate for an office to be filled by election from a ward.
   (c)   Such petition shall contain a provision that each elector signing a
petition shall add to his signature his place of residence, with street and
number, ward, voting precinct, date of signing, and may subscribe to no more
nominating petitions of candidates for said office then the number of
candidates to be nominated at such primary election. All signatures on such
petitions shall be written in ink or indelible lead pencil.
   (d)   The signatures on such petitions need not be appended to one paper,
but to each separate paper there shall be attached an affidavit of the
circulator thereof stating the number of signers thereto, that said signatures
were written in his presence on the date mentioned, and are the signatures of
the persons whose signatures they purport to be; and that he resides at the
address appearing below his signature hereon.
   (e)   Such petitions shall not be signed by any qualified elector more than
one hundred and five days prior to the day of such primary election, and any
such petitions bearing any signature placed thereon before that time shall be
rejected as entirely invalid.
   (f)   Signers of such nominating petitions shall insert therein the names
and addresses of five qualified electors of the respective City or ward in
which the candidate named in such petition is to be nominated, as a committee
which may fill vacancies caused by death or withdrawal.
   (g)   Before such nominating petitions are filed as herein provided, the
nominee named therein shall subscribe his acceptance of such nomination
thereon, and also declare thereon that if nominated and elected he will qualify
for the office which he seeks. In the absence of such acceptance the nominee's
name shall not be printed on the ballot.
   (h)   All separate papers comprising a nominating petition of a candidate
shall be assembled and filed at the same time as one instrument with the Board
of Elections of Scioto County, Ohio, not later than the date and time
established by the general election laws of the State of Ohio, in odd numbered
years. At the time of filing a nominating petition for an office as herein
provided, the candidate designated therein shall pay to the election officials
with whom it is filed a fee of one-half of one percent of the annual salary of
such office, not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00). Candidates whose names are
written on the ballot, as provided by the general election laws, and who are
nominated, shall pay the same fee as candidates who file their nominating
petitions. Payment of this fee by such candidates shall be deemed a condition
precedent to granting their certificates of nomination. All such fees shall
forthwith be paid by the official receiving them into the Treasury of the
County to the credit of the General Fund of the County; and in no case shall
the filing fee be returned to a candidate.
   (i)   Only persons who are qualified electors (registered voters) residing
in the City, may circulate a nominating petition for any office to be filled by
election from the city at large, and only persons who are qualified electors
(registered voters) residing in the ward, may circulate a nominating petition
for any office to be filled by election from the ward. The circulator is
required to sign a statement, under oath, made under penalty of election
falsification, that he witnessed the affixing of every signature, that all
signers were to the best of his knowledge and belief qualified to sign, and
that every signature is the unassisted signature of the person whose signature
it purports to be. Further, if a circulator knowingly permits an unqualified
person to sign a petition paper or permits a person to write a name other than
his own on a petition paper, that petition paper is invalid; otherwise, the
signature of a person not qualified to sign shall be rejected, but shall not
invalidate the other valid signatures on the paper.
      (Amended 11-5-74; 5-7-02; 11-4-03; 11-5-13.)
SECTION 145. BALLOTS.
   The names of all candidates for the nomination and election to the elective
offices provided for by this Charter whose petitions have been duly filed or
whose nomination has been duly made and not withdrawn, shall be placed on one
independent and separate ballot without any designation whatever, except the
office to which said candidates are to be nominated or elected, and the number
of candidates required to be nominated or elected to such office, and such
certification of the election officials upon the back of the ballot as is
prescribed by law.
(Adopted 11-4-52.)
SECTION 146. ROTATION OF NAMES.
   In all elections the names of candidates on all ballots for the nomination
or election to the elective offices provided for by this Charter, shall be
printed and rotated in such order on the ballots in accordance with the Ohio
Revised Code. (Amended 5-7-02)
   The method of printing and combining the ballots in tablets to meet the
rotation requirements herein shall be as follows: The total number of ballots
upon which the names of all the candidates to be printed thereon are the same,
shall be printed in as many series as the number of candidates in the largest
group of candidates seeking the same nomination or election. Such total number
of ballots to be printed divided by the number of series to be printed shall
determine the number of ballots to be printed in each series. On the first
series of ballots the names of the candidates in each group of candidates for
the same office shall be in alphabetical order of their surnames under the
title thereof. On each succeeding series the name of the candidate in each
group of candidates for the same office which was first in the preceding series
shall be last, and the names of each of the other candidates in each group for
the same office shall be moved up one place. The printed ballots shall then be
combined in tablets by assembling series of ballots, each consisting of one
ballot of each series printed as above described, assembled in the same
consecutive order in which the series, of which each ballot is a part, was
printed, and by combining as many of such assembled series of ballots as may be
necessary to make tablets consisting of the number of ballots required for each
precinct.
   A blank space shall be provided on all ballots below the printed names of
the candidates for each office to be voted for, wherein an elector may write in
the name of a person for whom he desires to vote for the nomination or election
to the office designated on the ballot, and votes cast for such person shall be
counted in the same manner as votes cast for candidates whose names are printed
on the ballots. (Adopted 11-4-52; 5-7-02.)
SECTION 147. SPECIAL ELECTION OFFICIALS.
   Notwithstanding any of the provisions of the General Code of Ohio, the board
of elections may, by the adoption of a resolution, provide that any primary
election for the nomination of candidates for a municipal office in said City
and at any special election at which the number of questions and issues voted
upon by the electors of said City does not exceed ten (10), the precinct
officials at any such election shall be two (2) judges and two (2) clerks, who
shall perform all duties prescribed by law for the proper conduct of an
election by precinct officials. Such precinct officials shall be well qualified
for the performance of their duties and said precinct officials for any special
election may or may not be selected from among those regularly appointed under
the general election laws of the State; provided, however, that not more than
one of the judges and not more than one of the clerks shall be members of the
same political party. The term of such especially appointed precinct officials
shall be fixed by the Board of Elections, but they are subject to removal at
any time by the Board. Each such precinct official shall be paid compensation
for his services to be fixed by the Board of Elections. (Adopted 11-4-52.)
SECTION 147-a. PRIMARY ELECTIONS.
   If the number of persons filing "Petitions For Candidates" for nomination as
candidates at a primary election to such office does not exceed, as to any such
office, the number of candidates which may be nominated under provisions of the
Charter, then no primary election shall be held for the purpose of nominating
candidates for election to offices to be voted for at such general election and
no primary ballot shall be printed for said office.
   If the number of persons filing “Petitions for Candidates” for nomination as
candidates at a primary election to such office does exceed, as to any such
office, the number of candidates which may be nominated under provisions of the
Charter, then a primary election shall be held for the purpose of nominating
two candidates for election to offices to be voted for at such general election
and a primary ballot shall be printed for said office containing language,
“Vote for not more than 1".
   If, however, the only offices for which there are more valid petitions for
candidates filed than the number to be nominated under provisions of the
Charter, is the office of councilman in a ward, a primary election shall be
held for such office in the ward or wards in which there is a contest, and only
the names of the candidates for the office of councilman in such ward shall
appear on the primary ballot.
   The election officials whose duty it would have been to provide for and
conduct the holding of such primary election, declare the results thereof, and
issue certificates of nomination to the persons entitled thereto if such
primary election had been held shall declare each of such persons to be
nominated as of the date of the ninetieth day before the primary election,
issue appropriate certificates of nomination to each of them and certify their
names to the proper election officials, in order that their names may be
printed on the official ballots provided for use in the next succeeding general
election in the same manner as though such primary election had been held and
such persons had been nominated at such election.
   This section shall take effect and be in force as of the date of the
certification to the Secretary of State by the Board of Elections.
(Amended 3-15-16.)
SECTION 148. REGULAR MUNICIPAL ELECTION.
   The name of the candidate for nomination who receives the greatest number of
votes for the elective offices provided for by this Charter in the primary
election herein provided for, shall be printed on the ballot under the proper
designation of such office at the next regular municipal election. In addition,
the name of the candidate, if any, for nomination who receives the next highest
number of votes for such respective offices in such primary election, shall
also be printed on the ballot at such regular municipal election. The candidate
who receives the highest number of votes at the regular municipal election for
such elective offices shall be declared elected to such offices. The candidate
who receives the highest number of votes at such municipal election in each of
the wards of said City for the office of member of City Council shall be
declared elected to the office of member of City Council from such ward. If
more than the number of candidates to be elected to said offices receive the
largest and an equal number of votes, such tie shall be resolved by lot by the
Board of Elections of Scioto County, Ohio, as provided by the general election
laws of Ohio.
(Adopted 11-4-52.)
SECTION 149. CHALLENGERS AND WITNESSES.
   Any three or more candidates may appoint in writing one challenger and one
witness, who shall be electors of the City, to represent them at each voting
place. All such appointments must be filed with the Board of Elections not more
than ten (10) days or less than five (5) days prior to the time fixed for
opening the polls of any election. Certificates evidencing the appointment of
such challenger and witness shall be issued to each of them by the Board of
Elections at least two (2) days prior to the day of election. Any such
challenger or witness shall have the right to present within the voting place,
in addition to the persons authorized to be there by State law, the challenger
from the time of opening to the closing of the polls and the witness from one
hour before the polls close until the precinct officials have completed the
count and sent the ballots to the Board of Elections and shall have the rights
and privileges assigned by statute to challengers, witnesses and inspectors at
any elections held within the City. A person serving as challenger is eligible
as a witness. No candidate shall share in the appointment of more than one
challenger and witness for each voting place. Any precinct judge who refuses to
admit to the polling place any challenger or witness who presents the
certificate above mentioned or any challenger or inspector who knowingly
presents a false certificate to such judge of election shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and be subject to the same fine and penalty as provided in the
general election laws of the State.

presenting names of candidates for nomination at a primary election, and
similar in form to such petitions, but signed by qualified electors equal in
number to that provided for an original primary nomination for such office, and
filed with the Board of Elections of the County at least sixty (60) days prior
to such recall election. But no such nominating petition shall be signed or
circulated until after the time has expired for signing the petition for the
recall, and any signatures thereon antedating such time shall not be counted.

candidates shall be printed on the ballots in rotation as provided for a

   If a majority of the votes cast on the question of recalling an elective
officer shall be against his recall he shall continue in office for the
remainder of his unexpired term, but subject to recall as before. If a majority
of the votes cast on such question shall be in favor of the removal of such
officer he shall, regardless of any defect in the recall petition, be deemed
removed from office upon the certification of the official canvass of the
election by the Board of Elections of the County to the City Clerk, and the
vacancy in the office caused by such recall shall be filled as provided in this
Charter for filling a vacancy in the office from which such officer has been
removed. When a member of the Council is removed from office by recall the

municipal election, shall succeed the member so removed for the unexpired term
of office.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

expressly made retrospective.

of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the

such other information as may be required by the Board. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its

   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the
Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall

   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under

   (e)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds under which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the Board
immediately, and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen (15) days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The
summons so issued must be signed by two (2) members of the Board and the
issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties
may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized
representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such costs as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the City Solicitor in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Solicitor to prepare and
issue an order under Council directive requiring the person complained against
to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative
action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice that if the
Board determines that the person complained against has not after fifteen (15)
calendar days following service of the Board's order, complied with the order,
the Board will recertify the matter to the City Solicitor for enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the City Solicitor for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such
proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation of this
chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

175.04 APPLICABILITY.
   This chapter provides full power and authority over all trees, plants and
shrubs located within street rights-of-way, parks and public places of the
City; and to trees, plants and shrubs located on private property that
constitute a hazard or threat as described herein.
(Ord. 1-1998. Passed 1-12-98.)
175.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Wherever the following words or terms are used in this chapter, they shall
be construed to have the following meanings:
   (a)   “Person” means person, firm, association, or corporation.
   (b)    “City” means the City of Portsmouth, Ohio.
   (c)    “Public areas” includes all public parks and other lands owned,
controlled, or leased by the City, to include the rights of way.
   (d)    “Public trees and shrubs” means all trees and shrubs located or to be
located in or upon public areas and or rights of way.
   (e)    “Public nuisance” means any tree or shrub or part thereof which by
reason of its condition interferes with the use of any public area; is infected
with a plant disease; is infested with injurious insects or pests; is injurious
to public improvements or endangers the life, health, safety or welfare of
persons or property.
   (f)    “Boulevard areas” means land between the normal location of the
street curbing and sidewalk. Where there is no sidewalk, the area four feet
from the curbline shall be deemed to be a boulevard for the purpose of this
chapter. Boulevard areas also refer to the center boulevard on center island
streets.
   (g)    “Clear sight triangle” means a triangle formed by the curb lines of
two intersecting rights of way and a third line connecting a full view zone 20
feet from intersecting corners of the street. On streets with no curb and

is stressful to mature trees and may result in reduced vigor, decline or even

require constant maintenance to prevent this from happening, and it is often
impossible to restore the structure of the tree crown after topping.

list of desirable trees for public tree planting in three size classes: small,

   (g)    Pruning, Corner Clearance. Every owner of any tree overhanging any
street right of way within the City shall prune the branches so that such

of any street intersection and so that there shall be a clear space of eight
feet vertically above the surface of the sidewalk. Said owners shall remove all
dead, diseased or dangerous trees, or broken or decaying limbs that constitute
a menace to the safety of the public. The City shall have the right to prune
any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with visibility of any
traffic control device or sign, if the property owner fails to adequately

behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         (b)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services that can
reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days" if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
            (i)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

181.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
    (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section

and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If

and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.

return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such

      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose

deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award

the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

181.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
181.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
181.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
181.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts

amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or

and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is

         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section

owed to the City of Portsmouth, Ohio.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City of Portsmouth, Ohio,
who receives net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal
service compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of

municipal income tax on the same income taxable under this chapter to another
municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf to such other municipality(s) up
to fifty-percent (50%) of the amount owed to the City of Portsmouth, Ohio. The
credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned
in such other municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid
   (C)   Notwithstanding the provisions contained in Section

municipalities.

that a resident, working in another municipality imposing a tax on earned
income shall not be required to file a declaration under Section
181.07 or return under Section

181.01 is being deducted from the wages of such resident and is being paid to
such other municipality and if the wages or other compensation subject to such
withholding are the resident's only income taxable under this chapter.

181.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.

tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced

181.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

181.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

181.062 of this Chapter;
   (G)    Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, assessments and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,
determination, computation, assessment or order which the Tax Administrator has
made for which an appeal has been filed with the Local Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
      (Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
    (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members, who
may, but are not required to, reside within the Municipality. Two members shall
be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Municipality at any time
during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official
of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but
may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
181.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Policy Committee, consisting
of the City Solicitor, City Auditor and City Manager, to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.

any kind within the Municipality, all owners of rental property who rent to

if available, of each such tenant who occupies an apartment, room or other
rental property within the Municipality.
   (2)   Within ninety (90) days after a tenant vacates an apartment, room or
other rental property located within the Municipality, the owner of such
vacated rental property shall file with the Tax Administrator a report showing
the date of vacation from the rental property and a forwarding address.

181.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)
181.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-90. Passed 12-14-15.)

183.02 LEVY OF TAX; WHEN COLLECTABLE; EXEMPTIONS; PRESUMPTION.
   (a)    An excise tax is hereby levied and imposed upon each transaction in
Portsmouth, Ohio, by which lodging is or is to be furnished by a vendor to a
transient guest or guests, at the rate of four percent (4%) of the rent for
each such transaction, on and after June 1, 1999.
(Ord. 1999-49. Passed 5-10-99.)
   (b) The tax applies and is collectable when the lodging is furnished,
regardless of the time when the rent is paid or delivered.
   (c)   The tax does not apply to any rent which is paid or to be paid or
reimbursed by the Federal government, the State of Ohio, or any of its
political subdivisions.
   
   (d)   For the purpose of the proper administration, and to prevent evasion,
of the tax, it is presumed that all rents for motel hotel rooms, short-term
rentals and bed & breakfasts in the City are subject to the tax until the
contrary is established.
   (e)    The tax is not a part of the rent and shall be separately stated as
such on every rent invoice, bill, statement or other written charge therefor.
(Ord. 2022-114. Passed 12-12-22.)
 
183.03 LIABILITIES OF VENDOR AND CONSUMER; CERTIFICATE FOR EXEMPTION.
   (a)    The tax is imposed upon and shall be paid by the consumer to the
vendor as trustee solely for the benefit of Portsmouth, Ohio, and each vendor
as such trustee shall collect from the consumer the full and exact amount of
the tax payable on each taxable transaction in the manner and at the times
provided as follows:
      (1)    If the price is, at or prior to the transaction, paid in cash,
check, draft or money order by the consumer to the vendor, the vendor shall
collect the tax with and at the same time as the price.
      (2)    If the price is otherwise paid or to be paid, the vendor shall, at
or prior to the furnishing of lodgings, charge the tax to the account of the
consumer, which amount shall be collected by the vendor from the consumer in
addition to the price.
   (b)   Each such transaction shall be reported on, and the amount of the tax
applicable thereto shall be remitted with, the return for the period in which
the transaction occurs and the amount of the tax shall become a legal charge in
favor of the vendor and against the consumer.
   (c)    To the extent the vendor fails to collect the tax from the consumer
upon each taxable transaction or, having collected the tax, fails to return and
remit the same when due, the tax is hereby imposed and levied upon the vendor.
This paragraph does not affect any duty of a vendor nor the liability of any
consumer to pay the tax, both as imposed upon each hereunder; but any payment
of tax by the vendor or the consumer reduces the liability of the other to the
City to the extent of the payment.
   (d)   If any transaction is claimed to be exempt from the tax, the consumer
must furnish to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the consumer, a
certificate specifying the reason that the transaction is not legally subject
to the tax. If no certificate is furnished or obtained within the period for
filing the return for the period in which such transaction is reportable, it
shall be presumed that the tax applies. The failure to have so furnished, or to
have so obtained a certificate shall not prevent a vendor or consumer from
establishing that the transaction is not subject to the tax within sixty (60)
days of the giving of notice by the Auditor of his intention to levy an
assessment, in which event the tax shall not apply. Certificates need not be
obtained nor furnished where the identity of the consumer is such that the
transaction is never subject to the tax imposed. The certificate shall be in
the following form:
STATE OF OHIO
CITY OF PORTSMOUTH, OHIO

183.04 RETURNS; REMISSION OF PENALTIES; FAILURE TO FILE; FORM.
   (a)    Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of 1980, and on or
before the last day of each month following the end of each calendar quarter
thereafter, make and file a full and complete return in quadruplicate with the
Auditor for the preceding calendar quarter on the form prescribed and set forth
by the Auditor, showing all the information required thereon, including the
amount of tax required to be collected from the consumer and the amount of tax
due from the vendor to the City. (Ord. 2003-70. Passed 7-14-03.)
   (b)    Upon application of the vendor, in writing and for good cause shown,
the Auditor may extend the time for making and filing returns and may remit any

the Administrator, together with the payment of the amount of tax shown to be

otherwise mark on all copies the date received and the amount of payment
received.
   (e)    Any vendor who fails to file a complete return as required hereby
shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the City Treasury the sum
of one dollar ($1.00) as revenue arising from the tax, and such may be
collected by assessment in the manner provided herein.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99; Ord. 2003-70. Passed 7-14-03.)
183.05 ASSESSMENTS; LIABILITIES OF VENDOR AND CONSUMER.
   (a)   If any vendor collects the tax and fails to remit the same to the City
as provided herein he shall be personally liable for any amount collected which
he failed to remit; or if any vendor fails to collect the tax or any consumer
fails to pay the tax on any transaction subject thereto, such vendor or
consumer shall be personally liable for the same, and the Auditor may make an
assessment against the vendor in the first case, or the vendor or consumer in
the second case, as the facts may require, based upon any information in his
possession.
   (b)   An assessment against a vendor shall not discharge the consumer's
liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax if the latter has not paid the
tax.
   (c)   An assessment issued against either the vendor or the consumer shall
not be considered an election of remedies nor a bar to an assessment against
the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction; provided, that no
assessment shall be issued against any person for the tax due on a particular
transaction if the tax has been paid by another.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.06 MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS; ASSESSMENTS.
   (a)   The burden of proof rests upon each vendor to show what part, if any,
of his gross receipts from motel/hotel room rents is not taxable, and for such
purpose each vendor shall maintain and keep complete and accurate records of
rents, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall
include:
      (1)    Primary records such as all guest or rent registers, rent
invoices, statements or bills, rent payments and/or refunds thereon, room rate
sheets or card of prices per day of each room as required by Ohio R.C. 3731.16,
receipts of taxes collected, copies of the appropriate schedule of Federal
income tax returns, Ohio sales tax returns and tax returns to local
subdivisions having a motel/hotel lodging excise tax identical or substantially
similar to the tax imposed hereby, as filed by the vendor, exemption
certificates, tax payment receipts, cash register tapes and all other pertinent
documents; and
      (2)    Secondary records such as bank deposit receipts and day books,
journals, or any other records in which there is accumulated data by the
vendor, which must be supported by complete detailed records from which such
data was accumulated.
   (b)   Guest or rent invoices, statements or bills and cash register tapes
for taxable rents must have the total taxable rent and the tax charged and/or
collected separately stated thereon, which amounts are to be accumulated and
recorded in a secondary record.
   (c)    Rent invoices, statements or bills must also clearly show the length
of stay, in terms of consecutive days, for each guest.
   (d)   All such records must be preserved for a period of four (4) years
unless the Auditor consents, in writing, to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept for a longer period; provided,
however, that any such records need no longer be preserved after an assessment
for additional tax has been made and paid, with all penalties and interest
thereon, for the period involved in such assessment, but a copy of such paid
assessment shall be maintained for four (4) years following the period included
in such assessment.
   (e)   All such records and documents shall be open during regular business
hours to inspection of the Auditor who shall review, investigate, examine and
audit any of such records of any vendor from time to time to determine if the
proper tax has been returned and remitted. In connection with such
investigation, he may interview the vendor, his agents and employees and take
written statements therefrom under oath pursuant to the power conferred upon
him and the Council by law. If his investigation of such complete records
reveals that any tax or additional tax should properly have been returned and
remitted by the vendor, he shall make an assessment of such tax or additional
tax in the manner provided in paragraph (g) thereof, infra, provided that if
the Auditor is satisfied that the failure to return said tax or additional tax
when due was caused by unintentional or immaterial error, mistake or omission,
he shall not impose the penalty.
   (f)   If any vendor fails to maintain complete primary sales records,
accurately reflecting the total rents subject to the tax and of the tax due
thereon, or which may be utilized in verifying the accuracy of the figures
reflected in his secondary records and/or reported on his tax returns filed
hereunder, the Auditor will use one of the following methods for such
verification:
      (1)    Determine the total amount of all rents, less rental refunds when
the full tax has also been refunded either in cash or by credit, as the facts
may require, based upon any information in his possession.
      (2)    Determine taxable and non-taxable rents, or the ratio of taxable
rents to total rents, or both, as the facts may require, based upon any
information in his possession.
   The above described determinations may be based upon a sampling or test
checks of the vendor's business activity for a representative period, or other
information relating to the rental of rooms made by such vendor. The Auditor
may make the same determination where the facts in his possession reasonably
lead him to believe that the amount of tax required to be collected is or
should be greater than the amount remitted by the vendor.
   (g)   If any vendor:
      (1)    Fails to maintain complete records, as required hereby; or
      (2)    Fails or refuses to permit the Auditor to inspect any records; or
      (3)    Refuses to permit the Auditor to sample or test check his business
activity; or
      (4)    Having filed a return or returns, misrepresents or fails to
disclose, any material fact or figure thereon; or
      (5)    Having collected the tax, fails to remit the same when due; or
      (6)    Fails to remit the correct amount of tax or interest thereon when
due; or
       (7)    Fails to file a full and complete return when due; the Auditor
shall determine the proper amount of tax by any of the means set forth
hereinabove; the tax as so determined will be deemed to be the tax collected by
such vendor during the entire period of time under review; and the Auditor
shall make an assessment of such amount of tax based upon such determination,
less the tax paid during such period, if any,
         A.   Plus interest thereon at the rate of six (6%) percent per annum,
computed from the time the amounts of tax assessed should have been paid;
         B.   Plus a penalty of fifteen (15%) percent of the amount of the
assessment of tax.
   (h)   No assessment, however, shall be made or issued against a vendor or
consumer for any tax more than four (4) years after the return day for the
period in which the taxable transaction giving rise to the assessment of the
tax occurred, or after the return for said period was filed, whichever is
later.
   (i)   All returns, documents and payments submitted by each vendor, all
records and other documents examined and all information or knowledge of any
vendor’s business obtained by the Auditor, shall be treated as confidential by
the Auditor and the Council and shall not be released by them except upon order
of a court of competent jurisdiction or to a duly authorized officer or agent
of the Federal government, the State of Ohio or any municipal corporation or
township in Scioto County which levies a tax pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5739.024(B).
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.07 PROCEDURE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT; APPEALS.
   (a)   Each assessment shall be in writing stating clearly the reasons and
basis therefor, upon forms adopted by the Auditor.
   (b)   In each case of an assessment, the Auditor shall give to the assessee
written notice thereof to be served personally or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, along with a copy of the written assessment.
   (c)   Unless the assessee, within thirty (30) days after service thereof,
files with the Auditor a petition for reassessment in writing addressed to the
Council and verified under oath by the assessee or his duly authorized agent
having knowledge of the facts, and setting forth with particularity the items
of assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objection, the
assessment shall become final and the amount thereof shall be deemed a debt due
and payable to the City, whereupon the Auditor shall cause to be filed a civil
action in the name of the City for judgment in the amount of the assessment,
including penalties and interest added thereto under the provisions hereof.
   (d)   When a petition for reassessment is timely filed, the Board shall
assign a time and place for hearing the same and shall notify the petitioner
thereof by certified mail. Notice of the decision of the Board upon the
petition after hearing shall be served upon the petitioner by certified mail
and deposited in the United States mail on the date of the entry of the
decision in its journal.
   (e)   If aggrieved by the decision of the Board, the petitioner may appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.56.
   (f)   When the merits of the assessment or any part thereof is finally
adjudicated, the Auditor shall proceed to collect the same as in paragraph (c)
hereof upon the failure of a petition for reassessment.
   (g)   All monies collected upon assessments including penalties and interest
thereon shall, when received by the City, be considered as revenue arising from
the tax.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.08 LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND AGENTS.
   If any person, other than an individual, required to file returns and to
remit the tax, fails for any reason to make such filing or payment, its
officers, partners or managing agents, or employees having control or
supervision of, or charged with the responsibility of, filing returns and
making payments of tax, shall be personally liable for such failure. The
dissolution of such entity shall not discharge its liability for a failure to
file returns or remit tax due prior to such dissolution. Such liability may be
collected by assessment in the manner provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.09 SALE OF ENTIRE BUSINESS; SUCCESSOR LIABLE FOR TAXES AND PENALTIES DUE.
   If a vendor liable for the tax sells his business or quits his business, the
taxes, interest and penalties imposed hereby on taxable rents made prior to
that time shall become due and payable immediately, and such person shall make
a final return within fifteen (15) days after the date of selling or quitting
business. His successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase
money to cover the amount of such taxes, interest, and penalties due and unpaid
until the former owner produces a receipt from the Auditor showing that the
taxes, interest, and penalties have been paid, or a certificate indicating that
no taxes are due. If the purchaser of the business fails to withhold purchase
money, he shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest,
and penalties accrued and unpaid during the operation of the business by the
former owner.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.10 REFUND OF TAXES ILLEGALLY OR ERRONEOUSLY PAID.
   A written claim for refund of taxes illegally or erroneously paid (or paid
on an illegal or erroneous assessment where the vendor has not reimbursed
himself from the consumer) may be filed in writing with the Auditor by a vendor
within ninety (90) days from the date the claimant ascertains that the payment
was illegal or erroneous, but not later than four (4) years from the date of
such payment.
   Such claim must show that the tax was remitted to the City and that if it
was collected from a consumer, the claimant has either reimbursed himself from
the consumer or will hold such refund in trust for the benefit of the consumer.
   The Auditor shall promptly determine the amount of the refund due, and
whether an unpaid liability for tax against the claimant for the payment of tax
currently exists, in which case, such refund, if allowed, plus interest, or to
the extent allowed, shall be applied against such current liability to the full
extent of the latter. The Auditor shall certify the excess amount of refund
allowed or the full amount, as the case may be, to the City Auditor who shall
draw his warrant for such certified amount in favor of the claimant. The City
Auditor shall pay such amount from any monies to the credit of the Motel/Hotel
Excise Tax Account of the City of Portsmouth's General Revenue Fund.
   If, however, the Auditor's decision on a claim for refund is to award less
than the full amount claimed, his decision shall be treated in the same manner
as an assessment under Section
183.07 and the aggrieved claimant and the City shall have all the rights,
remedies and duties as set forth in Section
183.07 as upon an assessment; but the Auditor shall withhold his certification
until the merits of the claim have been finally adjudicated.
(Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.11 EXAMPLES.
   The following examples are published to illustrate, for the benefit of the
public, the application of the tax in the specific situations:
   (a)   If a person engages or reserves and pays for, motel/hotel room(s) for
thirty (30) consecutive days or more for specified guest(s), the tax does not
apply notwithstanding that such guest(s) may, in fact, occupy the room(s) for
less than thirty (30) consecutive days.
   (b)   If in example (a) the room(s) are vacated in less than thirty (30)
days, the tax applies.
   (c)   If a person engages or reserves motel/hotel room(s) for less than
thirty (30) days for specified guest(s) and during or at the end of the
engagement or reservation period extends the engagement of room(s), whether the
same or different room(s), for thirty (30) days or more, without interruption
of occupancy or the right to occupancy, the tax does not apply.
   (d)   If a person engages or reserves motel/hotel room(s) for more than
thirty (30) days for guest(s) who may not, in fact, have the right to occupy
the room(s) for thirty (30) or more consecutive days, the tax applies.
   (e)   If a guest occupies one room for less than thirty (30) days both for
lodging and business purposes, the tax applies.
   (f)   If, in example (e), such a guest occupies a suite of, or two (2) or
more connecting rooms, the tax applies to the suite or all of the connecting
rooms unless each connecting room, or separate room comprising the suite, is
regularly assigned a rate for lodging and rented for separate lodging, in which
case the tax applies only to the rent for the rooms so occupied for lodging,
not to those occupied for other purposes.
   (g)   If lodging is provided without any compensation therefor and for
whatever reason, and without any compensating change whatsoever in the regular
rates of all other lodgings in the motel/hotel, the tax does not apply to such
complimentary lodging.
   (h)   Vouchers contained in voucher books, thrift books and coupon books,
which entitle the purchaser of the books to trade at different retail
establishments shall be treated as money when applied to pay for lodging and
the tax shall attach to all rents paid by the use of such vouchers, using as a
tax basis the money value of the coupon or voucher.
    (i)   If lodgings are rented one (1) or more times in any twenty-hour
period to different guest(s) or consumer(s), the tax applies to each rental.
      (Ord. 1999-27. Passed 3-22-99.)
183.12 DISTRIBUTION OF TAX.
   (a)   After deducting the real and actual costs of administering the tax,
sixty-six and two- thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the revenue arising from the
original 3% of the tax and one hundred percent (100%) of the revenue arising

its designee. Additionally, valid hearing requests must include payment in the
amount of $50.00, which shall serve as a bond for the hearing. An individual
desiring a hearing must post this $50.00 bond before a hearing will be
scheduled. The failure to give notice of request for hearing with bond within
this time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest towing,
impoundment, and/or immobilization. A hearing, conducted by a hearing officer,
shall be held within ten business days of the city's receipt of the request for
review unless the City of Portsmouth shows good cause for delay. The Police
Chief or its designee will send written notice of the date, time, and place of

evidence establishes that a vehicle was properly towed, impounded, and/or
immobilized pursuant to the law. Copies of the notice of violations or
citations and a signed statement from the City Auditor or designee shall be
admissible and establish prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein
and also create a rebuttable presumption that the towing, impoundment, or

timely requested a hearing and prevailed at that hearing on the underlying
notices of violation or citations, the owner has waived his or her right to
contest the underlying notices of liability or citations at this hearing.

finds that the tow, impoundment, or immobilization was proper and in accordance
with the law, the Hearing Officer shall uphold the tow, impoundment, and/or
immobilization and condition the release of the vehicle upon payment of all
fines and fees accruing thereto. If bond has been posted, said bond shall be
forfeited to the City of Portsmouth. Any fines or fees shall be ordered to be
paid by the owner of the vehicle to the City of Portsmouth. Where the Hearing
Officer finds that the tow, impoundment or immobilization was not proper and in
accordance with the law, an order releasing the vehicle shall be entered, the
bond shall be returned to the owner, and the owner shall not be liable for the
tow or storage fees. The City of Portsmouth or its designee shall mail the
owner a copy of the Hearing Officer's order within ten days from the date of
the hearing.
         C.   All hearings are open to the public.
         D.   Storage fees for towed, impounded, or immobilized vehicles shall
continue to accrue during the pendency of the appeal.

subject to court review. Unless prohibited by law, the City of Portsmouth may
seek judicial review of decisions by the Hearing Officer.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.

offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency

is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasmabreath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
subsection (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
subsection (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates subsection (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become        inadmissible because
of his complicity, moral turpitude       or self-interest, but the admitted or
claimed complicity       of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that       it be
weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.)

Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

securely enclosed and locked pen or kennel, or in a fenced in yard with a
locked gate. Such fenced in yard must be equipped with a six (6) foot high
fence, or that of adequate height determined by the Portsmouth City Animal
Control Officer. The fence must be equipped with a locked gate. If said fence
is not sufficient in height or strength to keep vicious dogs from running at

attached to its sides.

control of the animal at all times. Such dogs may not be leashed to inanimate
objects such as trees, posts, buildings, etc.
      (4)   While not being classified as vicious, due to the disproportionate
number of documented “pit bulls” running at large complaints and documented
attacks on domestic animals and people, all dogs that meet the definition of
“pit bulls”, as stated in subsection (e), must be confined as stated in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (d)   Insurance Identification and Reporting Requirements.

thousand dollars ($100,000).
         A.   The owner, keeper or harborer of a “Pit Bull Dog”, as defined in

enforcement officer, animal control officer, or public health official must
provide proof of the required liability insurance.

Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, American
Staffordshire Terrier, and other breed commonly known as Pit Bulls, Pit Bull
Dogs, or Pit Bull Terriers, or a combination of any of these breeds. The

beekeeping within the City, to avoid issues which might otherwise be associated
with beekeeping in populated areas.

configuration of the apiary tract:

200 feet from any hive, measured from any point on the hives, remain
undeveloped, there shall be no limit to the number of colonies. No
grandfathering rights shall accrue under this subsection.
   No hives are permitted on any tract where the setback requirements cannot be
satisfied regardless of tract size.

each instance where a colony is kept less than twenty-five (25) feet from a
property line of the lot upon which the apiary is located, as measured from the

and maintain a flyway barrier at least six (6) feet in height.
   The flyway barrier may consist of a wall, fence, dense vegetation or a
combination there of such that bees will fly over rather than through the
material to reach the colony between the hives and the adjacent lots. If a
flyway barrier of dense vegetation is used, the initial planting may be 4 feet
in height, so long as the vegetation normally reaches six (6) feet in height or
higher. The flyway barrier must continue parallel to the apiary lot line for
ten (10) feet in either direction from the hive, or contain the hive or hives
in an enclosure at least six (6) feet in height.
   Alternately, locating the hive eight (8) feet or more above the ground shall
also be considered a suitable barrier. Such location must be at least twenty
(20) feet from any windows, doors or sidewalks on the adjacent property.

line (1) is undeveloped, or (2) is zoned agricultural, industrial or is outside
of the City limits, or (3) is a wildlife management area or naturalistic park
land with no horse or foot trails located within twenty-five (25) feet of the
apiary lot line.
   (d)   Exemption. The beekeeper may be exempt from the setback to adjacent
lot lines and requirements for a flyway barrier by obtaining written permission
from the adjacent lot owner(s). The setback to public sidewalks and roadways
may not be waived.

swarms of honey bees from locations where they are not desired, the beekeeper
shall not be considered in violation the portion of this ordinance limiting the
number of colonies if he temporarily houses the swarm on the apiary lot in

is located, at least seven (7) days before the hearing.
   (b)   The hearing shall be conducted by the Code Enforcement Officer. The
burden shall be on the City to demonstrate by a preponderance of evidence that
the colony or colonies have been kept in violation of this ordinance. If the
Code Enforcement Officer finds a violation, then he/she may order that the bees
be removed from the City or such other action as may address the violation, and
that the apiary lot be disqualified for permitting under this ordinance for a
period of two (2) years from the date of the order, the apiary lot ownership

paragraph, or subsection of this chapter is unconstitutional as worded, the
Court shall first attempt to construe or interpret such unconstitutional
provision so as to enable the same to be constitutional as so narrowed or
construed. If the Court cannot so limit or construe such word or provision
narrowly so as to render the same constitutional, it shall strike or modify
only the minimum number of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or paragraphs as
will be absolutely necessary to render the remainder constitutional. In no case
shall a clause or phrase or word or other portion hereof render any other word,
clause, phrase, sentence, paragraph or section unconstitutional, but instead
shall be severed therefrom entirely, with the balance of this chapter in its
entirety remaining in full force and effect. (Ord. 2004-08. Passed 2-9-04.)

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

applicant may furnish a commercial bond executed by a surety company,
authorized to do business in the State, approved as to sufficiency by the City
Manager and as to legality by the City Solicitor, holding and binding the
principal and sureties to the same liability, and subject to the same
conditions as in the case of policies of insurance provided for hereunder. It

of the insurer or surety thereon, in accordance with such notice, unless a new
policy or certificate of liability insurance or a new indemnity bond, approved

substance whose weight is sufficient to injure the pavements, without first
thoroughly protecting the roadway with a good and sufficient plank or platform.
All such substances, however unloaded, whenever possible shall be piled and
ricked in such a manner as to present a smooth surface to the pavement so that
the weight shall be distributed as much as possible, and when necessary to
prevent injury to the street such piling or ricking shall be made upon a
suitable plank.
901.06 OBSTRUCTING STREETS.
   No person shall obstruct any street by placing in the roadway of the street
any scales, poles, postboxes or any article of any description which may become
an obstruction, without having first obtained the consent of the City Manager

deem proper, he shall cause to be erected and maintained at convenient and
suitable places upon such streets, alleys and public places, suitable boxes for
the collection, casting and temporary deposit therein of such waste paper and
other similar articles of litter, as now are likely to be cast upon the

ashes, rock, stone, mud or other obstruction shall be allowed to impede the
free and convenient use of such sidewalks and streets. However, the provisions
of this section shall not apply to persons who have secured permission to store
building materials during the repair or construction of buildings.
   No owner or occupant of, or any person having the care of, any building or
abutting lot, shall deposit or permit to be deposited, either through his own
physical actions or by his failure to take reasonable preventive measures, any

dirt or other substance within five days after written notification by the City
Manager, and shall barricade and light such obstruction in the street or
sidewalk until complete removal of such debris, stone, dirt or other substance
is effected.
(Ord. 2016-02. Passed 1-25-16.)
901.14 REMEDY OF CITY UPON DEFAULT.
   Upon default of the owner to remove debris, stone, dirt or other substance

certified by the City Auditor to the County Auditor to be placed on the tax
duplicate, and shall be collected in the same manner as taxes are collected and
turned in to the City Treasury, as provided for in Ohio R.C. Chapter 727. This

building materials shall not be granted, in the first instance, for a longer
time than four months, but may be renewed from time to time at the discretion
of the City Engineer for not more than one month at any one time. The permit
shall not authorize the preparation in the streets or places belonging to the
City of materials which can be prepared elsewhere, nor does it authorize the
deposit of materials in or over the gutter so as to prevent a free passage of
water, nor to extend beyond the middle of the street. The permit shall specify

903.01 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person and no department of the City, other than the department in charge
of street repair and the duly accredited officers of such department, shall
make any openings in the surface or pavement of any street, alley, sidewalk or
public way of the City unless a permit to make such opening has been issued in
accordance with the regulations contained in this chapter. The cost of said
permit shall be one dollar ($1.00) per square yard of proposed street opening
(s). ($50.00) minimum fee). This fee is assessed to compensate for the loss of
integrity of street pavements resulting from cutting, excavating and patching
of the street. No permit is to be issued until this administrative/permit fee
is paid.
(Ord. 2021-64. Passed 9-27-21.)
903.02 APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE; SECURITY.
   Any person desiring to make any opening in any surface or pavement of any
street, alley, sidewalk or public way of the City shall file with the City
Engineer, on a blank provided therefor, an application for a permit, which
application shall state the name of the applicant, the name of the street, the
kind of pavement thereon, the purpose of the proposed opening and the exact
size and location of the proposed opening, when, in the opinion of the City
Engineer, such giving of such exact size and location is practicable. Before
any permit can be issued in response to this application, ample security must
be given to the City Auditor to insure the proper restoration and subsequent
maintenance for a period of two years of the street pavement disturbed. Such
security shall be furnished in one of the following ways:
   (a)   A cash deposit may be made with each application sufficient to cover
the cost of restoration; or
   (b)   A general deposit may be made, to be replenished from time to time,
and to constitute a running account against which permits may be issued.
However, no permit shall be issued when the net unencumbered balance in the
account becomes less than the estimated cost of the requisite restoration.
   In the case of City contracts involving the cutting of street pavements,
permits may be issued without a cash deposit, but in such cases sufficient
money to pay for the necessary street restoration shall be withheld from the
contract moneys owing to the contractor until such street restoration is
completed by the contractor to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, or until
such contractor has paid to the City the requisite amount for the street
restoration. The cost of restoring the street surface shall be determined
according to the rules prescribed by the City Engineer, and may be estimated at
a certain price per square foot for each kind of street pavement, or may be
estimated by the actual cost of labor and material necessary to restore the
pavement over the opening, plus a certain percentage for inspection and
maintenance.
   Upon filing of the above application and the presentation of the evidence
that sufficient security is on deposit to cover the estimated cost of restoring
the street as above specified, the City Engineer may issue a permit to make the
opening described in the application, such permit to state the name of the
applicant, the name of the street, the kind of pavement thereon, the purpose of
the proposed opening and the exact size and location of the proposed opening,
when, in the opinion of the City Engineer, the giving of such size and location
is practicable. Where, however, the nature of the proposed work is such as to
require a series of openings close together, and where, in the opinion of the
City Engineer, it is impossible or impracticable to determine in advance the
exact size and location of the proposed openings, a permit may be issued to
cover such series of openings for such length of street as may be deemed proper
by the City Engineer. In such case, however, should any opening be made of
greater size than can be repaved by the deposit on hand, and in case it is
found that such opening has exceeded this size, the City Engineer shall
immediately cause such work on such opening to cease until such deposit is
increased.
   When any City department or division requires the installation of
underground conduits or structures, it may obtain the necessary street opening
permits without any cash deposit. The department or division shall be charged,
however, for the necessary street restoration work, and the amount of the
charge shall be paid out of the appropriation for the respective department or
division. In such cases, the City Manager may, in his discretion direct the
performance of the street restoration work to be done by the Department of
Engineering without charging the department or division for whose purposes the
work is done.
   No cash deposit shall be required from the County of Scioto or the State of
Ohio for street opening permits. Where in any such case the work done inures
greatly to the benefit of the City, the street restoration may, with the
approval of the City Manager, be made at the cost of the City.
   (c)   Upon approval by the City Manager, a public utility company may
annually sign a letter of agreement which states that restoration will be
completed to the satisfaction of the City Engineering Department within the
time specified on the street opening permit and to insure the subsequent
maintenance of the street pavement disturbed for a period of two years.
      (Ord. 2016-43. Passed 6-27-16.)
903.03 OPENINGS BY PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS.
   Where a public utility corporation is authorized by special agreement with
the City to do its own restoration work in connection with the opening of
streets for maintenance and construction work, the required deposit shall be
sufficient to cover inspection costs. If, however, in any case the restoration
is to be made by the City, the deposit shall be increased accordingly. Any such
public utility corporation shall be permitted to maintain with the City Auditor
a general deposit account, to be replenished from time to time, against which
permits may be issued. No permit shall be issued when the net unencumbered
balance is less than the amount necessary to cover the estimated City costs for
inspection and restoration if the same should be required.
(Ord. 1954-46. Passed 4-14-54.)
903.04 STREET CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR FUND.
   All moneys received under the provisions of Section
903.03 as deposits shall be paid to the City Auditor and credited to a fund
known as the Street Construction, Maintenance and Repair Fund, and the cost of
restoring streets, alleys, sidewalks or public ways after such openings have
been made and the backfilling has been satisfactorily completed by the party
making the opening, shall be paid by the Auditor out of such Fund upon the
presentation of the proper voucher of payroll signed according to law.
(Ord. 2016-165. Passed 11-28-16.)
903.05 RESTORATION AND REPAVEMENT.
   Where openings have been or are to be made in a street, the City Engineer
shall provide for the restoration of the street pavement in one of the
following ways:
   (a)   The entire work of restoration, including both paving surface and
paving base, may be performed directly by the department in charge of street
repairs, after the permittee has completed the backfill.
   (b)   The paving surface may be installed by the department in charge of
street repair after the permittee has made the backfill and installed the
pavement base.
   (c)   The work may be done either completely as in subsection (a), or as to
paving surface only, as in subsection (b), by a City contractor hereunto duly
authorized by contract with the City.
   (d)   The entire work of restoration may be done by the permittee.
   In all cases the entire work shall be carried out under the direction and to
the satisfaction of the City Engineer, and in accordance with the rules,
regulations and specifications approved by the City Manager.
(Ord. 2016-166. Passed 11-28-16.)
903.06 AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF CITY ENGINEER.
   The City Engineer is hereby authorized and directed to prepare and to keep
on hand suitable forms for applications to be made and for permits to be
granted under the provisions of this chapter, and to adopt and enforce suitable

927.01 DECLARATION OF NECESSITY AND PURPOSE.
   It is hereby determined and declared to be necessary to the protection of
the public health, safety and welfare to extend the City's sanitary sewerage
system, from time to time, as Council may deem necessary, to operate such
sewerage system, as extended, as a public utility, to issue first mortgage
sewerage system and disposal plant revenue bonds to pay the cost of such
extension and improvements, and to fix rates and charges upon all lots, lands
and premises served by having connections with such sewerage system.
(Ord. 1954-161. Passed 11-24-54.)
927.02 RATES; ACCEPTABLE WASTE.
   The rates for services rendered by the sewerage system of the City for its
services to its corporation, inhabitants and other users, shall be reasonable
and just and in any event shall be at all times sufficient to produce gross
revenues adequate:
   (a)   To pay the reasonable and proper expenses of operation and maintenance
of the system;
   (b)   To pay when due the principal and interest charges, including required
reserves and any mandatory coverage required by any bonds outstanding, payable
from revenues of the system; and
   (c)   To pay semiannual installments due and payable to the Ohio Water
Development Authority in repayment of any loans made to the City for the
improvements of the system.
   No user shall discharge into the system any nonacceptable sewage or
industrial waste from any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or
premises or waste or sewage of such character that it will damage the sewerage
or disposal system or cannot be treated satisfactorily by the disposal system.
The City Manager may compel such users to dispose of such waste and prevent it
from entering the system. Acceptable industrial waste is hereby defined to be
liquid organic waste materials not containing toxic or explosive elements
injurious to sewers or sewage treatment processes.
   In cases where the character of the sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes
an unreasonable burden upon the sewage pumping, treatment or disposal works
greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering such sewage works, the
City Manager may, if he deems it advisable, compel such manufacturing or
industrial plant, building or premises, to pretreat such sewage in such manner
as he shall specify before discharging such sewage into the sewerage system of
the City.
   If such pretreatment is not so ordered or accomplished, the City Manager
shall recommend to Council the levying of a surcharge which shall be in
addition to the regular charge. Council thereupon, by ordinance, may fix the
amount of the surcharge.
   Any user who discharges nonacceptable sewage or industrial waste into the
system and causes damage thereto by reason of such action shall be liable to
the City for such damage.
   In cases where all or a large part of the water furnished to a consumer does
not find its way into the sewerage system, the City Manager shall make such
adjustment in rates as he may deem just and equitable.
(Ord. 2016-73. Passed 8-22-16.)
927.03 RATES; CITY'S RIGHTS RESERVED.
   The City reserves the right to increase the sewer rates at any time should
the revenues of the system prove insufficient to pay the operating and
maintenance expenses and the debt charges provided by the ordinance authorizing
the issuance of the sewer revenue bonds.
(Ord. 2016-74. Passed 8-22-16.)
927.04 PAYMENT OF SEWER AND WATER BILLS; DISCONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   Since the sewer bills are based on water consumption, the City will not
accept payment of any water bill without payment also of the sewer bill, and if
any bill remains unpaid as provided in Chapter
933, the City may cut off the water supply to such sewer user until the sewer
and water bills are paid.
(Ord. 1954-161. Passed 11-24-54.)
927.05 GRACE PERIOD; REMEDY FOR NONPAYMENT.
   All charges of sewer and sewage disposal service shall become due and
payable as provided in Chapter
933. If not paid as provided in Chapter
933 such delinquent charges may be certified to the County Auditor to be
collected in the same manner as other City taxes under the provisions of Ohio
R.C. 729.49.
(Ord. 1954-161. Passed 11-24-54.)
927.06 LIABILITY OF OWNERS AND LESSEES.
   The owner of private property which is served by the sewerage system by
pipes connected with the system to convey away sewage, shall, as well as the
lessee of the premises, be liable to the City for all service of such system
rendered to such premises.
(Ord. 1954-161. Passed 11-24-54.)
927.07 CONNECTIONS TO SEWERAGE SYSTEM; OUTSIDE TOILETS PROHIBITED. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former Section
927.07 was repealed by Ordinance 2016-75, passed August 22, 2016.)
927.08 RULES AND REGULATIONS; AUTHORITY OF CITY MANAGER.
   The City Manager shall make and enforce such rules and regulations as may be
deemed necessary for the safe, economical and efficient management and
protection of the City's sewerage system and the sewage pumping, treatment and
disposal works, for the construction and use of house sewers and connections to
the sewerage system and for the regulation, collection and adjustment of such
charges.

on the Scioto County real property tax list and duplicate for the property so
serviced, with penalties and interest, and be collected as other taxes and
liens. A penalty of ten percent (10%) on the amount that is due and payable
shall be added to the certified amount. The City shall provide the property
owner with a written notice of the impending certification at least thirty (30)

conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from fire fighting activities.
Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being
necessary to protect public health and safety. Dye testing is an allowable
discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement
agency prior to the time of the test. The prohibition shall not apply to any
non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority
of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is
in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and
other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has
been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.

suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or
to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the State. If
the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the State, or to minimize
danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge.  Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his/her MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (c)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to

operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his/her
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
MS4. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with Chapter
937, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions
of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

preliminary plan of the subdivision and approval of the construction plans for
the streets and improvements. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to
approve, disapprove or make revisions in the preliminary plan and in the
construction plans. Tentative approval of the preliminary plan shall not be
construed as acceptance of the subdivision.
   (c)   Construct and install the improvements in accordance with the
construction plans as approved by the Planning Commission, or in lieu thereof,
enter into a contract with the City, together with a bond in a sufficient
amount and with sufficient sureties guaranteeing the completion, without cost
to the City, of all the improvements in accordance with the construction plans.
The subdivider shall be financially responsible for the construction of all of
such improvements, and such improvements shall be completed, or such contract
and bond as herein provided shall be executed and approved by the City, before
the final plan of such subdivision is submitted to the Planning Commission for
its approval.
   (d)   Submit the final plan of the subdivision or development to the
Planning Commission and obtain its approval and, if the subdivision or
development is within the corporate limits of the City, also obtain the
acceptance and approval of such plan by Council.

(3)   Minor streets abutting property on both sides, which is restricted by 26**
deeds or zoning to not over two families per residence -
(4)   Other minor streets -                                                 32**
(5)   Cul-de-sacs shall have a turnaround pavement with inside radius -     14
   with outside radius -                                                    40
      *   Except in cases where the approved major street section of the
Regional Thoroughfare Plan or of the Official Map of Thoroughfares or of the
State Highway Department specifies a greater or lesser width. The owner is not
required to provide more than the cost of a minor street pavement as specified
in subsections (c)(3) and (4) hereof.
      **   The Planning Commission may permit a pavement of not less than
twenty feet in width for minor streets and roads where the subdivision or area
is located outside the corporate limits and where conditions A. and B. exist,
and inside the corporate limits where condition C. exists:
         A.   The tract is not abutting and is not within one and one-half
miles from any State highway, and
         B.   The tract does not have and is not within one mile from any area
now having municipal water, sewer or waste collection service.
         C.   The topography is such that it would not be feasible from an
engineering standpoint to build a street of wider width. In such instances
parking would be prohibited on both sides of the street and a note indicating
that no parking shall be permitted shall be placed on the recorded subdivision
plat. The subdivision that falls within this determination shall meet all other
requirements of these Regulations including right of way, vertical grade and
dimensions of cul-de-sacs. A guard rail shall be required where the incline of
the slope exceeds 3:1 and where the height of the embankment is three feet or
greater.
         (Ord. 1970-119. Passed 12-30-70.)
1111.04 MINIMUM ALIGNMENT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Vertical.
      (1)   For primary and major thoroughfares, State highways and parkways,
profile grades shall be connected by vertical curves of a minimum length
(projected horizontally) equivalent to fifteen times the algebraic difference
between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred. State highways shall
comply with any stricter requirements of the State Department of
Transportation.
      (2)   For minor streets and alleys, one-half the minimum of subsection
(a)(1) hereof. Any increase between two rates of grade in this section shall
not exceed two percent (2%) if avoidable.
   (b)   Horizontal. See Section
1111.03(a).
   (Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)
1111.05 INTERSECTIONS.
   (a)   Streets shall intersect as nearly at right angles as possible.
   (b)   Adequate corner clearance shall be provided, and no fence or shrubbery
over three feet high shall be located so as to cause a traffic hazard.
   (c)   Property line corners shall be rounded with a curve (or cut with a
straight line) on an arc approximately concentric with the radius of the curb
or edge of the pavement, the minimum radius of which shall be ten feet on major
and secondary thoroughfares and in business districts.
   (d)   Street curbs or edges of street pavements shall be rounded by radii of
at least twenty feet.
   (e)   The minimum radii in subsections (c) and (d) hereof shall be increased
when the smallest angle is less than sixty degrees, or in any case where the
Planning Commission considers it necessary.
   (f)   Reverse curves in a curb line or edge of a street pavement shall be
separated by a tangent of suitable length.
   (g)   Jogs shall not be made at intersections.
   (Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)
1111.06 BLOCKS.
   (a)   The maximum length of blocks shall be 1,300 feet.
   (b)   Blocks over 900 feet long shall have a crosswalkway approximately at
center.
   (c)   The width of blocks shall be sufficient to allow normally, two tiers
of lots of approximately equal depth.
   (d)   Irregular shaped blocks (including superblocks) indented by cul-de-
sacs and containing parks and playgrounds, may, if properly designed, be
adequately provided with parks, playgrounds and parking space and with
agreements as to the maintenance of public areas.
   (e)   The long dimension of a block shall front on a major thoroughfare (to
minimize intersections).
   (f)   Business and industrial blocks shall be designed for their prospective
use.
(Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)
1111.07 RESIDENTIAL LOTS.
   (a)   The size, shape and orientation of residential lots shall be
appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and to the types of
development contemplated, and in conformity with the Zoning Code.
   (b)   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. A ratio of
three and one-half to one shall normally be considered as a desirable maximum
for widths of sixty feet and over.
   (c)   If topography permits, lots fronting on main traffic ways should have
extra depth and deep setbacks.
   (d)   Every lot shall abut on a street or other public right of way.
   (e)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided.
   (f)   Side lines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial to
the street line, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, a variation
from this rule will give a better street and lot plan. On curved streets, the
lot line shall be radial to the curve whenever possible.
   (g)   Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to permit maintenance of
building lines on both front and side.
   (h)   Where irregularity of ownership or street lines inevitably produces
small remnant lots, such areas shall be added to adjoining lots or left
unplatted and marked to be left in that status until such time as arrangements
may be made with the adjoining property owners for the proper platting of such
places.
(Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)
1111.08 PUBLIC OPEN SPACES AND SITES.
   Where, as indicated by the Master Plan, a proposed subdivision contains,
wholly or in part, a proposed public open space or a proposed site for a public
building, such areas shall be dedicated to a public agency or reserved for
acquisition thereby within a period of five years by purchase or other means.
   Normally the Planning Commission shall require that from five to ten percent
of the area of a subdivision, exclusive of streets, be allocated for
recreational areas.
   In determining such areas for dedication or reservation, however, the
Commission shall take into consideration the prospective character of the
development, whether dense, residential, open residential, business or
industrial. The Commission may reduce or waive the requirements for open space
and sites in special situations where they would cause undue hardship or where
there exists adequate open space to serve the population in the area to be
platted. Where a subdivided area is too small to provide an open space of
suitable size and character, the Commission may require provision of such a
tract as may be combined with open spaces provided or to be provided in
adjoining areas, so as to produce a total area of adequate size.
   Due regard shall be shown for preserving outstanding natural or cultural
features such as scenic spots or watercourses, exceptionally fine groves of
trees and historic sites or structures. Provision for public ownership is
usually the best means of assuring their preservation.
(Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)
1111.09 ACCURACY.
   Any owner or proprietor of lots or grounds within the City who subdivides or
lays them out for sale shall cause to be made an accurate map or final plat of
such subdivision describing with certainty all grounds laid out or granted for
streets, alleys, ways, commons or other public uses. Lots platted, sold,
auctioned or intended for sale shall be numbered by progressive numbers or
described by the squares in which situated and the precise length and width
shall be given of each lot sold or intended for sale. Such map or plat shall be
subscribed by the owner or owners, the proprietor or developer, the mortgage
holder with his certificate of consent, the surveyor or engineer, the proper
municipal authorities and the City Planning Commission. Such signature of the
owner or owners or proprietor or developer or his agent duly authorized in
writing shall be acknowledged before an officer authorized to take the
acknowledgement of deeds, who shall certify the acknowledgement of the
instrument.

1113.12 MONUMENTS.
   Accurate location of all monuments shall conform to Ohio R.C. 711.03, as
follows:
   At the time of surveying and laying out a village, or subdivision or
addition to a municipal corporation, the proprietor of such village, or
subdivision or addition, shall plant at the corner of the public ground or lot,
if there is such, and if there is none, then at the corner of one of the inlots
and at the corner of each outlot, a good and sufficient stone, of such size and
dimensions and in such manner as the surveyor provided for under Ohio R.C.
711.01 directs, for a corner from which to make future surveys, and the point
at which it may be found shall be designated on the plat.
   Such proprietor shall direct the surveyor to place and set at least four
permanent markers in each plat of ten lots or less. In a village or in a
subdivision, addition or allotment having more than ten lots, whether within or
without a municipal corporation, the proprietor shall cause to be placed as
many additional permanent markers as the surveyor deems necessary to properly
control his original survey. Such permanent markers shall be placed in a manner
so that the line of sight between such markers can be observed from one marker
to the other. Such markers shall be made of either stone or concrete at least
four inches in diameter, or four inches square, and properly marked. The
markings on such markers shall consist of a cross cut with the legs of the
cross at least three inches long and at least one-eighth inch deep. Solid iron
pins of at least one inch diameter may also be used as permanent markers. All
stone, concrete or iron pin markers shall be at least thirty inches long and
the bottom of such markers shall be set at least thirty inches below finished
grade.
   If the location for a permanent marker is originally determined to be in an
area of solid rock, it may be relocated and offset from its original position.
Such relocation must be noted on the plat. These and all other markers shall be
designated on the plat before it is presented for record, but setting of such
markers shall not be required prior to the completion of construction necessary
to the improvement of the land.

   In lieu of actual completion of such improvements the subdivider may elect
one of the following alternatives:
   (a)   Deposit a cash sum with the City for the improvements required by
these Subdivision Regulations, the estimate of this sum to be approved by the
City Engineer for areas within the City and unincorporated areas with whose
owners negotiations are being made for annexation to the City and for water and
sewer extensions beyond the corporate limits of the City.
   (b)   Enter into a contract with the City whereby the owner, subdivider or
developer promises to provide or pay for all improvements required by these
Subdivision Regulations and posts a surety bond in an amount of ten percent
(10%) of the estimated cost of the improvement to guarantee the completion of
the work.
      (Ord. 1966-45. Passed 5-12-66.)

CHAPTER 1117
Hillside Regulations
1117.01   Purpose.
1117.02   Location of areas subject to regulations.
1117.03   Areas covered by regulations.
1117.04   Responsibility of developer.
1117.05   Geologic report required.
1117.06   Building permit.
1117.99   Penalty.
 
 
1117.01 PURPOSE.
   Certain hillsides within the corporate boundaries of the City exhibit
special and distinctive characteristics including, but not limited to,
geological strata, soil formations, slopes, vegetation and water flow.
   The purpose of this chapter is to assist the development of lands and
structures to be compatible with the existing physical conditions and to
protect the environment and existing improved lands in those locations where
the environment is vulnerable to damage by development permitted under
conventional zoning and building regulations.
   Hillside regulations are required to protect the property owners and the
public from damages caused by building upon or developing properties and areas
of sensitive environmental qualities; from unsafe buildings on unstable land
which would be caused by uncontrolled development; from soil erosion and stream
siltation; from destruction of mature and/or valuable trees and other
vegetation.
(Ord. 1985-13. Passed 2-12-85.)
1117.02 LOCATION OF AREAS SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS.
   The location of all areas subject to these hillside regulations shall be
shown on the building map of the City as an overlay zone superimposed over
existing zones.
   Council may from time to time expand the areas subject to this chapter.
(Ord. 1985-13. Passed 2-12-85.)
1117.03 AREAS COVERED BY REGULATIONS.
   The areas covered by these hillside regulations shall be all those currently
underdeveloped or undeveloped lands or lots with a slope of ten percent (10%)
or more and/or the existence of KOPE geologic formations. A KOPE formation
consists of bedrock material composed of approximately eighty percent (80%)
shale and twenty percent (20%) limestone overlaid by silts or clays, thus
creating a slideplane at their interface.
(Ord. 1985-13. Passed 2-12-85.)
1117.04 RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPER.
   It shall be the responsibility of the developer in the case of subdivisions,
or the property owner in the case of individual lots, to have prepared by a
professional engineer, registered under the laws of the State with expertise in
geology, a geological investigation and report attesting to specific site
conditions and the extent, if any, to which the site can be modified by removal
of vegetation, altering the natural flow of water, cutting or filling. The
report shall be sealed by the engineer performing the evaluation.
(Ord. 1985-13. Passed 2-12-85.)
1117.05 GEOLOGIC REPORT REQUIRED.
   The geologic report shall be submitted to the City Planning Commission who
shall evaluate its contents and any other applicable data and information and
render a decision within sixty days of report submission.
(Ord. 1985-13. Passed 2-12-85.)
1117.06 BUILDING PERMIT.
   The City Building Official shall not issue a permit for construction or
addition to any existing building until the decision of the City Planning
Commission has been reached.
   In reviewing and acting upon the geological report required by this chapter,
the Planning Commission shall be reviewing it solely to determine if the terms
and conditions of this chapter have been complied with. By approving the report
and issuing a permit, the City is not adopting the report as its own, and shall
not be responsible for any consequences resulting therefrom. The responsibility
shall be that of the engineer and developer, builder or owner.
(Ord. 1985-44. Passed 5-14-85.)
1117.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of these hillside regulations by doing or
causing to be done any of the things prohibited herein, or by failing or
refusing to do any of the things herein required to be done, or otherwise
violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the
provisions of these regulations shall be fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. Each day
such violation of failure to comply with the provisions of these regulations
exists after notification thereof shall constitute a separate offense, and each
and every violation shall constitute a separate offense.

         (Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1131.13 RULES OF MEASUREMENT.
   (a)   Measuring Lot Dimensions.
      (1)   A lot extends to its lot lines, which should be coterminous with
the lot lines of abutting lots or with the boundaries of a public right-of-way.
      (2)   Area dimensions are measured on a horizontal plane in plan view and
do not consider topography or the actual surface area of non-level ground.
      (3)   Areas of lots that are occupied by easements, such as access or
utility easements, contribute to total lot area and are considered in
calculating impervious coverage and other standards.
      (4)   Lot frontage is the aggregate length of all front lot lines.
      (5)   Impervious coverage is the percent of the lot's horizontal plane
that is occupied by impervious, man-made materials, including buildings,
asphalt, concrete, swimming pools, barns, and carports, but excluding porous
pavement, permeable pavers, decks with gaps between decking for drainage, lawn
grasses, gardens, and other landscaping.
   (b)   Measuring Setbacks.
      (1)   When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum setback,
the measurement is made at the point where the two (2) entities are closest.
      (2)   Where a lot borders two streets that do not intersect at a corner
of the lot, such as in a through lot, two (2) front lot lines will exist, one
along each right-of-way. The required front setback must be provided for each
street frontage.
      (3)   When a lot borders two (2) or more streets that intersect at the
corner(s) of the lot, such as in a corner lot, the front setback shall be
provided for each street frontage.
      (4)   When a lot borders one street with an acute curve of fifty-five
(55) degrees or more so that the street effectively creates two (2) sides of
the lot, the lot line(s) along that street shall be considered a front lot
line, and a front setback shall be applied to the entire lot frontage.
      (5)   Lot lines abutting alleys are not considered front lot lines and do
not require front setbacks.
   (c)   Measuring Structure Height.
      (1)   Structure height is measured as the difference in elevation of:
         A.   A horizontal line at the average grade along the structure's
front elevation; and
         B.   The highest point of the roof, including parapets and cornices.
      (2)   Exceptions.
         A.   Renewable energy generation systems may exceed the maximum
structure height defined for the district by up to five (5) feet.
         B.   Chimneys, elevators, poles, spires, tanks, towers, and other
similar projections may exceed the maximum structure height defined for the
district by up to fourteen (14) feet.
         C.   Spires and steeples on structures used for religious assembly
shall not be subject to structure height limitations.

1135.01 INTRODUCTION TO USES.
   (a)   Allowed Uses.  Land and structures may only be used or intended to be
used for purposes expressly permitted by the Comprehensive Use Table of this
Zoning Code.
      (1)   Permitted Uses. A permitted use is subject to administrative
approval.
      (2)   Conditionally Permitted Uses. A conditionally permitted use is
subject to quasi-judicial approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may -- in addition to zone- or district-specific development
standards set forth in Chapter
1133; in addition to any use-specific standards set forth in Chapter
1135; and in addition to any generally applicable standards set forth in
Chapter
1137 -- set forth requirements that will, in its judgment, render the
conditionally permitted use compatible with the existing and future use of
adjacent lots and the vicinity.
   (b)   Uses Not Listed. No land or structure may be used for any purpose not
expressly listed in the Zoning Code as permitted or conditionally permitted
unless such use is determined by the Building Officer to be similar in
definition and impact to a permitted or conditionally permitted use.
   (c)   Similar Uses Not Listed.
      (1)   Any person may submit to the Building Officer an application for
zoning approval for any use of land or structure that is similar in definition
and impact to a permitted or conditionally permitted use.
      (2)   The Building Officer shall then determine whether the use is
similar in definition and impact to a listed permitted or conditionally
permitted use. If, in the judgment of the Building Officer, the use is similar
in definition and impact to a listed permitted or conditionally permitted use,
the proposed use shall be determined to be likewise permitted or conditionally
permitted, and, provided that the proposed use complies with all other
requirements of this Zoning Code, a zoning permit shall be issued.
      (3)   The applicant may appeal the decision of the Building Officer to
the Commission. The Commission shall have the right to override the Building
Officer's determination if it should find that the deter- mination was
arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.
      (4)   The determination by the Building Officer or the Commission shall
be for the purpose of enabling the applicant to otherwise comply with the
zoning regu- lations regarding necessary applications or permits to be
obtained. The decision shall in no way act as a commitment by the Commission or
any other agency of the City as to future zoning, approval of conditional uses,
or any other zoning matter.
   (d)   Use-Specific Regulations. Certain uses are subject to specific
regulations, which are set forth in this chapter.

1135.17 TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of towers and Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public,
while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City. Specifically,
the purposes of this chapter are:
      (1)   To direct the location of towers and Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities in the City.
      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities through careful design, siting, and landscaping
techniques.
      (4)   To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of towers and
Antenna Support Structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers.
      (5)   To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties caused by towers
and Wireless Telecommu- nications Facilities by ensuring such structures are
soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed.
      (6)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that towers and Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses.
      (7)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that proposed towers and
Wireless Telecommunications Facilities are designed in harmony with natural
settings and in a manner consistent with current development patterns.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   All towers, Antenna Support Structures, and Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities, any portion of which are located within the
city, are subject to this chapter.
      (2)   Except as provided in this chapter, any use being made of an
existing tower or Antenna Support Structure on the effective date of this
section (herein "Nonconforming Structures") shall be allowed to continue even
if in conflict with the terms of this section. Any tower site that has received
City approval in the form of a Special Permit or building permit, but has not
yet been constructed or located, shall be considered a Nonconforming Structure
so long as such approval is current and not expired.
   (c)   Use Regulations. Wireless Telecommunications Facilities shall be a
conditional use in the Industrial Flex District, contingent upon a number of
requirements being met. These criteria are in place in an attempt to minimize
adverse health, safety, public welfare or visual impacts through buffering,
siting, design and construction, and reduction of the need for new towers.
   (d)   Application Requirements. The following additional information shall
be provided when applying for a conditional use approval:
      (1)   A plot plan indicating all building uses within 200 feet of the
proposed facility. Aerial photos and/ or renderings may be required.
      (2)   A diagram or map showing the viewshed of the proposed Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities or Antenna Support Structure.
      (3)   Photo simulations of the proposed facility from affected
residential properties and public rights-of- way at varying distances.
      (4)   A list of the location of every tower, building, or structure
within the area that could support the proposed antenna. The applicant must
show that it has pursued a reasonable shared use arrangement with the owner(s)
of the existing towers and that such pursuit was unsuccessful.
   (e)   Standards.
      (1)   The tower and Equipment Shelter shall be 1,000 feet from the
nearest dwelling use or public park.
      (2)   The maximum size of the Equipment Shelter shall not exceed 400
square feet.
      (3)   Minimum setback for the tower from all property lines shall be a
distance equal to the height of the tower. Setback shall be defined as the
distance from the property line to the nearest portion of the structure. The
Equipment Shelter shall meet the minimum setback requirements applicable to
accessory structures.
      (4)   Underground wiring to the site shall be required.
      (5)   Equipment, mobile or immobile, not used in direct support of the
transmission or relay facility, shall not be stored or parked on the site
except in connection with a repair or maintenance being made to the
installation.
      (6)   The owner of the tower shall annually file with the Building
Officer a declaration ascertaining the continued operations, according to the
Board of Zoning Appeal's approval, of each tower approved.
      (7)   Obsolete or unused facilities shall be removed within six (6)
months of ceasing operation.
      (8)   No employees shall be employed on a regular basis at the
installation site.
      (9)   The location of the tower and Equipment Shelter and Antenna Support
Structure shall comply with all natural resource protection standards
established in the Zoning Code.
      (10)   Security fencing eight (8) feet in height shall be required to
surround the tower, Equipment Shelter and any guy wires, either completely or
individually as determined by the Board of Zoning Appeals. No barbed or razor
wire shall be permitted. The City and co-locators shall have reasonable access.
No fence shall be required on top of a building or other structure if access to
the roof or top of the structure or building is secure.
      (11)   Buffer plantings shall be located around the perimeter of the
security fence as deemed appropriate by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Options
are an evergreen screen to be planted that consists of either a hedge, planted
three (3) feet on center maximum, or a row of evergreen trees planted five (5)
feet on center maximum, or other screens determined to be appropriate by the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (12)   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to the
maximum extent possible.
      (13)   The tower shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or similar color
minimizing its visibility, unless otherwise required by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
      (14)   Except for tower or Monopole structures, all appurtenances shall

   All uses, structures, and lots in any district must comply with the
generally applicable standards set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.02  GENERAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   Each use subject to the provisions of this Zoning Code shall be located,
arranged, and operated in accordance with the following performance standards
in order to minimize the use's interfere with the development and enjoyment of
adjacent properties.
   (a)   Vibrations and Noise.  Noise or vibration shall be so controlled that
at the property line on which such noise or vibration is produced it will not
be at a level above that normally perceptible from other developments in the
area or from the usual street traffic observed at the street right-of-way line
of the lot, except occasional blast or shock required in normal operation and
produced in such manner as not to create a hazard.
   (b)   Smoke. Smoke shall be controlled in its emission so as to be less dark
in shade than that designated as No. 2 on the Ringelman Chart, except that an
emission above such level shall be permitted for a period of three (3) minutes
or less during the operation of starting or cleaning a fire.
    (c)   Dust. Dust or particulate matter shall be so controlled as not to
produce a hazardous, or obnoxious situation beyond the property lines of the
lot on which such dust or particulate matter is produced.
   (d)   Fire and Explosion Hazards. All activities, including storage,
involving flammable or explosive materials shall include the provision of
adequate safety devices against the hazard of fire and explosion.
All standards enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
shall be adhered to. Burning of waste materials in open fire is prohibited, as
enforced by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
    (e)   Liquid and Solid Wastes. No discharge at any point into any public
sewer, private sewage disposal system, stream, or the ground of any materials
of such nature or temperature as can contaminate any water supply or interfere
with bacterial processes in sewage treatment shall be permitted. The standards
of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency shall apply.
    (f)   Odor and Glare.  Odor or noxious fumes shall be so controlled as not
to be offensive nor to create a hazard. Glare or heat from processing or other
activity or lighting shall be so screened as not to be perceptible beyond the
property lines of the lot on which such glare or heat is produced.
      (Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.03  PARKING STANDARDS.
   (a)   Parking Space Count. No minimum parking space count is established.
   (b)   Location of Parking Areas.
      (1)   No parking area may be situated closer to the front lot line than
any front-facing exterior wall of any principal structure(s) on the same lot.
         A.   This provision does not apply to both frontages of through-lots.
For through-lots, no parking area may be situated closer to the "addressed
front lot line" than any front-facing exterior wall of any principal structure
(s) on the same lot, where the "addressed front lot line" is the front lot line
which is least distant from the principal structure and/or is architecturally
addressed by the principal structure, such as by a front porch, a formal
entryway, or columns. If both front lot lines of a through-lot are equidistant
from the principal structure(s) and are both architecturally addressed by a
principal structure, no parking area may be situated closer to either front lot
line than any front-facing exterior wall of any principal structure(s) on the
lot.
         B.   For any parking area on a lot without a principal structure, the
parking area may not be closer to the front lot line than any front-facing
exterior wall of any principal structure on any side-adjacent lot(s). For this
requirement, a side-adjacent lot is a lot that abuts the lot in question and
fronts the same street or streets as the lot in question.
         C.   This provision does not prohibit vehicles from parking upon a
driveway, even when such driveway is closer to a front lot line than any front-
facing exterior wall of any principal structure(s) on the same lot.
      (2)   Any parking area must comply with the required front setback for
principal structures in the district in which it is located.
   (c)   Pedestrian Walkways. Pedestrian walkways must be provided within the
vehicle use space of all parking area and drive-thru facilities, as follows:
      (1)   Pedestrian walkways must connect adjacent sidewalks on each street
frontage with the entrance(s) of the establishment, and pedestrian walkways
must connect parking areas for the establishment's employees and visitors with
the entrance(s) of the establishment.
      (2)   The pedestrian walkways must be at least four (4) feet wide and
must be unobstructed by vegetation, parking spaces, steps, utility poles, and
other permanent objects. On lots with one (1) or more commercial use(s),
pedestrian walkways must be at least five (5) feet in width and must be paved
with a material that meets or exceeds the Americans with Disabilities Act
accessibility requirements.
      (3)   If the pedestrian walkways are abutting or within a vehicle use
area, the pedestrian walkways shall be clearly marked and distinguished with
reflective pavement markings. Vehicle use lanes within parking areas should be
designed to avoid such pedestrian walkways.
      (4)   If a pedestrian walkway is crossed by a vehicle use lane, the
pedestrian walkaway must be constructed so that its elevation is at least four
inches higher than the elevation of the vehicle use lane. To cross such an
elevated pedestrian walkway, vehicles must mount the elevated pedestrian
walkway via a ramped paved surface with at least a 1:1 rise:run steepness,
effectively slowing the vehicles and enhancing pedestrian safety.
Alternatively, a speed hump of at least four inches of height can be installed
in the vehicle use lane exactly two feet in advance of the pedestrian walkway.
   (d)   Parking Area Surfaces.
      (1)   Parking areas must have improved surfaces that do not contribute
dust, gravel, sand, or soil to the air, water, or ground surface outside of the
lot.
   
   (e)   ADA Parking Requirements.
      (1)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be construed to conflict with the
regulations set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
      (2)   Parking spaces designated and designed for people with disabilities
shall be in compliance with the universal parking space design set forth in the
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Standards, Section 208 and
Section 502, which can be reviewed at the following website: https:/
/ www.access-board.gov/ada/.
      (3)   All such spaces shall be designated by free-standing signs pursuant
to the Ohio Secretary of State guidelines.
      (Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.04  DRIVE-THRU STANDARDS.
   (a)   All queuing vehicles shall be located on the lot on which the drive-
thru services are being provided and shall not interfere with the movement of
vehicles or pedestrians on public rights-of-way.
   (b)   All establishments with drive-thrus must provide a by-pass lane
whereby vehicles may exit the lot at any point without proceeding through the
drive-thru lane.
   (c)   Menu boards may not flash or have any visible bulbs. All menu boards
must be oriented toward the drive-thru aisle that they are serving.
   (d)   Drive-thru speakers shall not be audible from adjacent properties.
Drive-thru speakers shall not emit outdoor music.
(Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.05 SIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the City's intent to provide business and industry in
the City with equitable sign standards in accordance with fair competition and
aesthetic standards acceptable to the community; to provide the public with a
safe and effective means of locating businesses, services and points of
interest within the City; and to provide for a safe vehicular and pedestrian
traffic environment. This chapter is based on the premise that signs are
subject to control in order to reduce nuisances to adjacent properties or the
community in general, or depreciate the value of other properties within the
community. To mitigate the potential negative consequences, reasonable
limitations on signs are appropriate with respect to the size, height, and
construction of signs, and the time, place, and manner of their display.
   (b)   Permitted Sign Types by District. Sign types are permitted in
districts only as regulated by the Comprehensive Sign Table.
   (c)   Permitted Sign Count.  Sign count regulations are set forth in the
Sign Type, Area, Height, and Setback Standards, found in Section
1137.055.
   (d)   Permitted Sign Area.  Sign area regulations are set forth in the Sign
Type, Area, Height, and Setback Standards, found in Section
 1137.055.
   
   (e)   Permitted Sign Height. Sign height regulations are set forth in the
Sign Type, Area, Height, and Setback Standards, found in Section
1137.055.
   (f)   Required Sign Setback.  Sign setbacks requirements are set forth in
the Sign Type, Area, Height, and Setback Standards, found in Section
 1137.055.
   (g)   Regulations by Sign Type.

bench sign may exceed four (4) feet in height. Only one (1) bench sign may be
erected per fifty (50) feet of frontage per lot. No bench sign may be erected
within the public right-of-way except with written permission of the City.
      (4)   Flag sign. Each flag sign may not exceed a sign area of twenty-four
(24) square feet. When measuring sign area for flag signs, the entire fabric
area shall be considered the sign area.
      (5)   Freestanding sign. No freestanding sign may be within ten (10) feet
of any other freestanding sign.
      (6)   Projecting sign. A projecting sign may extend over the public
right-of-way only when authorized by a valid permit. A projecting sign must

180 days within one (1) calendar year.
      (9)   Wall sign. The difference in elevation of the lowest part of a wall
sign and the highest part of that wall sign may not exceed ten percent (10%) of
the height of the structure on which it is mounted. The Building Officer may
designate a wall sign as a public art mural, which is exempt from these sign
regulations.
      (10)   Window sign. A window sign facing a sidewalk and at an elevation
between three (3) and eight (8) feet above sidewalk grade may not exceed twenty
percent (20%) of the window area of the window in which it is displayed. Signs
displayed in a window, including neon and neon-imitating "open" signs, hours of
operation signs, and sale signs are considered window signs, even if not
adhered directly to the window.
   (h)   Exempt Signs. These sign regulations shall not regulate:

to-day operations of a business, such as a sign attached to a bus or lettered
on a motor vehicle, unless the primary purpose of such vehicle is for such
advertising;

1137.055 SIGN TYPE, AREA, HEIGHT, AND SETBACK STANDARDS.
   (a)   A property may display any number of signs, provided that the signs
are of a sign type allowed in the district and provided that the aggregate sign
area of all signs (in square feet) on the lot does not exceed one-half of the
lot's frontage (in linear feet) or 300 square feet, whichever is less. For
example, a lot with forty (40) feet of frontage may display up to twenty (20)
square feet of sign area, distributed over any number of signs.
   (b)   No individual sign may exceed a sign area (in square feet) equal to
the front setback of the sign (in linear feet) or twelve (12) square feet,
whichever is more. For example, if a sign has a front setback of twenty (20)
feet, it may not exceed twenty (20) square feet in sign area.
   (c)   No building-mounted sign may exceed a sign height equal to fourteen
(14) feet plus one-third of the sign's front setback. For example, if a
building-mounted sign has a front setback of twenty-four (24) feet, it may not
exceed twenty-two (22) feet in sign height.
   (d)   No freestanding sign may exceed a sign height equal to four (4) feet

additional application materials;
         B.   The building permit application is complete but is denied and
indicating the rationale for such determination and optionally recommending
that the applicant seeks a variance or other remedy;
         C.   The building permit application is complete, and the proposed
project complies with the regulations of the Zoning Code, and a building permit

project nearly complies with regulations of the Zoning Code and, with a de
minimis variance, fully complies with the regulations of the Zoning Code, and a

determine that the strict application of the Zoning Code would create practical
difficulties for the property owner in using the property for its intended
purpose(s).

the land or structure and not applying generally throughout the district;
      (4)   A statement showing that the special conditions and circumstances
do not result from the actions of the applicant;
      (5)   A statement showing that the granting of the application is
necessary to the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights;
      (6)   Such other information regarding the application for variance as
may be pertinent or required for appropriate action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals;
      (7)   A list containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners of
property within 250 feet of the parcel at issue; and
      (8)   A fee, as indicated by a fee schedule approved by Council, that
covers the cost of mailing notices and other expenses involved in a hearing
before the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   If such application for variance is made, the Building Officer, during
review of the building permit application, shall review all other elements of
the zoning permit application. If all other elements of the building permit
application are found to be compliant with the regulations of the Zoning Code,
the Building Officer shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of
the building permit application initial submission or re-submission, forward
the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals with certification of
compliance, pending the approval of a variance.
   (d)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon receipt of the application, shall
begin the review and hearing procedures as outlined later in this chapter.
   (e)   A variance, if approved, is valid until the structure that is the
subject of the variance is structurally modified or a use is changed, except
when the Board of Zoning Appeals prescribes other expiration conditions during
its approval of the variance.
(Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)
1141.10  CONDITIONAL USE APPROVALS.
   (a)   If a building permit application proposes the conduct of a use that is
listed as a conditionally permitted use in the district in which it is located,
it shall include the following elements in addition to the standard
requirements of a building permit application:
      (1)   A statement of the necessity or desirability of the proposed use to
the neighborhood or community; and
      (2)   A statement of the relationship of the proposed use to adjacent
property and land use.
      (3)   A list containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners of
property within 250 feet of the parcel at issue.
   (b)   The Building Officer shall review all other elements of the building
permit application. If all other elements of the building permit application
are found to be compliant with the regulations of the Zoning Code, the Building
Officer shall, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the building
permit application, forward the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals with
certification of compliance, pending the approval of the conditional use.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon receipt of the application, shall
begin the review and hearing procedures as outlined later in this chapter.
(Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)

provided by the Building Officer via First Class Mail at least fifteen (15)
calendar days before the public hearing to all property owners of lots within
250 feet of the lot lines of the parcel(s) of concern. Addresses for the

      (4)   The Board or Commission may pose questions to the applicant, to the
Building Officer, or to legal counsel during the public hearing.
   (f)   Decision Criteria.
      (1)   Variances.  Variances are intended to allow the flexibility
necessary to adapt to changed or unusual conditions, both foreseen and
unforeseen, under circumstances which to not ordinarily involve a change of the
principal use of the land or structure permitted. Variances shall not be
granted on the grounds of convenience or reduced or greater profit, and
evidence of variances granted under similar conditions elsewhere is irrelevant.
         A.   Non-numerical variances. In order to grant a variance for a non-
numerical standard, the Board must find that the strict application of the
Zoning Code would cause the property owner to suffer the loss of all
economically viable use of their property. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request that an applicant present a recent and credible appraisal and financial
statements to aid in any such determination.
         B.   Numerical variances. In order to grant a variance for a numerical
standard, the Board must find that the strict application of the Zoning Code
would create practical difficulties for the property owner. Applications for
zoning permits that include numerical variance requests shall include evidence
that sufficient practical difficulties exist to warrant a variance. The Board,
in determining whether the strict application of the Zoning Code would create
practical difficulties for the property owner, shall consider:
            1.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable
return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
            2.   Whether the variance is substantial;
            3.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
            5.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with
knowledge of the zoning restriction;
            6.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be
obviated through some method other than a variance; and
            7.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed, and whether substantial justice would be done by granting
the variance.
      (2)   Conditional Uses.
         A.   In order to grant a conditional use approval, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall consider whether the proposed use:
            1.   Contributes to the essential character of the neighborhood;
            2.   Would likely cause detrimental impact to adjoining properties;
            3.   Aligns with the intent of the adopted comprehensive plan and
other long-range planning publications; and
            4.   May adversely affect the delivery of governmental services
(e.g., water, sewer, garbage).
         B.   In order to grant a conditional use approval, the Board of Zoning
Appeals must find that:
            1.   The proposed use is a conditional use of the district, and the
applicable development standards established in the Zoning Code are met;
            2.   The proposed development is in accord with appropriate plans
for the area; and
            3.   The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing
land use character and physical development potential of the area.
   (g)   Making a Decision. The members of the Board or Commission shall
publicly vote for approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the
application.
      (1)   If the Board or Commission votes to approve the application with
conditions, the conditions must be intended to be in accord with appropriate
plans for the area, and to prevent undesirable effects on adjacent property and
the surrounding area. Such conditions may be a limitation on the extent or
intensity of development, a requirement for additional screening by fence or
landscaping, a change in the method or plan for lighting, control of access or
other conditions of development as may be advantageous to the public.
Recommendations regarding the modification of plans or other appropriate
actions shall be stated with the reasons for each recommendation.
      (2)   Disapproval of an application must include the reasons for such
decision.
      (3)   For voting to occur, quorum must be reached in the Board of Zoning
Appeals or the Commission. If a member abstains from voting on an issue due to
conflict of interest or any other reason, that member shall not contribute to
the quorum.
      (4)   If conditions are to be applied to an application approval, the
members may, prior to a vote, determine which conditions are to be applied for
the intent of clarifying the decision.
      (5)   A vote for approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval may
take place only when a quorum is reached. If a quorum is not reached, the
chairperson shall bench the issue and revisit the issue during the next
meeting.
      (6)   The chairperson shall call a vote and the secretary shall keep
minutes showing the vote of each member upon each issue or, if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact.
      (7)   A decision for approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval
shall be established with the vote of a majority of present members. A tie vote
shall be interpreted as disapproval.
   (h)   Delivery of Decision. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the
public hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Commission shall transmit
its decision to the Building Officer for recording, except that, in the case of
zoning text or map amendments, the Commission shall transmit its decision
directly to Council. If the conditional use approval or variance is granted,
the Building Officer shall issue the building permit, with the appropriate
conditional use approval or variance, to the applicant within fourteen (14)
calendar days of receipt of decision from the Board of Zoning Appeals or the
Commission. Such building permit shall be properly recorded with the County
Auditor. (Ord. 2022-110. Passed 12-12-22.)

Sign Height. The vertical distance measured from the lowest adjacent grade to
the highest point of the sign or sign structure. The overall height of a
freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign
support structure at average grade to the top of the highest attached component
of the sign. In cases in which the average grade cannot reasonably be
determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation
of the grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
point of the crown of a public road or the grade of the land at the primary
entrance to the lowest principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower.

Street Right-of-way. A public or private right-of-way of a width of more than
twenty (20) feet or providing primary access to property(s) abutting such
street right-of-way. A street right-of-way differs from an alley in that it
provides primary access to property and is typically wider. A street right-of-
way differs from other rights-of- way, such as walkways and bikeways, in that
it is typically intended for motor vehicles, although many street rights-of-way
also contain walkways or bikeways adjacent to motorways, and, in such cases,
the walkways or bikeways are considered to be parts of the street rights-of-
way. A street right-of-way differs from a driveway in that a driveway is
contained majorly within a lot intended for purposes other than the movement of
people and vehicles, whereas a street right-of-way is not contained by a lot.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
 
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1303.01 APPLICATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   In order to regulate the erection, construction, repair, alteration and
maintenance of residential dwellings, the Residential Code of Ohio for One-,
Two- and Three-Family Dwellings as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building
standards pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3781.10, shall apply and be enforced within the
City.
(Ord. 2006-30. Passed 5-22-06.)
1303.02 CONFLICT.
   Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this chapter, in all other
cases of conflict between the Residential Code adopted herein and any other
Municipal ordinance or technical code adopted thereby, the more restrictive
provision shall govern.
1303.03 AMENDMENTS.
   The Residential Code adopted herein is modified by the amendment, enactment
or deletion of the following sections as respectively indicated, which
modifications are hereby adopted as set forth here:
   Sec. R-313-Smoke Detectors.
   (a)   “Early fire warning system” means an approved automatic warning system
of one or more devices that detect any of the products of combustion, including
visible or invisible products of combustion, and that produces an audible alarm
in a building for the purpose of notifying the occupants thereof of the
presence of a fire. The primary power for such system may be either an AC
electrical system or a monitored battery. Systems with detectors sensitive to
heat only are not included in this definition for the purposes of this section.
   For the purpose of installation and maintenance only, a system shall be
deemed approved if it is listed by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., and
conforms to the applicable sections of NFIPA Standard No. 72-1999 titled
“National Fire Alarm Code”.
   (b)   The owner of a building of residential occupancy for which no early
fire warning requirements have been imposed by any other applicable municipal
ordinance or state law shall install an operable early fire warning system and
be responsible for assuring that an operable early fire warning system is
present on the premises on or before June 1, 2000. Detectors shall be installed
outside of each separate sleeping area in the immediate vicinity of the
bedrooms in each living unit and on each additional story without sleeping
areas of the living unit, including basements or cellars, and excluding crawl
spaces and unfinished attics. Each detection device shall cause the operation
of an alarm that shall be clearly audible in all bedrooms when all intervening
doors are closed and over all household equipment that may be in operation at
night or in full operation. All detectors shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with NFIPA Standard 72-1999. “National Fire Alarm Code”.
   The owner of any dwelling unit shall not rent or lease or cause to be
occupied any unit without operating approved smoke detectors as required. The
owner/occupant shall verify the presence of the required smoke detectors at the
time of occupancy and make such records available on demand of the fire
official.
   The occupant shall not occupy any living unit without operating approved
smoke detectors as required.
   “Owner” for the purposes of this section shall mean and include the record
owner of the premises as evidenced by the deed records of the Scioto County
Recorder and also the purchaser of the premises under a land contract. If the
premises are being purchased pursuant to a land contract, it shall be the duty
of the purchaser to install the early fire warning system and be responsible
for assuring that an operable early fire warning system is present on the
premises.
   (c)   In any building or residential occupancy in which the owner is
required to have installed an operable early fire warning system, it shall be
the responsibility of the occupant of each residential unit to maintain or have
maintained the early fire warning system in that unit whether or not such
occupant is the owner, as defined in Section R-215(B) of the Building Code. It
shall be the responsibility of the owner to maintain or have maintained any
detectors required in cellars or basements of multi-unit structures except
where the cellar or basement is part of an individual residential unit.
   “Maintain or have maintained” for the purpose of this section shall require
in the case of a battery-operated device the replacement of the battery when
expired, or in the case of an inoperative or missing device or an inoperative
AC electrical system the notification of the building owner and the Portsmouth
Fire Department of the inoperative status of the system or device. All single
station smoke detectors with an exterior test device shall be tested at least
monthly and upon initial occupancy where required. Smoke detectors designed
with a 10 year sealed battery are preferred where battery operated smoke
detectors are utilized.

1305.01 PERMITS.
   (a)   Permit Required. No person shall erect, construct, alter, repair,
equip, remove or demolish a house, building or structure without first filing
with the Building Officer an application in writing and obtaining a permit.
(Ord. 1947-70. Passed 7-16-47.)
   (b)   Fees, Contents of Permit. No permit shall be issued by the Building
Officer until the fees hereinafter prescribed have been paid to him. Each
permit shall show the owner’s name, the location of the premises, the
operations involved and a receipt for the total amount paid. Where the work for
which a permit is required by this Building Code is started, or proceeded with,
prior to obtaining such permit, the fees hereinafter prescribed shall be
doubled. Such fees shall be the fees for the entire project, and the payment of
such double fees shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the
requirements of this Building Code in the execution of the work, nor from any
other penalty prescribed herein.
   (c)   Effective Period. When a permit has been issued, the operation called
for by it shall be for a term of one year from its date for new construction
and six months for alterations and repairs under ten thousand dollars ($10,000)
provided that the work authorized by such permit is begun within thirty days of
the date of the issuance of such permit. All permits will expire after one (1)
year of inactivity which will commence on the first day after the most current
date of inspection. (Ord. 2021-48. Passed 7-26-21.)
   (d)   Application. Applications for permits shall be filed in triplicate
upon appropriate forms furnished by the Building Officer and, for work other
than nonstructural reconstruction, alteration, installation or repair work,
shall be accompanied by plans in duplicate of the proposed work, a statement of
the materials to be used and a lot or plot plan showing the dimensions of the
lot and the location and dimensions of the building or structure. Such lot or
plot plan shall be accompanied by such information as to establish accurately
the legal boundaries and dimensions of the property.
   (e)   Issuance. If the Building Officer approves such application for a
building permit and such application is found to be in accordance with the
provisions of this Building Code and other ordinances of the City, the Building
Officer shall indicate his approval of such application and issue a building
permit for the proposed work as soon as practicable.
   (f)   Moving, Removal, Demolition. No building shall be moved until a permit
has been obtained from the Building Officer or other designated official, and
such official shall not issue a permit if in his judgment the proposed new
location of the building would seriously increase the fire hazard of the
surrounding buildings. No building of frame construction or unprotected metal
construction shall hereafter be moved from without to within the fire limits.
   No permit to remove a building or structure shall be granted until notice of
application thereof has been given to the owners of lots adjoining the lot upon
which such building or structure is to be moved and to the owners of wires or
other impediments, the temporary removal of which will be necessary, and an
opportunity has been given such owners to be heard upon such application; nor
until a bond in an adequate sum has been filed with the Mayor to indemnify and
save harmless the City for damages.
   Demolition permits shall be applied for the same as building permits, but
with no plans needed. However, specifications and diagrams showing methods to
be used for needling or shoring adjacent buildings may be required by the
Building Officer.
   (g)   Approval in Part. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prevent the Building Officer from issuing a permit for the construction of part
of a building or structure before the entire plans and detailed statements of
such building or structure have been submitted or approved, if adequate
information and detailed statements have been presented for the same and have
been found to comply with this Building Code.
   (h)   Conditions.
      (1)   All work performed under a permit issued by the Building Officer
shall conform to the approved application and plans, and approved amendments
thereof.
      (2)   The location of all new construction as shown on the approved plot
diagram, or an approved amendment thereof, shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   No plans, specifications or area of a lot or plot for which a plot
diagram has been filed and has been used as a basis for a permit, when once
approved by the Building Officer or other authorized agent, shall in any way be
changed or altered without the written consent of the Building Officer or his
authorized agent.
      (4)   The permit holder or his agent shall keep posted in a conspicuous
place on the work, the permit, and shall keep it posted until the completion of
the work. The Building Officer may require a certified copy of the approved
plans to be kept on the premises at all times from the commencement of the work
until the completion thereof. The Building Officer shall be given at least
twelve hours' notice of the starting of work under a permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued by the Building Officer under the provisions of
this Building Code shall have his signature affixed thereto. However, he may
authorize a subordinate to affix such signature.
   (i)   Revocation. The Building Officer may revoke a permit or approval
issued under the provisions of this Building Code in case there has been any
false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact in the application
or plans on which the permit or approval was based.
   (j)   Conformity to Zoning Code. No building permit shall be issued for any
building or structure, the construction of which, or other work on which,
violates any of the provisions of the Zoning Code, as now adopted or as
hereafter amended or supplemented.
(Ord. 1947-70. Passed 7-16-47.)
1305.02 AUTHORIZATIONS OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   Authorization Required. No building or structure or part thereof
hereafter erected or constructed shall be occupied until an authorization of
occupancy has been issued by the Building Officer or other authorized agent. No
change of occupancy or use shall be made in a building hereafter erected or
altered that is not consistent with the last issued authorization of occupancy
or that is in violation of the provisions of this Building Code or other
ordinances of the City.
   (b)   Issuance. After any building or structure has been constructed in
accordance with the building permit and the provisions of this Building Code
and other ordinances of the City, it shall be the duty of the Building Officer
to make authorization for occupancy of same, certifying that the building or
structure has been constructed in accordance with the building permit and this
Building Code and other ordinances of the City, and authorizing the
installation and use of utilities and municipal services and the occupancy of
such building or structure.
   (c)   Change of Occupancy. No change of occupancy or use shall be made in a
building hereafter erected or altered that is not consistent with the last
issued authorization of occupancy for such building, unless a permit is
secured. In the case of an existing building, no change in occupancy that would
bring it under some special provision of this Building Code shall be made
unless the Building Officer finds, upon inspection, that such building conforms
substantially to the provisions of law with respect to the proposed new
occupancy and use, and issues an authorization of occupancy therefor.
   The use of a building or premises shall not be deemed to have changed
because of a temporary vacancy or change of ownership or tenancy. But the re-
establishment in a building, after a change of occupancy has been made, of a
prior use that would not have been permitted in a new building of the same type
of construction, is prohibited. No person shall make a change from a
specifically prohibited use to another specifically prohibited use.
(Ord. 1947-70. Passed 7-16-47.)
1305.03 FEES; DISPOSITION.

the same in any measure does not comply with the City or State regulations
pertaining to fire hazards, they shall order the same condemned and removed. On
an order of condemnation from any of such officials or their agents, the
property shall be immediately vacated and shall not be reoccupied until the

1311.04 FIRE LOSS INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86 (C) and (D) whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures: (Ord. 1983-41. Passed 7-10-
00.)
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26 (F)
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief in the aggregate
two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and
each fraction of that amount, of a claim, or if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or
companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate. Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining
after the transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy
terms. The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate
of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that
the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure.
At the request of the owner/insured, the Chief Building Official will inspect
the property after repair/demolition and authorize the Fire Department to
return the deposit to the insured. Any subsequent inspection by the Engineer’s
Office or the Fire Department conducted to confirm compliance will result in a
fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) charged against the insurance
proceeds for each occurrence. (Ord. 2000-78. Passed 7-10-00.)
   (b)   Upon receipt of the proceeds by the City as authorized by this
section, the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in the City Treasury in a
separate sub-fund within Special State and County Fund No. 1700.83, entitled
Special State Fire Loss Insurance, to be used solely as security against the
total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by the City pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 715.261. When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a)
hereof an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of
the named insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City
and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when repairs or
removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed and
the required proof received by the designated officer, if the City has not
incurred any costs for such repairs, removal or securing. If the City has
incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain,
the City of Portsmouth shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured
or insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of
a municipal corporation to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit the municipal
corporation and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some
other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (c)   The Fire Chief is hereby designated as the officer authorized to carry
out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a certified copy of
this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State.
      (Ord. 1983-41. Passed 6-14-83.)
1311.05 OCCUPYING A CONDEMNED STRUCTURE.
   Any occupied structure condemned and placarded by the City of Portsmouth or
State of Ohio pursuant to City Ordinance Section
1311.01,
1311.02 or
1311.03 shall be vacated as ordered by the condemnation official. Any person
who is found to be on the property of a placarded premise, enters a placarded
premise or any owner or other person responsible for the premises who allows
entrance into a placarded premise without a permit issued by the condemning
official shall be subject to the penalties provided in Section
1311.99.
   (a)   The cost of the Condemned Structure Occupancy Permit shall be twenty-
five dollars ($25.00) and be valid for thirty (30) days from the date of
condemnation.
   (b)   Upon the expiration of the original, Condemned Structure Occupancy
Permit an inspection shall be conducted by the condemning official to determine
the progress of correcting the property maintenance issues resulting in the
original condemnation order.
      (1)   If significant progress has been made in correcting the property
maintenance issues, the condemning official may issue an additional thirty-day
permit in order to complete the required corrections. The cost of the permit
shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and be valid for thirty (30) days. The
condemning official may grant additional thirty (30) day permits if the
condemnation official deems significant progress continues to be made in
correcting the property maintenance issues. The additional condemnation permits
shall not exceed a six (6) month time period.
      (2)   Once the six (6) month time period expires or progress ceased to be
made in correcting the property maintenance issues, the case shall be forwarded
to the Nuisance Board for review.
   (c)   Any person or entity denied a Condemned Structure Occupancy Permit may
appeal to the Nuisance Board per the procedures set forth in Section
1313.05.
      (Ord. 2024-55. Passed 9-23-24.)
1311.06 BOARDING OF VACANT OR CONDEMNED STRUCTURES.
   (a)   No person being the owner, lessee or agent of any vacant or condemned
property located within the City shall allow a vacant dwelling(s) or building
(s) to remain open or unsecured. This includes the principal dwelling, storage
building(s) or detached garage(s).
   (b)   If the owner, lessee or agent of the vacant or condemned property
fails to secure the vacant dwelling(s) or building(s) as ordered to do so, the
City Manager or his or her authorized agent shall secure the dwelling(s) or
building(s) at a cost (per occurrence) as follows:
      (1)   1-5 boards $250
      (2)   5-10 boards $500
      (3)   Greater than 10 boards $1,000
   (c)   Only one notice per calendar year is required for a lot or parcel.
This notice may include notification during a public meeting. If, after a
notice has been given or served in accordance with this section, the City
Manger or his or her designated agent determines that a subsequent violation
has occurred, the City may proceed with the remedy set forth in subsection (b)
hereof without further notice.
(Ord. 2024-38. Passed 7-8-24.)
1311.99 PENALTY.
   Any owner or his agent duly authorized to have supervision over any property
of the owner, or any occupant of the buildings, who refuses to obey the orders
of any of the officials heretofore designated or their agents, or who delays
unreasonably in compliance therewith is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

1315.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.     Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City of Portsmouth, State of Ohio does ordain as
follows.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the City of Portsmouth are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public
health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purposes,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas. (Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-98.)

   (p)   "Manufactured home subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels)
of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for sale. This
definition shall exclude any manufactured home park as defined in Section
3733.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, for which the Public Health Council has
exclusive rule making power.
   (q)   "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (r)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (s)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such .as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (v)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)    Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure”; or
      (3)    Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   (w)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of this chapter
consistent with the variance conditions herein. (Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-
98.)
1315.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Portsmouth
as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including any
additional flood hazard areas annexed by the City that are not identified on
the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-98.)
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “Flood Insurance Study
Scioto County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas” dated April 18, 2011. This study,
with accompanying “Flood Insurance Rate Map Scioto County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas” dated April 18, 2011, and any revisions thereto, are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be part of this chapter.
(Ord. 2010-74. Passed 12-27-10.)
   (c)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless
specifically exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1315.04(b), Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and other ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Portsmouth, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord.
1998-139. Passed 9-28-98.)
1315.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
obtained from the Building Officer before construction or development begins
within any area of special flood hazard established in Section
1315.03(b), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms furnished by the
Building Officer and may include, but not be limited to: site specific
topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and
elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
The following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1315.05(b)(2) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1315.05(b)(2) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
   (b)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit. An application for a
development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than $1,000. Any
proposed action exempt from filing for a development permit is also exempt from
the standards of this chapter.
   (c)   Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator. The Building
Officer is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by
granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
   (d)    Duties and Responsibilities of the Building Officer. The duties and
responsibilities of the Building Officer shall include but are not limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.  
         A.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by
the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1315.05(c)(1) is met.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1315.03(b), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, are
designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these
areas, the Building Officer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal state, or other
source, including data obtained under Section
1315.05(b)(6), Subdivisions and Large Developments, in order to administer
Section
1315.05(b)(1), Specific Standards, Residential Construction;
1315.05(b)(2), Specific Standards, Nonresidential Construction; and
1315.05(c) Floodways.
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data,
the following provisions apply:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection (a)(3) hereof.
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.  
         A.   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation required in subsection (a)(3)
hereof that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of
said watercourse will not be diminished.
         C.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
subsection (e), Variance Procedure.
   (e)   Variance Procedure.   
      (1)   Appeal Board.
         A.   The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the City of
Portsmouth, Ohio shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter.
         B.   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the Building Officer in the enforcement or administration of this
chapter.
         C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals or
any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Scioto County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         D.   In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         E.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (e)(1)D. hereof
and the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
         F.   The Building Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
       (2)   Conditions for variances.  
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         C.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items 1. to 11. in subsection (e)(1)D.
hereof have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         D.    Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         E.    Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (e)(1)D. hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         F.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
            (Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-98.)

         B.   These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are
either:
            1.   Located on sites for 180 days or more, or
            2.   Are not fully licensed and ready for highway use.
      (5)   Enclosures below the lowest floor. The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns, or
posts. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must:
         A.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or,
         B.   Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
openings provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
      (6)   Subdivisions and large developments. In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1315.03(b), Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, or
Section
1315.04(d)(2), Use of Other Base Flood Elevation Data, the following standards
apply to all subdivision proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions,
and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres
(whichever is less):
         A.   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed
in accordance with standard engineering practices;
         B.   If subsection (b)(6)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (a), General Standards, and subsection (b),
Specific Standards.
   (c)   Floodways.  
      (1)   Areas with floodways. The Flood Insurance Study referenced in
Section
1315.03(b) identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1315.04(d)(2). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential. The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   If subsection (c)(1)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (b), Specific Standards.
         C.   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such request must be submitted by
the Building Officer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet
the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (2)   Areas without floodways. In all areas of special flood hazard where
FEMA has provided base flood elevation data as set forth in Section
1315.03(b), but FEMA has not delineated a floodway, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
         B.   If subsection (c)(2)A. hereof is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Section
1315.05, Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction. (Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-
98.)
1315.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the third degree. Any person
who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Portsmouth. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Portsmouth from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Portsmouth shall
prosecute any violation of this chapter in accordance with the penalties stated
herein. (Ord. 1998-139. Passed 9-28-98.)

1317.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (a)   In recognition of the need for legislation creating an institution
that will provide for the protection and enhancement of the distinctive
character of the historic preservation districts of Portsmouth and for the
objective study of alternatives to the proposed alteration or demolition of
certain notable structures, works of art, objects or areas within the City,
Council hereby establishes the City Designated Preservation Districts.
   (b)   The "Historic District Design Guidelines: Portsmouth, Ohio," is hereby
adopted by the City and incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein,
save and except such portions as may be hereinafter amended, modified or
deleted.
(Ord. 1984-74. Passed 10-9-84.)
1317.02 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC POLICY AND PURPOSE.
   Council being mindful, during the national bicentennial, of the proud
history of this City, and of the importance of a measure of beauty in the
everyday lives of the residents hereby declares as a matter of public policy
that the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation and overall aesthetic
improvement of certain areas, structures, objects and works of art within the
City are matters of public necessity involving the health, safety, prosperity
and welfare of the people. The purpose of this chapter is to:
   (a)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of historic
preservation districts by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the
various period structures within them which together create a rare panorama of
Americana, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within the districts that
would be incompatible with this established character;
   (b)   Protect, and compliment the singular historic and architectural
quality of the Boneyfiddle District which is essentially devoid of a random
mixture of older and contemporary structures and their modifications;

      (Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.08 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF BUILDING, DEMOLITION AND SIGN PERMITS.
   No permit shall be issued by the Building Officer, Division of Building
Inspection, Department of Engineering, for the construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any structure, work of art, object or area within a
preservation district or for any listed property except in cases coming under
Section
1317.11, unless the application for such permit is approved by the Review Board
through the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness in the manner
prescribed herein. No sign permit shall be issued by the Building Officer or
through otherwise established procedures for any sign to be erected or placed
within a preservation district or for any sign to be attached to or erected
upon any listed property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been
issued for that sign in the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.09 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   The procedure for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness is
as follows: When the owner or user of a property within a preservation district
or the owner or user of an otherwise listed property desires to make any
environmental change, including the construction, reconstruction, demolition or
alteration of a property or object or the erection of a sign he shall first
obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the Design Review Board. A
certificate of appropriateness shall also be obtained for landscaping as
prescribed herein and for proposed tree removal within a preservation district.
A certificate of appropriateness shall not be required for removal by the City
of trees within street or alley rights of way.
   (b)   If the proposed work requires a building permit or sign permit, the
owner or user shall file an application through the Building Officer who then
refers the matter to the Review Board. If the change, sign or proposed
landscaping is not incompatible with and does not adversely affect any
historic, architectural or environmental feature of the property or physically
related properties which are also within a preservation district or otherwise
listed and does not violate the spirit and purpose of this chapter, then the
Review Board shall issue a certificate of appropriateness and the owner or user
may proceed.
   (c)   If the change, sign or landscaping would have an adverse effect on
properties subject to the provisions of this chapter or be otherwise
incompatible or inappropriate to the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the
Review Board shall not issue a certificate of appropriateness and shall make
every effort for a period not to exceed six weeks, by working with the
applicant, to develop a proposal for such change, sign or landscaping that will
be compatible with the terms of this chapter so that a certificate of
appropriateness can be issued by the Board. Any time during this period the
Board may refer the application to the Planning Commission, or, if no
satisfactory alternative has been worked out by the end of the six-week period,
then the Review Board shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission
together with the Board's recommendations concerning the application. The owner
or user may be required to delay his proposed construction, reconstruction or
alteration for up to one year by the Planning Commission. If the application
involves demolition, the owner or user may be required to delay his work for up
to two years by the Planning Commission. Sign applications may be permanently
denied by the Planning Commission.
   (d)   In the case of an inappropriate change, sign or landscaping proposal
the Review Board shall, during this waiting period, attempt to work out an
alternative plan with the owner or user or his representative that is
acceptable to all parties. In the case of a proposed demolition, the Review
Board shall attempt to find practicable alternatives to demolition.
   (e)   If the Review Board is unable to work out an alternative plan that
conforms to the spirit and purpose of this chapter and the waiting period
expires, the owner or user, if still desiring to execute his proposal, shall
make application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals,
functioning under its own and otherwise prescribed rules of procedure, shall
consider the positions of the owner or user and the Design Review Board and may
approve or deny the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)   In the event the certificate is denied by the Zoning Board of Appeals,
the owner or user may appeal to Council. He may not proceed until Council has
made a determination on the matter. The Council, functioning under its own
rules of procedure, shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Design Review Board, the Zoning Board of Appeals, the
owner or user, the views expressed by persons participating in public hearings
which Council may hold, together with the recommendations of the Planning
Commission. Upon its conclusion, Council shall determine whether a certificate
of appropriateness shall be issued. No further appeal shall be initiated upon
denial by Council for twelve months. After twelve months the process of
application and appeal may be repeated.
   (g)   Where the position of the Zoning Board of Appeals is overruled by
Council, a certificate of appropriateness shall automatically issue upon such
action.
   (h)   Within thirty days after the filing of an application for a
certificate of appropriateness, the Review Board shall decide whether the
proposed change, sign or landscaping is appropriate. The Review Board is
obligated to act as quickly as possible on all applications so as to cause as
little inconvenience to the owner or user as is possible and shall attempt,
where the proposed change, sign or landscaping is inappropriate, to keep the
waiting period as brief as it may be. Where a recommendation of disapproval is
made to the Planning Commission, the reasons shall be set forth in writing.
(Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.10 EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   In considering the appropriateness of any environmental changes,
including signs and landscaping, the Review Board shall take into account, in
addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural style
and general design, arrangement, texture, material and color of the proposed
change as they relate to the property in its present condition and shall also
consider the relation thereof to the same or related factors in other
properties, objects and areas in the immediate vicinity.
   (b)   Attention shall be taken to avoid the environmentally harmful effect
often created by the clash of undisguised contemporary materials with those of
older origin, such as aluminum or other metals, plastic, fiberglass and glass
improperly used with brick, stone, masonry and wood.
   (c)   The Review Board shall refer to the criteria and guidelines for
architectural, sign and design review established by the Board pursuant to the
terms of this chapter.
   (d)   The Review Board shall consider the advice of those consultants whose
opinion is sought by the Board with respect to any application for a
certificate of appropriateness.
(Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.11 EXCLUSIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property, area or object within a preservation
district or otherwise listed under the provisions of this chapter, provided
such work involves no change in material, design, texture, color or outer
appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any
environmental change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition of any feature which in the view of the proper authority acting
lawfully is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous
condition. However, no demolition permit shall issue except upon the
certification of a registered professional engineer that the structure of a
building is unsound or would need major reinforcement to be brought under
Building Code structural requirements, considering a use that the building
would reasonably lend itself to.
(Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)

City.
      (Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.13 PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING PRESERVATION DISTRICTS AND LISTING
PROPERTIES.
   (a)   When a proposal to establish an historical district or to list an
individual property, structure, object or work of art for protection is
received by the Design Review Board or initiated by the Design Review Board,
the owner or owners shall be notified by the Design Review Board and the
owner's written consent obtained where possible.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall consider the proposal in terms of the

recommendations of the Design Review Board and the Planning Commission in
making its determination with respect to the proposed designation of any areas,
places, buildings, structures, works of art and other similar objects as listed
property. Council may, in its discretion, hold public hearings on any such
proposed designation. Upon its conclusion, Council may designate such areas,
places, buildings, structures, works of art and other similar objects as listed
properties.
   (e)   After the decision by Council, the Review Board shall notify any owner
or any person having a legal or equitable interest in such property of the
decision.
(Ord. 1976-134. Passed 10-26-76.)
1317.99 PENALTY.

maintenance of all structures and dwellings; and fixing penalties for
violation.
(Ord. 2004-11. Passed 2-23-04.)
1319.02 OCCUPIED OR VACANT STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   All occupied or vacant structures and premises thereof or vacant land shall

(Ord. 2024-11. Pased 3-25-24.)
1319.04 GRADING AND DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Objective. It shall be the objective of grading regulations to provide
grading which will divert surface water away from buildings and dispose of such
water without harmful effects on neighboring property, to preserve desirable
site features and to provide grades and gradients for safe and convenient
access to and around buildings and lots for their normal use and maintenance.
The final grade at the building shall not be closer than eight inches to the
wood or other corrodible siding or exterior trim.
   (b)   Surface Drainage. Positive drainage shall be provided for each lot or
plot by proper draining so that a nuisance will not be created. Catch basins or
properly connected under-drains shall be installed, or other approved
provisions made where water may pocket, to preclude the accumulation of surface
water. Regrading shall be done so that existing natural ground drainage of the
surrounding area is not impeded.
   The Building Official may adopt rules or plans for the drainage of lots or
plots, which rules or plans shall be followed by the owner unless permission
for deviation is given by the Nuisance Board of Appeals. When a lot or plot is
graded to a higher or lower level than the natural grade on an adjacent
property, the owner of such lot or plot shall provide suitable slopes or
retaining walls or other protection approved by the Building Official on his
own property to preserve the natural slope or surface elevation of such
adjacent property.
   (c)   Footing Drains. When a floor is below the adjoining ground and subsoil
conditions are such as to permit groundwater to accumulate adjacent to the
foundation, footing drains shall be installed alongside the outside face of the
base of the foundation. Such drains shall be not less than four-inch diameter
pipe of a type and construction to intercept and carry groundwater without
permitting the infiltration of soil into the pipe. Footing drains shall have a
continuous slope of not less than one-sixteenth inch per foot, discharging into
the building storm sewer or other outlet approved by the Building Official.
   (d)   Backfill Over Footing Drains. The backfill over footing drains shall
be pervious material of the type, size and gradation required for the
particular type of drain construction being used and shall be carried up at
least eight inches over drain tile but not closer than twelve inches of the
established surface grade. The top twelve inches of the backfill shall consist
of six inches of an impervious (clay) soil, topped with six inches of a clay
topsoil if the surface is to be covered with lawn or shrubs. If the surface
adjacent to the foundation wall is to be paved or have some similar treatment,
then the backfill near the top may be a suitable base for such construction.
   (e)   Roof and Yard Drainage. Unless otherwise specifically approved by the
Building Official, roof drainage shall be handled by suitable collectors and
downspouts which shall discharge into a sealed-jointed storm drain of not less
than four-inch diameter with a slope of one-fourth inch or more per foot. Where
a storm sewer or other storm drainage outlet is not available, downspouts may
discharge onto splash blocks or into other devices provided that no excess
water will flow onto adjoining property or over sidewalks. The storm drain
outlet, carrying roof water or yard drainage shall be not less than six-inch
diameter, and shall not connect to the footing drain, but may intercept and
receive the outlet of the footing drain by a wye connection above the spring
line. Connection of any pipe, carrying roof water or yard drainage to a
sanitary sewer is prohibited.
(Ord. 1992-61. Passed 6-22-92.)
1319.05 LOADING AREAS.
   All loading areas, automobile service stations and drive-in food
establishments shall be paved with bituminous, concrete or equivalent surfacing
and shall be free from dirt and other litter and kept in good repair. When

dwellings nearby.

of major disassembly or disrepair, nor shall it be in the process of being
stripped or dismantled. A vehicle shall not at any time undergo major overhaul.
   (b)   Nothing in this section shall be applicable to either historical
vehicles or to collector's vehicles. As used in this section, "historical
vehicle" means any motor vehicle which is over twenty-five years old, and which
is owned solely as a collector's item and for participation in club activities,
exhibitions, tours, parades and similar uses, but in no event to be used for

1325.12    Penalties.

1325.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of the establishment of a Vacant Building Enforcement
Program is to regulate the maintenance of properties which are in the
foreclosure process, abandoned or vacant as it has been established that
structures which are left vacant for extended periods of time have been shown
to breed crime, pose public safety risks, and reduce property values and the
economic viability of the community in which they are found. This program is
intended to reduce and prevent neighborhood blight, to avoid the creation and
maintenance of public nuisances, to ameliorate conditions that threaten the
public, safety and welfare, to promote neighborhood safety and occupancy by
preserving the condition and appearance of residential properties and the worth
and activity of commercial and industrial properties, and to maintain property
values and assessments. This program further establishes a means of identifying
the owner and/or responsible entities of vacant and/or abandoned properties
within the corporate limits of the City of Portsmouth; to determine the
responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and structures; to provide
incentives for the rehabilitation and productive use of vacant buildings; to
provide for the registration and certain maintenance requirements for vacant
and/or abandon properties; and to otherwise shift the cost or burden of the
existence of vacant residential and commercial structures from the general
citizenry to the owners of the buildings.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to waive, relieve, or
otherwise excuse an owner of property from compliance with all applicable
codes, ordinances, statutes or laws and the owner shall at all times remain
responsible and liable therefore. Further, nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent the enforcement of other provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Portsmouth or the Ohio Revised Code and nothing herein shall be
construed to relieve an owner or interested party from duties imposed pursuant
to any regulatory code, ordinance, statute, or law of the City of Portsmouth or

(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.02  APPLICABILITY.
   This Vacant Building Enforcement Program shall be applicable to all
residential, commercial and industrial structures located within the
municipality of the City of Portsmouth.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.03  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for purposes
of this chapter, have the meanings indicated herein.
   (a)   "Abandoned" means a structure that is unoccupied as the result of the
relinquishment of possession or control by an owner or other person with the
right of possession or control of the structure, a mortgagor or the mortgagor's
assigns whether or not the mortgagor or mortgagor's assigns have relinquished
equity and title. A structure may be deemed abandoned when there is evidence of
conditions, taken separately or as a whole, that would lead a reasonable person
to conclude that the property was abandoned, including, but not limited to,
evidence of overgrown or dead vegetation, accumulation of newspapers,
circulars, flyers, mail, past due utility notices, or other means of notice by
publication, the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris, absence of
windows or window treatments, absence of furnishings and personal items,
statements of neighbors, delivery agents or similarly situated persons that the
property is abandoned.
   (b)   "Inspector" means a person employed by or under contract to the City
of Portsmouth to perform inspections, to determine compliance with codes and to
order corrective measures and/or initiate administrative, civil or criminal
proceedings.
   (c)   "Vacant" means a structure that is not lawfully occupied or that
otherwise qualifies as "abandoned" under this chapter. Multi- family
residential structures shall be considered vacant when more than one-half of
the units and more than one-half of the available space are not currently
lawfully occupied by a tenant or tenants or that otherwise qualifies as
"abandoned" under this chapter. Commercial structures shall be considered
vacant when all commercial activity has ceased at the site or that otherwise
qualifies as "abandoned" herein. Multi-tenant commercial structures shall be
considered vacant when substantially all of the units are not lawfully occupied
or engaged in commercial activity, or that otherwise qualifies as "abandoned"
herein. Industrial structures shall be considered abandoned when all industrial
manufacturing activity has ceased at the site or that otherwise qualifies as
"abandoned" as herein defined. Multi-tenant industrial structures shall be
considered vacant when substantially all of the units are not lawfully occupied
or engaged in industrial or manufacturing activity, or that otherwise qualifies
as "abandoned" herein. In determining whether a structure is vacant, it is also
relevant to consider, among other factors, the percentage of the overall square
footage of
       the building or floor not in use to the occupied space; the condition
and value of any items in the structure and the presence of rental or for sale
signs on the property. A property that is temporarily unoccupied and is in the
process of being renovated under proper and unexpired permit shall not be
considered vacant. Further, a property that is listed for sale with a licensed
relator under a fully executed listing agreement shall not be considered vacant
for the first six months of the listing agreement under which the property was
first listed for sale. Such property shall be considered vacant for purposes of
this chapter upon the expiration of the first six-month period for which it is
first listed for sale or upon a subsequent re-listing with the same or a
different licensed relator. Unoccupied property listed as "for sale by owner"
shall be considered vacant for purposes of this chapter.
   (d)   "Owner" means the registered owner of a property, any person that
holds legal or equitable title to the property, is a mortgagee, a vendee-in-
possession, assignee of rents, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other
person, firm or corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a
property. The owner of a property in default or for which a foreclosure action
is pending or for which a judgment in foreclosure has been issued shall include
the mortgagee, the successor and interest to the mortgagee, the lender or
servicing agent and any agent acting for the mortgagee, its successors, or a
lender or servicing company. Under this definition, there may be more than one
"owner" of a property for purposes of this chapter.
   (e)   "Secure" means a covering shall be placed over all doors and windows
which are within fifteen feet of the exterior grade, consisting of one-half
inch thick plywood attached to the framing of all such doors and windows by
'wood screws of a minimum length of one and half inches, placed twelve inches
on center. Such plywood shall be painted with a minimum of two coats of oil-
based exterior paint. In order to be considered secure, a property must also be
in compliance with all requirements of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Portsmouth and the City Building Code. (Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.04  DUTIES OF OWNER.
   (a)   The owner of any structure that has become vacant as defined above
shall, within ninety (90) days after the structure first becomes vacant, within
ninety days of receiving notice that a structure is vacant, or within ninety
days after the effective date of this chapter, whichever is later, file a
registration statement for each such structure with the City Engineer or his
designee on forms provided for such purposes. Any owner of a property which
files a foreclosure action against such property, or for which a foreclosure
action is pending, or a Judgment of Foreclosure has been issued shall, in
addition to all other requirements of this section, provide a cash bond
acceptable to the City Engineer or his designee, in the sum of not less than
ten thousand dollars ($10,000), to secure the continued maintenance of the
property throughout its vacancy and remunerate the City for any expenses
incurred in inspecting, securing, repairing, and/or making such buildings safe
by any legal means including, but not limited to, demolition. A portion of said
bond in an amount to be determined by the City Engineer shall be retained by
the City as an administrative fee to fund an account for expenses incurred in
inspecting, securing, repairing and/or making said building and other buildings
which are involved in the foreclosure process or vacant safe.
   (b)   The owner, agent, lessee, party in control, or mortgagee in
foreclosure of any vacant building shall agree to grant unrestricted access to
the vacant building after receiving forty-eight-hour notice from the City of
Portsmouth for inspections and appraisals as necessary.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.05  VACANT BUILDING REGISTRATION.
   (a)   The owner, agent, lessee, or party in control of any vacant building,
or a mortgagee that has filed a foreclosure action that is currently pending
regarding any vacant building shall register the building with the office of
the City Engineer and maintain the registration up to date. Further, upon
registration, a general interior and exterior inspection of the building shall

security, maintenance and marketing of the property. By designating an
authorized agent under the provisions of this section, the owner is consenting
to the service of any and all notices required or allowed under this chapter
upon said agent;
      (5)   The names and addresses of all known lien holders and all other
parties known or believed upon information to have a claim of an ownership
interest in the building.
   (c)   The registration shall remain valid for twelve months from the date of
issuance. The owner, agent, lessee or party in control, or mortgagee in
foreclosure, shall renew the registration upon expiration for as long as the
property remains vacant and shall pay an annual registration fee to the City.
   (d)   An owner who fails to register a vacant structure under the provisions
of this chapter shall further be deemed to consent to receive, by posting at
this structure, any and all notices of code violations and all process in an
administrative proceeding brought to enforce code provisions concerning the
structure and premises.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.06 VACANT BUILDING PLAN.
   (a)   The owner, agent, lessee or party in control of any vacant building,
or a mortgagee that has filed a foreclosure action that is currently pending
regarding any vacant building shall submit a vacant building plan which must
meet the approval of the City Engineer or his designee. The plan, at a minimum,
must contain one of the following:
      (1)   If the building is to be demolished, a demolition plan indicating
the proposed time frame for demolition which includes starting within thirty
days of acceptance of the proposed demolition time line and does not exceed one
year in accordance with the City and Ohio Building Codes; or
      (2)   If the building is to remain vacant, a plan for ensuring the
building is secured in accordance with all applicable building and fire codes
along with the procedure that will be used to maintain the property, and a
statement of the reasons why the building will be left vacant (e.g., building
is for sale, etc.); or
      (3)   If the building is to be returned to appropriate occupancy or use,
rehabilitation plans for the building and grounds. The rehabilitation plan

the City Engineer grants an extension upon receipt of a written statement from
the owner detailing the reasons for the extension. Any repairs, improvements or
alterations to the property must comply with any applicable zoning, housing,
historic preservation, or building codes, and the property must be secured
during the rehabilitation.
   (b)   If the plan or time table for the vacant building is revised in any
way, the revision(s) must be in writing and must meet the approval of the City
Engineer or his designee.
   (c)   Failure of the owner or any subsequent owner to maintain the building
and premises that result in remedial action taken by the City shall be grounds

penalties provided by the law or this Chapter.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.07 NEW OWNER.

Engineer within thirty days of any transfer of an ownership interest in a

previous owner until any proposed changes are submitted and meet the approval
of the City or his designee.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.08  EXEMPTIONS.

circumstances as long as the property is kept in safe, secure and habitable
condition in the owner's absence:

or act of God; provided clean up, repair or demolition is initiated within
ninety days from the date of the fire or other damaging event.

(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.09 FEES.
   The fees described in this section are established in order to defray the
cost to the city government and community as a whole related to the health,
safety and economic impacts of structures which remain vacant for long periods
of time, including but not limited to, administrative costs for registering and
processing the vacant building owner registration form and for the costs
incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The fees are also
structured in order to provide appropriate incentives for owners of vacant
buildings to care for them properly, seek to fill them, and in appropriate
cases, demolish them. The annually increased fee amounts are intended to absorb
the costs incurred by the City for demolition and hazard abatement of or
repairs to vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal administrative
costs stated above.
   (a)   The owner of a vacant residential or multi-residential building shall
pay an annual fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the first year the
building remains vacant. For every consecutive year that the building remains
vacant, the annual fee will be assessed at double the previous year's fee
amount for a maximum annual fee equaling the five-year fee of three thousand
two hundred dollars ($3,200.00) to be used for the fifth and for all
consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (b)   The owner of a vacant commercial or industrial building (including
multi-tenant buildings) shall pay an annual fee of four hundred dollars
($400.00) for the first year that the building remains vacant. For every
consecutive year that the building remains vacant, the annual fee will be
assessed at double the previous year's fee amount for a maximum annual fee
equaling the five-year fee of six thousand four hundred dollars ($6,400.00) to
be used for the fifth and for all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (c)   The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the owner successfully restores the building to occupancy or
demolishes it in accordance with the applicable law during the first year
following registration, the fee shall be refunded, less an administrative
charge equal to five percent of the amount refunded. In each subsequent year,
if the registration is renewed in a timely fashion, there have been no
violations associated with the property in the previous year, and the
reinspection reveals no significant housing, building or fire code violations,
one half of the previous year's registration fee shall be refunded to the
owner, less an administrative charge equal to five percent of the amount
refunded.
   (d)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption.
   (e)   All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer
of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed on the
property to collect delinquent fees.
   (f)   Absent a showing of good cause, if a building is not registered within
the time frame required, or the registration is not renewed within thirty days
after the expiration of one year from the date of the previous registration, a
penalty shall be paid in addition to the annual registration fee. The penalty
shall be equal to one-half of the current annual fee or one thousand dollars
($1,000), whichever is less.
      (Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.10 CORRECTION OF VIOLATIONS.
   Any violations found upon inspection of the premises shall be corrected
prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Violations that cannot be
corrected due to seasonal conditions shall not preclude the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy, provided that issuance of such certificate shall be
upon written acknowledgment of all violations and an agreement to correct all
violations within six months of the inspection date. In addition, written
notice must be received by the City that the funds are being held in an escrow
account in a sufficient amount to correct all violations, but in no case less
than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Such account shall be held by an
independent escrow agent and shall be closed only upon written notice by the
City Engineer or his designee. (Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.11  CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   At the request of the owner of property or his/her agent, the City shall
issue a letter or other written document signed and dated by the City Engineer
or his designee stating that all violations listed on a Certificate of
Inspection have been completed to the City's satisfaction, and the property
eligible for occupancy. No vacant building can be occupied until this
Certificate of Occupancy is obtained.
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.12 PENALTIES.
   (a)   Notwithstanding any other language in this chapter and unless
otherwise specified, any person who violates any provision of this chapter or
of the rules and regulations issued herein and fails to maintain the property
according to the codes shall be guilty of a fourth-degree misdemeanor and upon
conviction, shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for each
offense. Every day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate and
distinct offense.
   (b)   Unpaid registration fees and fines shall be an assessment on the
property enforceable in the same manner as assessments for delinquent property
taxes.
   (c)   The owner of any vacant structure that fails to file a registration
statement for each such structure within the time frames established herein or
who fails to update a change in registration information within the time frames
established shall be subject to a fifty dollar ($50.00) per day administrative
penalty with a maximum penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000).
(Ord. 2021-55. Passed 8-23-21.)
1325.13  APPEALS.
   Any owner who is served a notice of vacant property registration may come
within ten calendar days of receipt of such notice, apply for an exemption or
appeal the findings and process an appeal in accordance with Ohio Revised Code
§2506.01 et. seq.

the Board of Health, provided the request for such hearing is made within seven
(7) days after the suspension of the permit. The tenant will be allowed to
remain in the rental property during the appeal, unless the conditions were of

Therefore, all persons owning or operating any process, fuel-burning, or
control equipment pertaining thereto, which may be a source of air pollutants,
may be required to register and cooperate fully and without reservation with
the Board, supplying required information for a comprehensive emission
inventory.
   (b)   The above information shall include the form and dimensions of the
process, fuel- burning, refuse-burning, or control equipment, including the
means provided for admitting the air for combustion process; the character of
the fuel to be used; the maximum quantity of such fuel to be burned per hour;
the kind and amount of raw materials processed; the expected air pollutant
emission rate; the operating requirements; the use made of such process, fuel-
burning, refuse- burning, or control equipment; pollutant concentration, gas
volume, and gas temperature at the emission point; physical characteristics;
the location and elevation of the emission point relative to nearby structure,
window opening, etc.; and any other reasonable and pertinent information, that
may be required by the Board.
   (c)   The Board shall supply necessary forms on which such data will be
recorded and submitted to the Board. Registration shall be valid for a period
of two years from the date of registration. At the end of that time the source
must again be registered and up to date information on the source’s emissions
as the Board shall require must be submitted to the Board.

1379.01 SAMPLING AND TESTING.
   (a)   The Commissioner of Air Pollution Control is hereby authorized to
conduct or cause to be conducted, any test or tests of any new or existing
process, fuel-burning, refuse- burning, or control equipment the operation of
which in his judgment may result in emissions in excess of the limitations
contained in Chapter
1377 or when the emissions from any such equipment may exceed the limits of
emissions provided for herein.
   (b)   All tests shall be conducted in a manner determined by the
Commissioner and a complete detailed test report of such test or tests shall be
submitted to him.
   When tests are taken by the owner or independent testers employed by the
owner, the Commissioner shall require that said tests be conducted by reputable
qualified personnel and shall stipulate that a qualified representative or
representatives of the Portsmouth Air Pollution Control be present during the
conduction of such tests. The Commissioner may stipulate a reasonable time
limit for the completion of such test and the submission of test reports.
   (c)   Nothing in this section concerning tests conducted by and paid for by
any person or his authorized agent shall be deemed to abridge the right of the
Commissioner or his representative to conduct separate or additional tests of
any process, fuel-burning, refuse-burning, or control equipment on behalf of
the City, whether or not such tests related to emissions controlled by specific
limitations under this Code.
(Ord. 1970-69. Passed 7-28-70.)
1379.02 TEST FACILITIES AND ACCESS.
   (a)   It will be the responsibility of the owner or operator of the
equipment tested to provide, at his expense, utilities, facilities and
reasonable and necessary openings in the system or stack, and safe and easy
access thereto, to permit samples and measures to be taken. All new sources of
air contaminants created after the effective date of this section may be
required by the Commissioner of Air Pollution Control to provide utilities,
facilities and adequate openings in the system or stack and safe and each
access thereto, to permit measures and samples to be taken.
   (b)   When any process equipment, fuel-burning equipment or refuse-burning
equipment has caused an air pollution nuisance as determined by the
Commissioner or has violated a provision of this Code, the Commissioner may at
his discretion require that said equipment be equipped with an air contaminant
recording device with an audible alarm set so as to become activated upon
reaching prohibited levels of emission, which device shall be maintained in
proper operating conditions at all times. Records from such recording device
shall be made available to the Commissioner for periods up to one year.
(Ord. 1970-69. Passed 7-28-70.)
1379.03 EMISSION TEST METHODS.
   Emission tests shall be undertaken by generally recognized standards or
methods of measurement. Methods found in the A.S.M.E Test Code for Determining
Dust Concentrations in Gas Streams P.T.C. 27-1957, the Los Angeles County
Source Testing Manual or recommended procedures of the National Air Pollution
Administration shall be used but these may be modified or adjusted by the
Commissioner of Air Pollution Control to suit specific sampling conditions or
needs based upon good practice, judgment and experience. Updating of these
standards and modifications thereof shall be published in rules and regulations
of the Commissioner of Air Pollution Control. (Ord. 1970-69. Passed 7-28-70.)
1379.04 TESTS COSTS.
   (a)   If emission tests conducted as a result of the action of the
Commissioner of Air Pollution Control substantiate that a violation exists, the
person or persons responsible for the violation shall be responsible for paying
all attendant costs for conducting said tests. If said tests do not show that a
violation exists, then the City shall be responsible for paying all costs for
conducting said test. In no event shall the City assume costs of providing
facilities, utilities and access for such testing.
   (b)   When the person responsible elects to conduct his own stack emission
tests, then the person so electing shall pay for the test or tests
notwithstanding other provisions of this section, and irrespective of the
result.
   (c)   The costs of emission tests required by the Commissioner on newly
installed equipment for the issuance of the initial permit to install and the
issuance of the initial certificate of operation shall not be at the expense of
the City regardless of the results. The tests for existing sources relating to
contaminants not specifically controlled by this Code shall be at the expense
of the City except for facilities, utilities and access required to be provided
by Section
1379.02.

1381.01 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Any person who owns or is in control of any plant, building,
structure, process or equipment may apply to the Appeals Board for a variance
from provisions of this Code. The Appeals Board may grant such variance upon
satisfactory proof by the applicant if it finds that:
      (1)   The emissions occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger or
will not threaten to endanger human health or safety.
      (2)   Compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is
sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the
public.
   (b)   No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section except after
public hearing on due notice and until the Appeals Board has considered the
relative interests of the applicant and other owners of property likely to be
affected by the discharges, and the general public.
   (c)   Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the
requirements of subsection (a) hereof and for time periods and under conditions
consistent with the reasons thereof, and with the following limitations:
      (1)   If the variance is granted on the grounds that there is no
practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or
control of the air pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary
means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and
subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the Appeals
Board may prescribe.
      (2)   If the variance is granted on the grounds that compliance with the
particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will
necessitate the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must
be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period, not to
exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the Appeals Board is requisite
for the taking of the necessary measures. A variance granted on the grounds
specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an
expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable.
      (3)   If the variance is granted on the grounds that it is justified to
relieve or prevent hardship of any kind other than provided for in terms of
subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) hereof, it shall be for not more than one year.
   (d)   Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms
and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting
of a variance. If complaint is made to the Air Pollution Control Officer or to
the Commissioner on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be
granted, unless, following public hearing on the complaint, the Appeals Board
finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on
application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty days
prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an
application for renewal, the Commissioner of Air Pollution Control shall give
public notice of such application in accordance with rules and regulations of
the Board.
   (e)   A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder
thereof but shall be in the discretion of the Appeals Board. However, any
person adversely affected by a variance or renewal granted by the Appeals Board
may obtain judicial review thereof by a proceeding in the Municipal Court.
   (f)   Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant
hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency
provisions and procedures of this Code to any person or his property.
