codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time;
and
 
   WHEREAS it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification; and
 
   WHEREAS the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter to
be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before the
Council;
 
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SALEM, STATE OF

One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct by
the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of Salem, Ohio.
 
SECTION 2:   That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and immediately
after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All ordinances
and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to August 3, 1981, which are
inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
      (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be

      (Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.02 WHO IS COVERED.
   This chapter applies to all public servants, as the terms defined in this
chapter including elected officials, department administrators and supervisors,
and all members of any board or commission organized or acting on the behalf of
the City of Salem.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.03 DUTIES.
   (a)    No public servant or former public servant shall divulge to any
unauthorized person confidential information acquired in the course of holding
his or her    position in advance of the time prescribed by the governing body,
administrators, or other applicable law for its release to the public.
   (b)    All public servants shall respond fully and truthfully to any
inquiries by the City Attorney or the Board in connection with the
investigation of an alleged or potential violation of this chapter. All public

may request, unless the information requested is exempt from disclosure under
other applicable law.
   (c)    All public servants have a general duty to report any ethical
violations of this chapter of which they have knowledge. Any person may report

   (a)    No public servant shall have a personal interest in any official
action. If a law or policy permits a public servant to have such an interest,
in seeking the opportunity to further that interest, or in furthering the
interest if the opportunity is obtained, the public servant who has the
interest shall comply fully with all procedures required under the applicable
laws or policies, and shall not, under any circumstances, gain or attempt to
gain any advantage by virtue of being in a public position.
   (b)    No public servant shall accept or receive, directly or indirectly,
from any person, including one whose identity is unknown to the public servant,
any personal benefit under circumstances in which it can reasonably be inferred
that the benefit is intended to influence the public servant in the performance
or nonperformance of any official duty or as a reward for any official action
of the public servant.
   (c)    No person, including any vendor, contractor, business, or board of
the City, shall offer or give any personal benefit to any public servant or any
partner-in-interest of the public servant.

future, for the public servant.
   (e)    No current or former public servant shall intentionally use or
disclose information gained in the course of, or by reason of, his or her
official position or activities in any way that could result in the receipt of
any personal benefit for the public servant, for a partner in interest of that
public servant, or for any other person, if the information is not public
information or if the public servant has not been authorized to communicate it
to the public. This provision shall not:

public servants to whose duties the information may be pertinent; or

interest to violate this chapter or to participate in any way in a violation of
this chapter with or by another person.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.06 DELIBERATION AND VOTE PROHIBITED.
   Except as otherwise provided by law, no public servant shall, in such
capacity, participate in the discussion, debate, deliberation or vote, or
otherwise take part in the decision-making process on any agenda item before
the governing body in which the public servant or a partner in interest has a
conflict of interest.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.07 DUTY TO LEAVE MEETING.
   (a)   To avoid the appearance of impropriety, after any public servant or a
partner in interest is determined to have a conflict of interest or a potential
conflict of interest in any matter, and once all questions relating to the
conflict of interest have been answered to the satisfaction of the decision
maker, the public servant shall immediately leave the meeting room, except that
if the matter is being considered at a public meeting, the public servant may
remain in the area of the room occupied by the general public. If a public
servant who has a conflict of interest in a matter is present as a member of a
body which is to consider the matter, the public servant shall leave his or her
regular seat as a member of the body, and not return to it until deliberation
and action on the matter is completed.
   (b)   Nothing herein shall require members of voting bodies to leave their
seats while action is taken regarding any item contained on a “consent agenda”
on which there is no deliberation, the public servant’s conflict has been
disclosed, and the public servant abstains from voting on the item.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.08 PUBLIC CONTRACTS.
   (a)    The City is prohibited from entering into any contract with a
business in which a public servant or a public servant’s partner in interest
has a controlling interest involving services or property without the prior
approval of the majority of members of the legislative body.
   (b)    Any public servant who has or may have a personal interest in any
contract shall disclose such interest prior to the first of any of the events
set forth in (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4) below:
      (1)    The solicitation of a contract; or
      (2)    The bidding of a contract; or
      (3)    The negotiation of a contract; or
      (4)    The approval by the governing body of a contract.
   (c)    Any contract entered into in violation of this section may be voided
by the City in an action commenced within three (3) years of the date on which
the Board of Control, or the department or officer acting for the City in
regard to the allocation of funds from which such payment is derived, knew or
should have known that a violation of this section occurred. This section does
not affect the application of any state statute.
   (d)    Mandatory Provision in Independent Contracts. When the City contracts
with any person to act on behalf of the City as an independent contractor, the
contract shall include a provision which binds the independent contractor, as a
condition of accepting the contract, to comply with the applicable provisions
of this chapter. Any question about whether provisions are applicable,
including the financial disclosure provisions, may be resolved by a written
opinion of the City Attorney or by a decision of the Board of Control. The
governing body, if it deems it necessary or appropriate to do so, may adopt
policies or guidelines to further define the circumstances under which certain
provision will or will not apply to independent contractors.
   (e)    Mandatory Provision in Volunteer Agreements. Any person who serves as
a volunteer on behalf of the City shares in receiving the public’s trust, and
shares in the responsibility to contribute to creating and maintaining an
ethical working environment. Volunteers serve without the expectation of
receiving any compensation from the City, and it is improper for any volunteer
to seek compensation from any person served by the volunteer. Volunteers,
unless expressly authorized by a public servant empowered to grant such
authorization, are prohibited from acting as volunteers in any matter in which
they have or may have a personal interest or in connection with which they
expect or hope to receive any personal benefit. Prior to serving as a
volunteer, and as a condition of serving as a volunteer, each volunteer shall
sign an agreement, prepared by or under the supervision of the City Attorney,
which includes a provision which binds the volunteer to comply with the
applicable provisions of this Ordinance. Any question about whether provisions
are applicable, including the financial disclosure provisions, may be resolved
by a written opinion of the City Attorney or by a decision of the Board of
Control. The governing body, if it deems it necessary or appropriate to do so,
may adopt policies or guidelines to further define the circumstances under
which certain provisions will or will not apply to volunteers.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.09 DISCLOSURE OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   (a)    A public servant who has or may have, a conflict of interest in a
matter which requires an official action by any decision maker, shall, before
the matter is decided, disclose the conflict of interest or the potential or
alleged conflict of interest; if the public servant believes that no conflict
of interest exists, or that despite any alleged or potential special interest,
such public servant is nevertheless able to vote and otherwise participate
fairly, objectively and in a manner consistent with the public interest, then
the public servant shall so state in the written disclosure. All questions
relating to a special interest shall be resolved before the matter is decided,
and if the matter comes before the public servant, before the public servant
engages in any consideration of the merits of the matter.
   (b)    Any public servant who has or may have a conflict of interest shall
disclose it to the Council Clerk or secretary of the body, board or commission
of which the public servant serves. After receiving a disclosure, the City
Clerk or secretary shall:
      (1)    Maintain a record of such disclosure which shall be open to the
public; and
      (2)    Promptly forward a copy of the disclosure to the members of the
body, board or commission of which the public servant serves.
      (3)    Promptly forward a copy of the disclosure to any person who is
named in the disclosure as having or potentially having a conflict of interest;
and
      (4)    Promptly forward a copy of the disclosure to the City Attorney.
   (c)    Any public servant who believes that any other public servant has a
conflict of interest in any agenda item before a governmental body shall
disclose such interest to the City Clerk, and the City Clerk shall forward
copies of such disclosure to the person who is alleged to have a conflict of
interest and the City Attorney.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.10 UNAUTHORIZED OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT.
   A public servant shall not accept any employment, nor enter into any
contract, nor perform any service for compensation that results in a financial
conflict of interest or a conflict of loyalties which would affect the
performance of the public servant’s official duties.
(Ord. 010501-34. Passed 5-15-01.)
109.11 SIGNED ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
   (a)    All public servants including elected officials, department
administrators and supervisors and members of any board or commission shall
sign an acknowledgment indicating that they have an understanding of the
Conflict of Interest Policy as enumerated herein and further that they shall
abide by and be bound by it’s terms. Such signed acknowledgment shall be
provided to each elected official at the commencement of his or her term and
shall be reaffirmed by new acknowledgment upon the commencement of each
successive term. Acknowledgment by department administrators and supervisors

their responsibility or requirement to follow the terms of this Conflict of
Interest Policy as described in Chapter
109.

form shall upon passage of this Ordinance be forthwith disseminated by the

administrators and supervisors and members of any Board and/or Commission.

CHAPTER 111
Citywide Fee Schedule
111.01    Purpose.
111.02    Modification and review of fee schedule.
111.03    Conflicting provisions.
111.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to set a City Fee Schedule (Fee Schedule) for
all fees associated with any City governmental purpose. The intent of this
section is to consolidate into one concise ordinance a schedule of all fees in
order to make those fees more readily available for the public and to ensure
that they are reviewed and modified on a regular basis.
(Ord. 240716-55. Passed 7-16-24.)
111.02 MODIFICATION AND REVIEW OF FEE SCHEDULE.
   (a)    The fees set out in the Citywide fee schedule are the fees associated
with each and every department of the City of Salem together with the section
of the Codified Ordinances associated with those fees. All fees associated with
the City's Parks Department shall be proposed by the City Parks Director and
ratified by a majority of the Salem City Parks Commission, all fees associated
with the Salem Utilities Department shall be proposed by the City Utilities
Superintendent and ratified by a majority of the Salem Utilities Commission,
all fees associated with the Salem Health Department shall be proposed by the
City Health Commissioner and ratified by a majority of the Salem City Board of
Health. All other City fees shall be proposed by the Mayor and ratified by a
majority of Council.
 
   (b)    The Fee Schedule shall be reviewed annually by the Mayor, Parks
Director, Utilities Superintendent, and Health Commissioner to determine if any
modifications are necessary. In order to determine the impact the fees may have
on the annual budget, the Mayor, Parks Director, Utilities Superintendent and
Health Commissioner shall use their best efforts to recommend modifications to
the fees prior to the budget discussions occurring in October with final
determinations of fees being set by January 1st. However, any fee may be
modified at anytime during the year if it is in the best interest of the City
and/or the public. If any adjustments are made to any fees, and ratified as
required, then the Mayor, Parks Director, Utilities Superintendent, or Health

      (Ord. 930316-37. Passed 4-20-93.)
165.13 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Policy. Sexual harassment is an unlawful employment practice which is
in violation of Title VII, Section 703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Therefore the City expressly prohibits any acts of sexual harassment by
supervisors, other staff members and others on City property.
   (b)   Definition. Sexual harassment is defined as: unwelcome sexual
advances; requests for sexual favors; other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature where any one of the following criteria are met:
      (1)   Submission to the conduct is either an explicit or implicit term or
condition of employment/promotion.
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for an
employment decision affecting the person rejecting or submitting to the
conduct.
      (3)   The conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering
with the affected person's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile or offensive work environment.
   (c)   Procedure.
      (1)   Employee responsibility. Any employee who believes that he or she
is being sexually harassed by anyone on the premises of the City should
promptly take the following steps:
         A.   Politely, but firmly, confront whoever is doing the harassing.
State how you feel about his/her actions and request that the person cease
harassing you immediately.
         B.   If the harassment continues or if you believe some employment
consequences may result from your confrontation; or if you feel uncomfortable
confronting the harasser, go to your immediate supervisor. If you believe your
immediate supervisor may be involved, contact either the Chief of Police or
Safety Director. If you believe they may be involved, you may contact the Mayor
or in his/her absence, the President of Council; verbally or in writing,
stating specific details of the sexually harassing behavior.
         C.   The policy of the City is to listen to all reasonable complaints,
seek early corroboration, and apply discipline when appropriate.
         D.   Sexual harassment is a serious offense for which appropriate
disciplinary action will be taken, to include discharge.
      (2)   Management responsibility. Every supervisor of the City is
responsible for ensuring that no sexual harassment will be tolerated within
his/her area of authority.
         A.   Any complaint of sexual harassment should receive the immediate
attention of the supervisor or officer to whom it is made and should be
reported immediately to the Chief of Police.
         B.   Investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment normally will
include conferring with the parties and witnesses named by complaining
employee.
         C.   Because of their sensitive nature, complaints of sexual
harassment should be investigated with particular care and should remain, to
the extent possible, strictly confidential.
         D.   In no event, will information concerning a complaint of sexual
harassment be voluntarily released by the City to third parties or to anyone
within the City who is not involved with the investigation. The purpose of this
provision is to protect the confidentiality of the employee who files a
complaint, to encourage the reporting of any incidents of sexual harassment,
and to protect the reputation of any employee wrongfully charged with sexual
harassment. The Ohio Public Records Act may require that records be released to
the public.
         E.   If the investigation reveals that the complaint is valid, prompt
disciplinary action designed to stop the harassment immediately and to prevent
its recurrence will be taken.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Failure to pay fine.
171.02   Fees for representation of indigents.
171.03   Violations Bureau.

interest, assessment, or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or

a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City

require such additional information as the Administrator may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the
Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, the
Administrator shall make such allocation as the Administrator deems appropriate
to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
 
   (o)    Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net

181.16  REFUNDS.
   (a)    Should it appear that any taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter, a
refund or credit of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided a proper
claim for refund of such overpayment of tax has been filed by the taxpayer
within three years of the due date or filing date of the tax return, whichever
is later. However, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld
from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)    A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)    A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the
tax years in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates
will be used to compute the refund amount.
      (3)    Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
 
   (b)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Salem, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City of
Salem as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of Salem, but was
deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the City
of Salem. The City of Salem will allow a non-refundable credit for any amount
owed the City of Salem that is in excess of the amount to be refunded by the
other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other municipality is the
same or higher than the City of Salem’s tax rate. If the City of Salem’s tax
rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the rates is also
subject to collection by the City of Salem.
 
   (c)    Overpayments of withheld tax that have resulted due to incorrect
withholding of an employee by an employer, and are not due as a result of
excess withholding requested by the employee, shall be refunded to the
employer. It shall be the responsibility of the employer, and not the
Municipality, to refund such overpayment to the employee. However, nothing in
this subparagraph shall affect the right of a nonresident employee to apply
directly to the Municipality for refund of income tax withheld for days worked
out of Salem.

the income or net profits of a taxpayer under order or subpoena of the Tax
Administrator; or
      (7)    Refusing to disclose to the Tax Administrator any information with
respect to the income or net profits of a taxpayer; or
      (8)    Failing to comply with the provisions of this chapter of any order
or subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby; or
      (9)    Attempting to do anything whatever to avoid the payment of the
whole or any part of the tax, penalties or interest imposed by this chapter.
 
   (b)    Whoever violates any of the provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than six months or both, for each
offense.

limitation of time within which prosecution must be commenced shall be six
years from the date the return was due or the date the false or fraudulent
return was filed.
 
   (d)    The failure of any employer or taxpayer or person to receive or
procure a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from
making any information return or declaration, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.

payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer

liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.

employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld.
       (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be

the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.

liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
182.081  of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
182.03  of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 182.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03  of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

182.091  of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
    (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax

      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
 182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
       (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

182.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City, but who receives net
profits, income, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation, for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
City, if it be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax on such
net profits, income, salaries, wages, commission or other compensation to
another municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this
chapter of the amount so paid by him or in his behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on
such net profit, income, salary, wages, commission or compensation earned in
such other municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 182.081  of this Chapter. (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096 , the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081  of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092  of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
182.051  of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
          (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
          (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
                (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds
ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10  of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the

attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths; provided that the powers

income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 151020-58.
Passed 11-17-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Sctieon
 182.10  of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99  of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
 182.10  of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99  of this Chapter for a violation o
f 182.15  of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the
Tax Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)    A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
182.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096  of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
       (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section 1
82.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
           (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 151020-58. Passed 11-17-15.)
182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt

Salem taxpayers who are retired for the entire tax year receiving only Social
Security, pension, interest or dividend income, and who are not self-employed
or owners of rental property, are required to file a Salem City exemption
return once to identify their status. However, if the taxpayer's income or
employment status changes during any year, or if there are any gambling or
lottery winnings the taxpayer would again be required to comply with Section
182.091 (A)(1) herein.
 
   (B)   CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION
      (1)   All employers, businesses, contractors or subcontractors who do
work in the City shall register with the Income Tax Department of the City and

others who may do work for them whose profits, wages or earnings are not
presently subject to withholding of the Salem City Income Tax before they begin
doing business therein. Further, all employers, businesses, contractors or
subcontractors have a continuing duty to notify the City Income Tax Department
of any additional employees, subcontractors, contractors or others when such
new employee, subcontractor, contractor or other is hired or contracted with or
by such employer, business, contractor or subcontractor. There shall be no cost
for the registration of any business, employee, contractor or subcontractors
thereof.
      (2)    Tax Registration Requirements for Construction Permits.
         (a)   All contractors involved in any project within the incorporated
city limits whether general contractor, subcontractor or other, must be
identified and registered with the City Income Tax Department before any permit
from the Housing, Planning and Zoning Office will be issued for the project.
The general contractor, or owner if self-contracted, is responsible for
notifying any additional contractors brought into the project after the start
of the project that income tax registration is required.
         (b)    In the event that an unregistered contractor is discovered
performing work within the city limits, the City Income Tax Department shall
have the authority to stop the project until such time as contractor or
contractors are in compliance. The City Income Tax Department shall also have
the authority to stop any project where the contractor or contractors are
registered but one or more is delinquent in filing city income tax or paying

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon

section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section junk vehicle means any vehicle that
meets the requirements of Ohio Revised Code Section 4513.63(B) to (E) and is
abandoned, inoperative, partially or fully dismantled or wrecked, or is without
a currently valid license plate. Any such vehicle shall be categorized as
either:
      (1)   Restorable- repairs could be made without exceeding the estimated
value to place vehicle in operating condition; or
      (2)   Wrecked - economically infeasible to restore to operating
condition. The Service Director or other designated official shall make the
final determination as to the categorization of any such vehicle.
   (b)   Definitions:
      (1)   “Inoperative condition” means that a vehicle is incapable of being
propelled under its own power.
      (2)   “Partially dismantled condition” means that a vehicle has some part
missing which is ordinarily an essential component thereof.
      (3)   “Garage” means an enclosed building or part thereof accessory to a
main building provided for the storage of passenger automobiles and in which no
occupation, business or service for profit is carried on.
      (4)   “Collector’s vehicle” means any motor vehicle which is twenty-five
years old or older, and which is owned solely as a collector’s item and for
participation in club activities, exhibitions, tours, parades and similar uses,
but in no event to be used for general transportation.
   (c)   No junk vehicle as described in this section shall be left in the open
on private property for more than seventy-two hours with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person
is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under
authority of Ohio Revised Code 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority
of the Municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is
not subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority; or unless
the person having the right to the possession of the property can establish
that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the
motor vehicle is a collector’s vehicle.
   (d)   The Chief of Police, Service Director or any designated personnel may
bring or mail notice to the person having the right to the possession of the
property on which the junk motor vehicle is left. Within ten days of receipt of
the notice, the junk vehicle either shall be housed in a garage or shall be
removed from the property.
   (e)   No person shall willfully leave a junk vehicle in the open for more
than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The fact
that the junk vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful failure to
comply with the notice and may result in a citation being issued and the junk
vehicle towed at the property owner’s expense. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
(Ord. 010619-40. Passed 7-5-01.)

         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43 .
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991  of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a

the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

(ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)

privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

consecutively to the period of house arrest.
As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of sixty consecutive days required
by subsection (h)(1)C.2. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

339.01 PERMIT REQUIRED TO EXCEED LOAD LIMITS.
      (a)   (1)    The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
         A.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
         B.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of Municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
         C.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject to
the payment of a fee established by the Municipality in accordance with this
section.
      (2)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
   (b)   (1)    Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Ohio Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34
may move the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any
highway that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly
within and partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No local
authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee
or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
      (2)    Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be
issued for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in
its discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public
construction project.
   (c)    (1)   The application for a permit issued under this section shall be
in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a
permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
      (2)    For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
      (3)   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
   
   (d)    The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under subsection (a)(1) of this section upon application and payment of the
applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in subsection (a)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (e)    Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
   (f)    The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
   (g)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(G).
   (h)   (1)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to gross load limits.
      (2)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
      (3)   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (i)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer. (ORC 4513.34)
   (j)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

339.01.
   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or for such
period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his discretion
deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction project. The Police
Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of operation for such vehicle
or combination of vehicles by designating the route, hours, speed or such other
restrictions as may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety. The Police Chief may require the posting of bond
or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge ten dollars ($10.00),
and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police officer in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per hour per officer. The charge can be prorated
into fifteen minute increments.
   Signs shall be posted to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed by this
section. Such signs shall be in accordance with the standards for traffic
control devices of the State Department of Transportation. No driver shall
disobey the instructions indicated on any such sign.
   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the permit
granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit, and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalty prescribed by
subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second offense within one year after the first offense, the
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers,
   agents or employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
 
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
 
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum
Misdemeanor                  Fine
First degree                 $ 5000.00
Second degree             4000.00
Third degree                 3000.00
Fourth degree             2000.00
Minor                        1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31)
 
   (d)   Upon the motion of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to
a misdemeanor, the court may in its discretion require that person to perform
supervised community service work under authority of the City of Salem in lieu
of imprisonment or the payment of a fine or the payment of court costs or any
combination thereof. The following do not control the court’s discretion, but
shall be considered in favor of allowing an offender to perform supervised
community service work in lieu of imprisonment or the payment of a fine:
      (1)   The offense did not cause property damage or personal injury to
others.
      (2)   The offense was the result in circumstances unlikely to recur.
      (3)   The offender has no history of prior delinquency or criminal
activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period before
commission of the present offense.
      (4)   The character and attitude of the offender indicate that he is
unlikely to commit another offense.
      (5)   Imprisonment of the offender will entail undue hardship to himself
or his dependents.
   Supervised community service under this section shall not be required as a
condition of probation or other suspension unless the offender agrees to the
service work offered.

notify the owner, keeper, or harborer of that dog, pursuant to the Rules for
Service as set out in the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, of both of the
following:
      (1)    That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous

hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this section. The notice

dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as applicable, until the court makes a final

apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that
manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or
harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under Section

has occurred, the Board shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of

representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation
conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board or its
staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent

   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil rights Commission in any investigation under

discretion dismiss such complaint or order such further investigation as may be
necessary.

the statement of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by

this chapter. The interested parties may, at their option, appear before the
Board in person or by duly authorized representative and may have the
assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony and evidence, and
the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and
evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The Board shall keep a
full record of the hearing, which record shall be public and open to inspection
by any person, and upon request by a principal party to the proceeding, the
Board shall furnish such party a copy of the hearing record, if any, at such
cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter,
with notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has
not after fifteen (15) calendar days following service of the Board's order
complied with the order. The Board will recertify the matter to the Law
Director for enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City of Salem before a court of competent jurisdiction. In
any such proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation
of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where
appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also
order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and make public
its findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall

      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,

implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an aircraft and if
the violation does not create a risk of physical harm to any person, and if the

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,

545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,  
545.06 or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

557.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms, phrases, words and
their derivations have the meaning given herein.
   (a)    "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen years.
   (b)    "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)    As a natural or adoptive parent,
      (2)    As a legal guardian,
      (3)    As a person who stands in loco parentis, or
      (4)    As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of
court.
   (c)    "Public place" means any street, highway, alley or right of way, to
include sidewalks; any park, playground, ground, place or building open to the
public; any privately or publicly owned place of amusement, entertainment, or
public accommodation, to include parking lots and other areas adjacent thereto;
and any vacant lot or land or, without the consent of the owner, any private
property.
   (d)    "Time of night" referred to herein, is based upon the prevailing
standard of time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the
Municipality, prima facie the time then observed in the Municipal
Administrative Offices and Police Station.
   (e)    "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth
to, but not including the day of the next, such as the eighteenth birthday,
making it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as
equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen years of age". Similarly, for example,
eleven or less years of age means under twelve years of age. ( Ord. 900417-42.
Passed 5-1-90.)
557.02 CURFEW HOURS.
   (a)    No person seventeen or less years of age shall be in or upon any
public place during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
      (1)    At 10:00 p.m. for minors fifteen or less years of age; and
      (2)    At 12:00 a.m. for minors sixteen or more years of age.
   Such provisions of law shall be in effect daily except Friday and Saturday
when such curfew hours shall begin:
      (1)    At 11:00 p.m. for minors fifteen or less years of age; and
      (2)    At 1:00 a.m. for minors sixteen or more years of age.
   (b)    Any minor violating the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of
an act of unruliness and shall be cited to the County Juvenile Court.
(Ord. 900417-42. Passed 5-1-90.)
557.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   In the following exceptional cases, a minor in or upon a public place during
the nocturnal hours for which Section
557.02 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
   (a)    When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   (b)    When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   (c)    When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by
first delivering to the Police Department written communication signed by such
minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor with their
home address and telephone number, addressed to the Police Chief, specifying
when, where and in what matter the minor will be in a public place at night
during the hours when this chapter is otherwise applicable to the minor, in the
exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such communication.
   (d)    In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent
has communicated to the Police Department personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity and designating the minor's proposed location, route,
purpose and the period of time the minor will be in or upon a public place.
   (e)    When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the police officer.
   (f)    When returning home by a direct route from, and within thirty minutes
of, the termination of a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
other voluntary association or which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to and duly filed for
immediate reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station.
   (g)    When authorized by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor, when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be
inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter. A written
application shall be given to the Mayor, signed by a minor and by a parent of
such minor, if feasible, stating:
      (1)    The name, age and address of such minor;
      (2)    The name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof;
      (3)    The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical
characteristics of such minor;
      (4)    The necessity which requires such minor be in or upon a public
place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; and
      (5)    The street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of
time involved by date and hour.
The Mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use by the minor of those
public places at such hours as in the Mayor's opinion may reasonably be
necessary. In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone, or other
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Mayor, or if unavailable, to the Police Chief.
   (h)    When authorized by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary
night-time activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis. Normally such regulation by the Mayor
permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of public
places permitted, and the period of time involved not to extend more than
thirty minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity.
   (i)    When the minor carries a certified card of employment, briefly
identifying the minor, the address of his home and place of employment and his
hours of employment.
(Ord. 900417-42. Passed 5-1-90.)
557.04 PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)    No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or
by inefficient control allow such minor to be in or upon any public place under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter. "Knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
   (b)   It shall be an affirmative defense to this section that such parent
has within thirty days preceding the alleged violation filed or caused to be
filed a complaint against such minor under Ohio R.C. 2151.27.
   (c)   A parent who violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
for the first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each
subsequent offense.
(Ord. 900417-42. Passed 5-1-90.)
557.99 PENALTY.
   All minors found in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be
taken to the City Hall and parents, guardians or persons in loco parentis shall
be notified to come to the City Hall and take personal charge of such minors.
The minor shall be released only to such parent, guardian or persons in loco
parentis, or to the juvenile authorities. Any minor found in violation of this
chapter who has once been held by the authorities for violation of this chapter
shall be held for juvenile authorities for proper disposition.
(Ord. 900417-42. Passed 5-1-90.)

701.03  ROTATION SYSTEMS.
   (a)    The City of Salem shall use and maintain a call-by-call rotation
system for ambulance calls received by the City dispatch center. The call-by-
call rotation shall be limited to no more than three (3) separate and unrelated
private ambulance providers. For any emergency call originating through the
City of Salem or any of its departments, when the patient/caller does not
indicate an unsolicited "choice," the dispatcher shall contact the next
provider on the rotation list. If that provider is not available or cannot
arrive within the designated response time as set out hereafter in subsections
(b) and (c) of this Section, the dispatcher will contact the next provider in
the rotation. If this ambulance is also unavailable to respond as required by
this ordinance, the City may dispatch the City Fire Department Ambulance if
available. The dispatcher may use discretion to handle dropped calls or
necessary back up calls. The City dispatcher shall comply with the rotation
list, but in times of exceptional call volume requests, may use their
discretion to call any provider to ensure that proper emergency services are
dispatched.
      (1)   When an ambulance company participating in the ambulance rotation
system is called directly for a medical emergency by any client, consumer or
such other non-City dispatch or personnel for a life threatening emergency,
said ambulance company must notify the Salem Dispatch immediately and directly
for the purposes of dispatching first responders if said ambulance company's
response time will exceed five (5) minutes.
   (b)   Each ambulance company wishing to participate in the rotation system
to provide emergency medical and ambulance services to the citizens of the City
of Salem shall be required to have and maintain a physical building within the
Salem City Limits not later than thirty (30) days from the time in which this
section takes effect. Such building must conform to the standards as set out by
the Ohio Medical Transportation Board, the Ohio Pharmacy Board, the Ohio
Revised Code and all other relevant Fire and Building Codes as deemed necessary
by the State of Ohio or the City of Salem. The Ambulance Review Board shall
have discretion to grant an additional thirty (30) days for an ambulance
company to obtain a compliant building, or to bring a building into compliance,
after this section takes effect. The ambulance company must be licensed by the
State of Ohio, meet all statutory requirements as outlined in the Ohio Revised
Code and operate as advanced life support service under the Ohio Ambulance
Licensing Board (OALB). Each company wishing to be included in this rotation
must submit a copy of their current State of Ohio Ambulance License to the
Ambulance Review Board through the Director of Public Service and Safety. It is
the responsibility of each ambulance company to ensure that a current OALB
license is on file with the Ambulance Review Board. In order to qualify to
participate in the rotation, each providing ambulance company must have a
paramedic staff and an advanced life support equipped emergency unit. Such unit
must be capable of responding to emergency calls from the City dispatch within
nine (9) minutes of the call receipt to be on the scene.
        Anytime an ambulance company that is part of the current rotation does
not have a unit in the City, or has no units available due to other emergencies
or issues, they shall notify dispatch and go off of the rotation until a unit
returns to the City or they have units available in the City for immediate use.
   (c) An Ambulance Review Board is hereby created which shall consist of five
(5) persons and include, the Fire Chief, and the Director of Public Service and
Safety, a member of Council who is the Safety Committee Chairperson, an
individual not employed by the City of Salem as determined by a majority of the
previous three (3) members, and a City resident appointed by the Mayor. The
last two (2) members of the Board shall be confirmed by Council. No member of
the Board may have any personal or financial interest in any ambulance service
that is a part of the ambulance rotation. The Ambulance Review Board will
decide in their absolute discretion whether any ambulance provider shall be
listed on the City rotation list. In making this decision they will use the
applicant's service record and performance in this or other communities. Other
factors to consider are:
            (1)    Overall response time integrity.
      (2)    Percentage of time the company has not had ambulance available to
respond to calls initiated by government entities or medical facilities.
      (3)   The ability to place an ambulance on the scene of an emergency
(Code III) within nine (9) minutes or less, ninety percent (90%) of the time,
and the ability to place an ambulance on the scene of a non-emergency immediate
dispatch (Code II) within fifteen (15) minutes or less, ninety percent (90%) of
the time. The City understands that due to periods of inclement weather or
other hazardous road conditions that response times may be slightly longer. Due
to the safety of all personnel involved such occasions shall be noted as
excused exceptions by the Ambulance Review Board on a case by case basis.
           (4)    The number and types of Basic Life Support and Advanced Life
Support ambulances operated twenty-four (24) hours a day.
      (5)   Responsiveness to handling of complaints.
      (6)   Ability to provide computer generated response time reports.
      (7)   Willingness to participate in disaster planning.
      (8)   Willingness to provide "stand-by service" at community events.
      (9)   Ability and commitment to respond to community needs as demand for
service increases.
      (10)   Ability to retain for thirty (30) days voice recordings of all its
dispatch telephone lines and its two-way radio traffic.
      (11)   Whether the provider has a business location in the City.
      (12)   Any other relevant factor.
   (d)   The Ambulance Review Board shall at their discretion convene meetings
and adopt rules for their meetings that they deem necessary for the
administration of this section. Further, the Ambulance Review Board in addition
to determining what ambulance companies will be on the rotation, can demand
response times or other relevant information to determine that ambulance
companies are in compliance with this section. The Ambulance Review Board is
further empowered to remove an ambulance company from the rotation based upon
any or all of the factors listed in subsection (c) above.
   (e)   If a registered ambulance company, that is part of the current

739.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose: Pursuant to the authority of the City of Salem to promote and
secure the health cleanliness, comfort and safety of the citizens of the Cit y
of Salem, to regulate and inspect the use and occupancy of public buildings, to
regulate places of public entertainment, amusement and recreation, and to
prevent and prohibit public nuisances due to adverse secondary effects, the
City of Salem (hereinafter “City”) enacts this chapter to minimize and control
the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby
protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens; protect the citizens’
property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods; and deter the
spread of blight.
      (1)   The Salem City Council has determined that licensing is a
legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of
sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to insure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
      (2)   The Salem City Council does not intend this chapter to suppress any
speech activities protected by the First Amendment, but to enact a content
neutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented
businesses. It is not the intent of the Salem City Council in acting this
legislation to deny any person rights of speech protected by the Constitution
of the United States or the Constitution of Ohio, or both, nor is it the intent
of the Salem City Council to impose by this chapter any additional limitations
or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials, including
sexually oriented films, videotapes, books and other materials. Further, by
enacting this legislation, the Salem City Council does not intend to deny or
restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view, or both, any sexually
oriented materials or conduct protected by the Constitution of the United
States or the Constitution of Ohio, or both, nor does it intend to restrict or
deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of
sexually oriented may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit these materials.
   (b)   Legislative Findings: The Salem City Council finds:
      (1)   Law enforcement personnel have determined, and statistics and
studies performed in a substantial number of communities in the United States
indicate that sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which
should be regulated to protect the public health, safety and welfare. These
secondary effects include, but are not limited to, the spread of communicable
diseases, performance of sexual acts in public places, presence of discarded
sexually oriented materials on public and private property, sexual harassment,
obscenity, prostitution and other illegal sexual activities, crime decreased
property values and neighborhood deterioration.
      (2)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on the community presented in depositions and hearings conducted by the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Case No.
3:CV99-1801 (Judge Munley), and by the United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania, Case No. 98- 1140 (Judge Lancaster); and in
reports made available to the City of Salem and on findings incorporated in the
cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young
v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), and Barnes v. Glen Theatre,
Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and on studies in other communities including, but
not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Biloxi, Mississippi; Seattle,
Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and
also on findings from the report of the Attorney General’s Working Group on the
Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
the City finds:
         A.   Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the
operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to
make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that
occur on their premises.
         B.   Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this
chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain
types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
         C.   Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or
semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
Furthermore, adult bookstores tend to attract homosexual men who engage in
unprotected high risk sexual activities.
         D.   Offering and providing such space encourages such activities,
which creates unhealthy conditions.
         E.   Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the
premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
         F.   At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital
herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella
infections.
         G.   The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October
22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
         H.   According to the best specific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection,
as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
         I.   Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
         J.   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found
in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view “adult”
oriented films.
         K.   Numerous studies have indicated that sexually oriented businesses
have a substantial negative impact on property values and cause neighborhood
blight.
         L.   The findings noted in paragraphs A. through K. raise substantial
governmental concerns.
      (3)   Sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects in the
nature of a public nuisance, which secondary effects should be regulated to
protect the public health, safety and welfare.
      (4)   Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (5)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators
of the sexually oriented business. Further, such a licensing procedure will
place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the
sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health,
safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the
City of Salem. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the
licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in
possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
      (6)   Removal of doors and curtains on adult booths and requiring
sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in adult theaters and bookstores.
      (7)   Requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep
information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help
reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the
identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from
working in such establishments.
      (8)   The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually
oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the
significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (9)   It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable
diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees
who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who
are likely to be witnesses to such activity.
      (10)   The fact that an applicant for an adult or sexually oriented use
license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational
assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in
contravention of this chapter.
      (11)   The barring of such individuals from the management of sexually
oriented uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents
conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.
      (12)   The general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of the City
will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.
      (13)   The limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses
from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays, and closure of such
businesses on Sundays and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of
such businesses, including, particularly, but not limited to, late night noise
levels, crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas,
and promotes the public health, safety and welfare.
      (14)   The reasonable regulation and supervision of sexually oriented
businesses tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution and thereby promote
the health, safety and welfare of patrons, clients and customers of these
businesses.
      (15)   The unregulated operation of such sexually oriented businesses
would be detrimental to the general health, safety and welfare of citizens of
the City of Salem.

inspector.
   (d)    Retainer Fee. The person shall deposit with the City a retainer fee
prior to the start of the work of sixteen cents (16¢) per foot of pipe as
indicated on the plans. Such retainer fee shall be used to defray the cost of

   (e)    Residential Streets and All Others      $50.00*
   (f)    *Plus $25.00 for every fifty (50) foot section after the initial
fifty (50) feet covered by the base permit fee and $10.00 for each additional
opening after the first made anywhere along the long line excavation.
Inspection charges shall be the responsibility of the party requesting the
excavation permit and shall be due and payable upon invoice by the Zoning
Officer and shall be kept current. The City will contract with an engineering
firm familiar with the City infrastructure and codes, for inspection purposes.
The estimated cost for inspection services from the engineering firm shall be
paid in advance by the person or entity requesting the long line excavation
permit and will be paid out to the engineering firm by the City Auditor
pursuant to invoicing from the engineering firm for the inspection work as it
is done. Any unused balance remaining at the conclusion of the project which
was deposited for inspection shall be returned to the permit holder. If issues
arise that require additional inspection, then the permit holder shall deposit
any amount estimated by the engineer to continue the project associated with
the excavation. The failure to deposit or maintain current inspection fees will
be just cause for the refusal of all future permits of any type and the
revocation of any current permits. Detailed plans governing long line work
shall be submitted at least ten days prior to permit application for approval
by the Zoning Officer, or their designated agent. No permit governing this work
will be issued prior to approval of detailed plans. Plan approval includes
location of work, methods of construction, types of materials, pedestrian and
vehicular traffic controls, types of pavement restoration, lawn restoration,
time limits and any other requirement deemed necessary to insure the public
health, safety and welfare.
   (g)    No permit shall be issued to any person or entity unless the person
or entity requesting the permit designates a single point of contact for a
person that can be reached twenty four (24) hours a day to address any problems
that may arise from the excavation.
      (Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.04 RESTORATION OF OPENINGS; FEES.
   (a)   Restoration of all openings in pavement areas shall be performed by
the applicant. All restoration, whether in paved areas or unpaved areas, and
whether they are in street-opening-permit areas or long line permit areas,
shall be in accordance with the ordinances of the City of Salem, the
requirements of the Ohio Revised Code, or those deemed applicable to the
condition of the excavated area as determined by the Zoning Officer, or their
designated agent. The City shall reserve the right to repair or replace any
restored area which is not deemed acceptable by the Zoning Officer, or their
designated agent and assess all costs including a fifteen percent (15%)
administrative fee to the applicant.
   (b)   When restorations are made by the City, the applicant shall be
assessed the actual cost of the restoration, including all labor, material and
equipment costs including an administrative charge of fifteen percent (15%).
Payment for restoration charges shall be kept current or existing or future
permits may be revoked or denied. In the event that a restoration being
performed by the applicant is not proceeding satisfactorily, the Zoning
Officer, or their designated agent may order the work performed by City forces
with charges assessed as described in this section. A penalty of fifty dollars
($50.00) a day may be assessed against the permit holder for each day beyond
the permit deadline that street openings are not available for restoration by
the Street Department.
(Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.05 OPENINGS IN NEW PAVEMENTS.
   New pavements shall be considered those pavements which have been newly
constructed in part, or in total or newly resurfaced in part, or in total in
the five-year period prior to the permit application date.
   Permit fees for openings in new pavements shall be five (5) times the normal
fee as outlined in Section
961.02 , and permits in new pavements shall be issued only with written
approval of the Zoning Officer, or their designated agent. The increase in fee
shall not apply to inspection charges or restoration charges.
   In the case of long line permits in new pavements, the fee shall be five (5)
times the normal fee as outlined in Section
961.03 , and permits shall be issued only after approval of detailed plans and
with written approval of the Zoning Officer, or their designated agent. In the
event of a long line street opening for a roadway which had been newly
constructed in part, or in total or newly resurfaced in part, or in total in
the three-year period prior to the permit application date, the Zoning Officer,
or their designated agent reserves the right to require full-width restoration
and paving of the affected area of roadway at the applicant's expense.
(Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.06 EMERGENCY OPENINGS.
   In the event of an emergency, or where the public health, safety and welfare
are involved, street openings may be made immediately by the proper authority
provided, however, that immediate notification be given to the Zoning Officer,
or their designated agent. The intent of this section is the waiver of prior
application and approvals by the Zoning Officer, or their designated agent. In
no case is it intended that permit fees, restoration fees or inspection fees be
waived. These are computed and levied as previously described in the above
various sections. (Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.07 LIABILITY AND BOND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    All firms, corporations, companies or individuals seeking the
issuance of a permit for performance of any of the services or work above set
out shall, at the time before a permit is issued, furnish a liability insurance
rider or policy of liability insurance, against personal liability and/ or
property damage, indemnifying the City against all loss as a result of their
performance under such permit in sums of one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000) to three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for personal injury and
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for
property damage as the Zoning Officer or their designated agent deems
appropriate.
   (b)    Before any right of way excavation permit is issued, the applicant
shall post a performance bond in such conditions as the Zoning Officer, or his
designated agent deems appropriate. In the event an applicant or their
contractor fails to complete the project, make repairs, or provide restoration
within thirty (30) days from the permit expiration date, the bonding company
shall have the necessary repairs, restoration or project completed. Failure of
the bonding company to proceed within seven (7) days of notice shall be cause
for the City to complete the repairs at the bonding company's expense as set
out in Section
961.04 , and for the revocation of the permit of the applicant and for any such
other remedy allowed by these ordinances and/or the State of Ohio.
(Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.08 TRAFFIC CONTROL NOTICE TO THE CITY DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND
SAFETY.
   No permit holder for right of way excavation shall commence any excavation
work without first notifying the Director of Public Service and Safety or the
City Chief of Police that such work is about to be commenced. The permit holder
shall be responsible for all traffic control issues in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the City of Salem as set out in the ordinances or
designated by the Director of Public Service and Safety or the Chief of Police.
(Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)

making the improvement or doing the work, immediately upon the completion of
the same.
   (b)   Stockpiling and storing of dirt or excavated material from building
excavations, street or sewer excavations, on residentially zoned areas other
than on the prime construction site and immediate adjacent areas is prohibited.
The area surrounding the prime construction site and adjacent sidewalks and
streets shall be kept clean of all dirt and material until the completion of
the project and the restoration of the area.
(Ord. 250128-08. Passed 2-4-25.)
961.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty is
provided is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Whoever violates
Section 961.09(b) is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

relate to the community master plan, design standards, Zoning Ordinance and
improvement requirements and informs and discusses with the subdivider the
results of review.
   (b)    Preliminary Plat.
      (1)    Subdivider arrives at preliminary conclusions; if he decides to
continue, reaches tentative agreements or understandings with those associated
with him, and others concerned such as the lender or the F.H.A.; prepares a
preliminary plat for submission with his application for conditional approval.
      (2)    Planning Commission reviews application and preliminary plat for
conditional approval to determine conformity to subdivision standards; grants
conditional approval, subject to conditions agreed upon, or disapproves,
stating reasons for such action.
   (c)    Final Plat.
      (1)    Subdivider stakes out the tract, or that portion to be first
subdivided, in accord with the preliminary plat as conditionally approved;
installs improvements or posts certified check or bond to guarantee completion
of improvements stipulated; prepares final plat and submits it, with other
required material and documents, with application for approval by the Planning
Commission.
      (2)    Planning Commission reviews application and grants approval of
final plat, or informs subdivider what is lacking to obtain approval for
recording.
      (3)    Subdivider records the approved final plat and other documents;
proceeds with his development plans and program and thereafter disposes of his
lots or houses.
(Ord. 731120-127. Passed 1-15-74.)
1101.05 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section, subsection or provision of these Regulations be declared
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision should not affect

1109.01 PREAPPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the
preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission plans
and data as specified in subsection (c) hereof. This step does not require
formal application, fee or filing of plat with the Planning Commission.
   (b)    Within fifteen days the Planning Commission shall inform the
subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not
meet the objectives of these Regulations. When the Planning Commission finds
the plans and data do not meet the objectives of these Regulations, it shall
express its reasons therefor.
   (c)    Preapplication plans and data shall include the following:
      (1)    General subdivision information shall describe or outline the
existing conditions of the site and the proposed development as necessary to
supplement the drawings required below. This information may include data on
existing covenants, land characteristics, and available community facilities
and utilities; and information describing the subdivision proposal such as
number of residential lots, typical lot width and depth, price range, business
areas, playgrounds, park areas and other public areas, proposed protective
covenants and proposed utilities and street improvements.
      (2)   Location map shall show the relationship of the proposed
subdivision to existing community facilities which serve or influence it and

conditions. The sketch plan may be a freehand pencil sketch made directly on a
print of the topographic survey. In any event, the sketch plan shall include
either the existing topographic data listed in Section
1109.02(f)(1) or such of these data as the Planning Commission and the City
Engineer determines is necessary for its consideration of the proposed sketch
plan.
(Ord. 731120-127. Passed 1-15-74.)
1109.02 CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF THE PRELIMINARY PLAT.
   (a)    On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in Section
1109.01(a) and (b) regarding the general program and objectives, the subdivider
shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plat, together with improvement plans
and other supplementary material as specified in subsection (f) hereof.
 
   (b)    One copy of the preliminary plat and supplementary material specified
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission with written application for
conditional approval at least ten days prior to the meeting at which it is to
be considered.
 
   (c)    Following the review of the preliminary plat and other material
submitted for conformity thereof to these Regulations, and negotiations with
the subdivider on changes deemed advisable and the kind and extent of
improvements to be made by him, the Planning Commission shall, within thirty
days act thereon as submitted, or modified, and if approved, the Planning
Commission shall express its approval as conditional approval and state the
conditions of such approval, if any, or if disapproved, shall express its
disapproval and its reasons therefor.

One copy shall be returned to the subdivider and one copy delivered to the
appropriate official of the municipality and one copy retained by the
Commission.
   (e)    Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval
to the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation
of the final plat which will be submitted for approval of the Planning
Commission and for recording upon fulfillment of the requirements of these
Regulations and the conditions of the conditional approval, if any.
   (f)    Plats and data for conditional approval shall include:

or swales, and at selected points not more than 100 feet apart in all
directions; for land that slopes more than approximately two percent (2%),
either show contours with an interval of not more than five feet if ground
slope is regular and such information is sufficient for planning purposes, or
show contours with an interval of not more than two feet necessary because of
irregular land or need for more detailed data for preparing plans and
construction drawings.
      F.   Subsurface conditions on the tract, if required by the Planning
Commission and the City Service Director upon information provided by a

1113.01 STREETS.
   (a)    The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
   (b)    The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either:
      (1)    Provide for the continuation; or appropriate projection of
existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or
      (2)    Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the
Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other
conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable.
   (c)    Minor streets shall be so laid out so that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
   (d)    Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation
along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (e)    Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way,
the Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on
each side of such right of way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use
of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for
commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances
shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach
grades and future grade separations.
   (f)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited
except where their control is definitely placed on the City under conditions
approved by the Planning Commission.
   (g)    Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall not
be permitted.
   (h)    A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
   (i)    When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than ten degrees, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius
adequate to insure a sight distance of not less than 150 feet for minor and
collector streets, and of such greater radii as the Planning Commission shall
determine for special cases.
   (j)    Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty
degrees.
   (k)    Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of ten feet or of a greater radius where the Planning Commission may deem it
necessary. The Planning Commission may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in

   (m)    Half streets shall be prohibited, except where essential to the
reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these Regulations; and where the Planning Commission finds it
will be practicable to require the dedication of the other half when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a half street is adjacent to a tract
to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such
tract.
   (n)    Dead-end streets shall be prohibited unless not longer than 600 feet
and provided at the closed end with a turn-around having an outside roadway
diameter of at least eighty feet, and a street property line diameter of at
least 100 feet.
   (o)    No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission.
   (p)    Street grades, wherever possible, shall not exceed the following with
due allowance for reasonable vertical curves:

   (a)    Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use is
located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the Planning Commission may
require the dedication or reservation of such area within the subdivision in
those cases in which the Planning Commission deems such requirements to be
reasonable.
   (b)    Where deemed essential by the Planning Commission, upon consideration
of the particular type of development proposed in the subdivision, and

1131.01 TITLE.
   Titles Three, Five and Seven of this Part Eleven - Planning and Zoning Code
shall be referred to as the "Zoning Ordinance".
(Ord. 711103-112. Passed 5-1-73.)
1131.02 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   (a)    These regulations have been designed in the interest of the promotion
of the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity or general
welfare of the residents.
   (b)    These regulations have been based upon the land use plan for the City
which was adopted by the Planning Commission on November 24, 1971.
   (c)    Need for public services and facilities in both size and location
depends upon the character and intensity of land use. Regulation of the use of
land is thus fundamental to a coordinated optimum physical development of the
community. The land use regulations are intended to be the foundation of the
entire process of improvement of the physical environment.
   (d)    The regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing
property uses and values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses.
   (e)    The land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning
districts as the comprehensive plan included careful estimates of the land area
requirements for the various land uses such as commerce, residence, industry,
transportation and public uses. These urban uses should be directed into that
land area where they may be most efficiently served by public services and
facilities such as sewers, water, schools, parks and the like.
      (1)    In the past, residential neighborhoods in large cities have
deteriorated because they were invaded by small isolated commercial uses and by
more intensive residential uses such as duplexes or apartment buildings. The
great majority of our population desire to, and do, live in single-family homes
which they own and which are located on fairly large lots. The regulations
establish four residential districts particularly designed to provide maximum
protection for single-family homes.
      (2)    Two other residential districts are established for two-family
homes and for apartments. Density, yard and parking regulations would insure
good living conditions in these areas. Much of present-day building is by large
projects instead of lot by lot. In order to be responsive to this growing need
the regulations provide for "large scale developments"(ten acres or more) which
may be located in any residential district with approval of the site plan and
with conformity of the plan to the overall density standards of the district.
This introduces an important measure of flexibility into the regulations.
      (3)    Commercial districts recognize the different types of commercial
areas that will be needed by the future growth of the community. There is a
zoning district for the neighborhood commercial area, i.e., the grocery store-
drug store complex serving the adjacent residential neighborhoods. For more
widely used commercial areas along major streets and highways, there is a
general commercial district. There is a central commercial district for the
downtown area and a special "planned district" for shopping centers.
      (4)    For industry there are three districts - a "restricted" district
for the modern organized industrial area with landscaped front yards and no
open storage, a "light" industrial district for nonobnoxious manufacturing and
a "general" or unrestricted industrial district.
      (5)    The regulations emphasize character as well as locations and
density of the land uses. Special inducements are offered for good design of
apartment areas. Landscape planting is required in all front yards and for
automobile filling stations, parking lots and garages. Advertising is carefully
controlled.
      (6)    The regulations are reasonable in relation to existing conditions.
Yard dimensions are adjusted to peculiarities of existing lots. Lots that are
now too small may be used. Nonconforming uses are permitted to continue for
adequate time periods.
      (7)    Most uses are required to provide their own off-street parking.
Over a period of years, enforcement of this requirement will enable streets to
be used primarily for traffic movement.
      (8)    Each of the regulations has been designed to work harmoniously
with the others with the result providing that minimum degree of land use
control essential to the realization of the optimum urban environment.
(Ord. 711103-112. Passed 5-1-73.)
1131.03 INTERPRETATION.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare.
It is not intended by this Zoning Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or
annul any easements, covenants or other agreements between parties, except that
if this Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater restriction, this Zoning Ordinance
shall control.
(Ord. 711102-112. Passed 5-1-73.)

The Planning Commission shall have not less than thirty (30) days in which to
consider and report upon such proposed ordinance, but if no report is received
from the Commission in sixty (60) days it may be assumed that the Commission
has approved the amendment. The report of the Planning Commission shall be
transmitted to Council at which time Council shall set a date for a public
hearing on the proposed change or amendment.
   (d)   In setting the date of such a public hearing, as described in
Paragraph (c), Council shall give at least thirty days notice thereof. Notice
setting forth the time and place of such public hearing and the nature of the
proposed change or amendment shall be given by Council in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City.

   The powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals are:

any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Zoning Officer in
the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   To permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot held in a single ownership at the time of the passage of
this ordinance.
      (3)   To interpret the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in such a way

layout as shown on the Zoning District Map.

      (1)   Use of premises for public utility and railroad purposes or for a
radio or television tower or broadcasting station.

prohibited by Chapter

(Ord. 711103-112. Passed 5-1-73.)
   (c)   To permit the following variations:
      (1)   Vary the yard regulations where there is an exceptional or unusual
physical condition of a lot, which condition is not generally prevalent in the
neighborhood and which condition when related to the yard regulations of the
Zoning Ordinance would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of
buildings on the lot.
      (2)   Vary the parking regulations where an applicant demonstrates
conclusively that the specific use of a building would make unnecessary the
parking spaces required by the Zoning Ordinance, but providing that such a
reduction not be more than fifty percent (50%) of the usual requirement.
      (3)   Vary the landscaping and screening requirements of Chapters
1198.06 , and
1198.07  where there is an exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot,
which such condition when would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of
the buildings on such lot or prevent or appreciably impair or limited intended
use of the buildings on the lot.
      (4)   Vary the yard/setback regulations for signs in Chapter
1195  when applicant demonstrates conclusively that such regulations are

1194  of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Salem on lots fronting on two
streets. This Section shall not apply to corner lots which are defined as lots
having any portion of the lot that touches the connection of any two
intersecting streets. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority to
vary said regulations with regard to the frontage on one side or the other but
not both and may do so only when there is an exceptional or unusual physical
condition of the lot, which such condition would prevent a reasonable or
sensible arrangement of the fencing on the lot.
         (Ord. 201921-64. Passed 10-19-21.)
   (d)    To grant conditional use permits:
      (1)   To hear and decide upon applications for the conditional use
permits specifically listed in the district regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance. Before authorizing the issuance of such conditional use permit, the
Board may impose such conditions as will, in the Board's judgment insure that:
         A.   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional
use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals,
comfort or general welfare.
         B.   The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and
enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purpose already
permitted nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood.
         C.   The establishment of the conditional use will not impede the
normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses
permitted in the district.
         D.   Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary
facilities will be provided.
         E.   Adequate measures will be taken to provide ingress and egress so
designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
         F.   The conditional use shall in all other respects conform to the
applicable regulations of the districts in which it is located and the Board
shall find that there is a public necessity for the conditional use.
      (2)   Previously approved conditional uses, and any conditions associated
therewith, granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals for any particular parcel or
parcels of real property shall remain in effect for any additional development
or modifications on such real property. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear
and decide upon applications for the enlargement or extension of existing
conditional uses specifically listed in the district regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance. Where said enlargement or extension involves additional parcel or
parcels of real property not included in the original conditional use that was
granted, a new application must submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals and a
new hearing by the Board of Zoning Appeals must be held. Before authorizing the
issuance of the conditional use permit for such enlargement or extension to
additional parcels of real property, the Board may impose such conditions as
outlined in Chapter
1139  in whole or in part, as the Board deems necessary to carry out the intent
and purpose of this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 150506-22. Passed 5-6-15.)
   (e)    To grant essential services:
      (1)    To hear and decide upon applications for the erection,

but not limited to electrical, gas, steam, water, telephone, rail, sewage, air
or communication services, and the necessary buildings for the furnishing of
adequate services or used for the public health, safety or general welfare of
the City and its residents. The Board may impose such restrictions with respect
to use, design, landscaping, lot area, setback and height in lieu of the
district regulations in this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 760504-46. Passed 7-20-76.)
   (f)   (1)   Where the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that extraordinary
hardship may result from the strict compliance with the regulations as set out
in Chapters
1192  through
1195  and
1197  through
1199 , the Board may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be
done and the public interest secured; provided that such variation will not
have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations and
that the variation granted to overcome said extraordinary hardship will not be
substantially detrimental to the neighboring properties.
      (2)    In granting such variations and modifications in the above
referenced sections, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require such conditions as
will, in it's judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the requested
variation or modification in conjunction with minimizing the impact on the
neighboring properties or the overall objectives, standards and requirements of
the zoning district in which it sits.

1161.02 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)    The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map, which map is
designated as the District Map. The District Map and all notations, references
and other information shown thereon are a part of the Zoning Ordinance and have
the same force and effect as if the District Map and all the notations,
references and other information shown thereon were all fully set forth or
described herein, the original of which District Map is properly attested and
is on file with the Council Clerk.
   (b)    Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the appropriate
property line and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth
be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
   (c)    Territory annexed to the City after the effective date of the Zoning
Ordinance shall continue to be governed by the zoning regulations which
governed the territory annexed immediately prior to the annexation, as enacted
by a Board of County Commissioners under Ohio R.C. 303.01 to 303.25, or enacted
by a Board of Township Trustees under Ohio R.C. 519.02 to 519.25, as the case

acts within such 120 day moratorium.
(Ord. 810519-45. Passed 1-19-82.)

1161.03 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the District Map, the following rules apply:
   (a)    The district boundaries are either streets or alleys unless otherwise
shown, and where the districts designated on the Map are bounded approximately
by street or alley lines, the street or alley shall be constructed to be the
boundary of the district.
   (b)    Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where
the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines, and where the
districts designated on the District Map are bounded approximately by lot
lines, the lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts
unless the boundaries are otherwise indicated on the Map.
   (c)    In subdivided property, the district boundary lines on the Map shall
be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Map.

secured in place by a compression system installed on top of the trap assembly
and protected with a ballistic faceplate.
            2.   The material must have self-healing properties such that the
ballistic rubber self-heals the bullet's path after the round has penetrated
the surface so each bullet is encapsulated inside the ballistic rubber
material.
            3.   The trap assembly must encapsulate standard handgun and
frangible rounds and defeat armor piercing and non-armor piercing rounds, with
appropriate steel armor plate backing. The ballistic rubber surface should be
self-healing to 2,500 rounds distributed uniformly over the panel surface area
without eroding, deteriorating, or significantly distorting the surface.
            4.   Trap assembly should be modular in design to allow
installation to a wall structure or as a free-standing assembly.
            5.   Full trap assembly should provide a footprint depth of 20
inches (508 mm).
            6.   Formulated rubber ballistic material should be a mixture of
modified high density composite rubber based particles and bonding agents, cold
molded under high pressure to a minimum of 3,000 psi to form dimensionally
stable ballistic panels and blocks.

from the horizontal plane of the ceiling.
         E.   The baffles in a fixed position range must achieve a "no blue sky
design".
      (2)   Deflectors. Deflectors will be installed vertically or horizontally
to redirect wide angle shots into the backstop area and will be installed at a
25 degree angle either to the wall surface or floor, or be designed with an
approved ballistic rubber facing for encapsulating rounds.
      (3)   Shields.
         A.   Shields are to be installed above the firing line, to protect
ceiling areas.

barrier between shooters, restrict the travel of expended brass and act as a
spray shield when revolvers are used.
      (1)   Booth panels must be impenetrable by the bullet from any firearm
used on the range. (Panel must be capable of withstanding the impact of a
bullet fired at any angle to the surface and at point blank range. Recommended
construction of booth panel is 3/8" AR 500 steel plate covered with a nominal 2
inches of soft wood, or an approved ballistic rubber panel 2" thick.
      (2)   Booth panels must reduce muzzle blast effects on shooters and range
personnel, including the shooter occupying a booth. This can be accomplished by
special acoustical material.
      (3)   Booth panels must not restrict airflow.
      (4)   Booth panels must not restrict visibility of the firing line by the
range officer.
      (5)   Booth panels must extend from floor to at least 6 feet high,
preferably to the ceiling.
   (e)   Target Carriers –All indoor shooting ranges shall have a target
transport system in order to alleviate manual target retrieval.
   (f)   Sound Control – Sound control on indoor ranges include two distinct
components, sound levels within the range, and sound levels in adjoining,

nonconforming status and carry out the intent of the property owner or owners
in accordance with the submitted evidence.
 
   (c)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall insure, before granting an
extension of time, that such time extension will not be injurious to the use
and enjoyment of other property in the immediate neighborhood nor substantially
diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood and in all respects
will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort and
general welfare. The Board may impose such conditions as the Board deems

Board in granting conditional uses.

1199.02 COMPUTING PARKING SPACES.
   In computing the number of required off-street parking spaces the following
rules shall apply:
   (a)    "Floor area" means the gross floor area of the specific use,
excluding any floor or portion thereof used for parking, as herein defined.
   (b)    Where fractional spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
the nearest whole number.
   (c)    In the case of mixed uses, the parking spaces required shall equal
the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately.
   (d)    Whenever a building or use constructed or established after January
1, 1963 is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of
dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, parking spaces shall be provided
on the basis of the enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use existing
prior to January 1, 1963 is reconstructed or is enlarged to the extent of
twenty percent (20%) or more in floor area such building or use in its entirety
shall then and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth
herein. Any enlargement or change in use of less than twenty percent (20%) of
the gross floor area shall be provided with parking based on the enlargement or
change.
      (Ord. 711103-112. Passed 5-1-73.)
1199.03 LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   All parking spaces required herein shall be located as follows:
   (a)   The parking spaces required for residential buildings or uses shall be
located on the same lot with the building or use served. The parking spaces
required for any other building or use may be located on an area within 300
feet of the building and two or more owners of buildings may join together in
providing the required parking spaces. Where the required parking spaces are
not located on the same lot with the building or use served, the usage of the
lot or tract upon which such parking spaces are provided shall be restricted by
an instrument of record describing the premises for which the parking is
provided and assuring the retention of such parking so long as required by the
Zoning Ordinance.
      (Ord. 210601-37. Passed 9-7-21.)
1199.04 MINIMUM IMPROVEMENT AND MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   Parking lots and garages shall conform with the following improvement and
maintenance standards:
   (a)    Such lot shall be surfaced either with concrete not less than six
inches in thickness or with bituminous surface of not less than two inches in
depth on top of a compacted, crushed stone base not less than six inches in
depth, or with any surfacing which, in the opinion of the City Engineer, is
equal or superior to either of these types.
   (b)    Adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm water and
the City Engineer shall insure that such water shall not flow onto adjoining
property or adjacent sidewalks in a quantity or manner that would be
detrimental thereto, or an inconvenience to persons using the sidewalk.
   (c)    A structurally sound wall or other abutment approved by the City
Engineer to insure safety shall be installed around each side of the parking
lot wherever such lot adjoins a public street, sidewalk or alley. An adequate
retaining wall wherever necessary to prevent the washing of soil to and from
adjoining property and a wall or screen of such height and character as are
necessary for adequate screening of the parking lot from adjacent property
shall also be provided to meet requirements of the City Engineer.
   (d)    The location and width of entrances and exits to and from the lot or
garage shall be as determined by the City Engineer, but there shall not be more
than one entrance and one exit, or one combined entrance or exit, along any one
street unless same is deemed necessary by Council for the alleviation of
traffic congestion and interference of traffic movement along such street.
   (e)    The location of each parking space and the location and direction of
movement along the driveways providing access thereto shall be indicated by
painting upon the surface, by raised directional signs or markers or other
similar measures placed in the surfacing, where required by the City Engineer.
   (f)    Wherever the parking lots or garages are to be used during darkness,
a system of floodlighting shall be installed to provide an adequate standard of
illumination over the entire parking lot. All floodlights shall be shielded so
that minimum glare will extend to adjacent property and shall meet the
requirements of the City Engineer.
   (g)    A sign, the size and character of which shall be approved by the City
Engineer, shall be installed showing the ownership of the lot or garage and the
permitted use thereof. If the lot or garage is so operated that a charge is
made for the use of the parking facilities, the rates for parking shall be
legibly shown upon the sign.
   (h)    Landscape planting shall be installed on all parking lots and/or
adjacent to all garages. Such planting shall consist of at least one standard
tree of three inch diameter or more, for each ten parking spaces in the lot or
garage.
   (i)    A temporary shelter for the use of a parking lot attendant may be
maintained on the lot provided the location, construction and design of same
shall be first approved by the City Engineer.
   (j)    The parking lot or garage shall be maintained in a manner to keep it
as free as practicable from dust, paper and other loose particles, and snow and
ice shall be promptly removed by the operator. All adjacent sidewalks shall be
kept free from dirt, ice, sleet and snow and in a safe condition for use by
pedestrians. All signs, markers or any other methods used to indicate direction
of traffic movement and location of parking spaces shall be maintained in a
neat and legible condition. Likewise, any walls, trees and shrubbery, as well
as surfacing of the parking lot or garage shall be maintained in good condition
throughout its use for parking purposes unless and until proper maintenance,
repair or rehabilitation is completed.
   (k)    Any person operating a parking lot or garage shall either:
      (1)    File with the City a bond in such form as may be prescribed by the
Law Director and in such amount as required by Council which shall be surety
for any judgment for damages rendered against the operator of the parking lot,
resulting to person or property, when incurred while using the parking lot; or
      (2)    Carry public liability insurance in such amount as may be required
by Council.
(Ord. 711103-112. Passed 5-1-73.)
1199.05 OFF-STREET LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    There shall be provided at the time any building is erected or
structurally altered, off-street loading space in accordance with the following
requirements:
      (1)    Office buildings, apartments, apartment hotels, motels and hotels.
One space for each 5,000 to 50,000 square feet of gross floor area; two spaces
for each 50,000 to 200,000 square feet of gross floor area; one additional
space for each 75,000 square feet of gross floor area above 200,000 square

for each 75,000 square feet of gross floor area above 100,000 square feet.
      (3)    Manufacturing or industrial use. One space for each 10,000 square
feet of floor area or fraction thereof in excess of 5,000 square feet.
   (b)    In all cases where the off-street loading space is so located that a
truck must back directly from a major street into a loading space, a
maneuvering space of not less than fifty feet in length shall be provided on
the lot on which the industrial use is located.

1305.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Salem, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Salem has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
 
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Salem as identified in subsection (e) hereof, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City of Salem.
 
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Columbiana County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated April 5, 2006. Flood Insurance Rate Map Columbiana County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated April 5, 2006.
      (2)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Salem as required by Section
1305.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the offices of the Salem Utilities Superintendent
and/or the Salem City Service Director in the municipal building of the City of
Salem.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
 
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
 
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Salem, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
 
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 060207-10. Passed 2-7-06.)
1305.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See “Lowest Floor”.
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the City of Salem whose historic preservation program has been certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Salem Flood
Insurance Rate Map, September 27, 1985, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction”;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 060207-10. Passed 2-7-06.)
 
1305.03 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The Salem City Service
Director is hereby appointed to administer and implement these regulations and
is referred to herein as the Floodplain Administrator.
 
   (b)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The
duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include but
are not limited to:
      (1)   Evaluate applications for permits to develop in special flood
hazard areas.
      (2)   Interpret floodplain boundaries and provide flood hazard and flood
protection elevation information.
      (3)   Issue permits to develop in special flood hazard areas when the
provisions of these regulations have been met, or refuse to issue the same in
the event of noncompliance.
      (4)   Inspect buildings and lands to determine whether any violations of
these regulations have been committed.
      (5)   Make and permanently keep all records for public inspection
necessary for the administration of these regulations including Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Letters of Map Amendment and Revision, records of issuance and
denial of permits to develop in special flood hazard areas, determinations of
whether development is in or out of special flood hazard areas for the purpose
of issuing floodplain development permits, elevation certificates, variances,
and records of enforcement actions taken for violations of these regulations.
      (6)   Enforce the provisions of these regulations.
      (7)   Provide information, testimony, or other evidence as needed during
variance hearings.
      (8)   Coordinate map maintenance activities and FEMA follow-up.
      (9)   Conduct substantial damage determinations to determine whether
existing structures, damaged from any source and in special flood hazard areas
identified by FEMA, must meet the development standards of these regulations.
 
   (c)   Floodplain Development Permits. It shall be unlawful for any person to
begin construction or other development activity including but not limited to
filling; grading; construction; alteration, remodeling, or expanding any
structure; or alteration of any watercourse wholly within, partially within or
in contact with any identified special flood hazard area, as established in
Section
1305.01 (f), until a floodplain development permit is obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator. Such floodplain development permit shall show that
the proposed development activity is in conformity with the provisions of these
regulations. No such permit shall be issued by the Floodplain Administrator
until the requirements of these regulations have been met.
 
   (d)    Application Required. An application for a floodplain development
permit shall be required for all development activities located wholly within,
partially within, or in contact with an identified special flood hazard area.
Such application shall be made by the owner of the property or his/her
authorized agent, herein referred to as the applicant, prior to the actual
commencement of such construction on a form furnished for that purpose. Where
it is unclear whether a development site is in a special flood hazard area, the
Floodplain Administrator may require an application for a floodplain

in Section
1305.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Salem, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Salem have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
City’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Salem
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Salem suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Salem has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
 
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1305.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
 
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse.For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage”. The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other

Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
 
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
