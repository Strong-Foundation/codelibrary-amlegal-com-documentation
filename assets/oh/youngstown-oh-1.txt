Youngstown, of a permanent and general nature, should be recodified; and
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.

1995 Codified Ordinances are hereby attached to this Ordinance as Exhibit "A".
SECTION 2
   That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in Section 5
of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted
prior to January 1, 1995, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right of liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general ordinances of the
City, as codified therein, are correctly set forth and constitute the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Youngstown Ohio, 1995.
SECTION 5
   That this ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure necessary
for the immediate preservation of the public peace, safety and welfare of the
residents of the City of Youngstown for the reason that there exists an
imperative necessity for the adoption of the new Codified Ordinances in order
to facilitate the administration and daily operation of the City and to avoid
practical and legal entanglements; and provided it receives the affirmative
vote of six of the members elected to the legislative authority, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor;

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

The inhabitants of the City of Youngstown, as its limits now are, or may
hereafter be, shall continue to be a body politic and corporate, by name the
City of Youngstown, and as such shall have perpetual succession.
   It shall have all powers that now are, or hereafter may be granted to
municipalities by the Constitution or laws of Ohio; and all such powers,
whether expressed or implied, shall be exercised and enforced in the manner
prescribed by this Charter, or when not prescribed herein, in such manner as
shall be provided by ordinance or resolution of the Council. In the absence of
such provisions as to any power, such power shall be exercised in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by the general laws of the State, applicable to
municipalities.
   The reference herein to a person as he or him shall also include she or her.
(Amended November 4, 1986.)
   Section 2.
The enumeration of particular powers by this Charter shall not be held or
deemed to be exclusive, but in addition to the powers enumerated herein,
implied thereby or appropriate to the exercise thereof, the City shall have,
and may exercise all other powers which, under the Constitution and laws of
Ohio, it would be competent for this Charter specifically to enumerate.
   A Charter Review Committee will be convened by the Mayor every four (4)
years to review and consider recommending amendments to the Charter. (Amended
November 4, 1986.)

   The legislative power of the City, except as reserved to the people by this

utility, shall ever be so passed; nor shall any ordinance, resolution or any
other measure ever be passed providing for the levying or assessing of an

President or President Pro Tempore, and be presented forthwith to the Mayor by
the City Clerk. If the Mayor approves such ordinance or resolution, the Mayor
shall sign it within ten days after its passage or adoption by the Council,
but, if the Mayor does not approve it, the Mayor shall within ten days return
it, together with the Mayor’s objections, to the City Clerk, who shall transmit
the same to the Council at the next regular meeting thereof, which objections
the Council shall cause to be entered in full on its journal. The Mayor may
approve or disapprove the whole or any item or part of an ordinance or
resolution appropriating money. If the Mayor does not sign or disapprove an
ordinance or resolution after its passage or adoption, within the time
specified, it shall take effect in the same manner as if the Mayor had signed
it.
(Amended November 4, 2003)
   Section 14.
When the Mayor refuses to sign an ordinance or resolution, or part thereof, and
returns it to Council with his objections, the Council shall, after the
expiration of not less than one week, proceed to reconsider it; and, if upon
reconsideration, the ordinance or resolution, or part or item thereof,
disapproved by the Mayor, be approved by the Council by a two-thirds vote of
all members thereof; it shall take effect without the signature of the Mayor;
provided, however, that no ordinance or resolution providing for the
expenditure of more than Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars, which has been
disapproved by the Mayor, shall take effect after such reconsideration and
approval by such two-thirds vote, unless it shall be submitted by Council to a
referendum of the electors of the City at the next general election held
throughout the City, more than sixty (60) days thereafter, and be approved by a
majority of those voting thereon.
   Section 15.
Any ordinance or resolution providing for the expenditure of more than Five
Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars, which has been passed by Council, disapproved by
the Mayor, and reconsidered by Council, and approved by a two-thirds vote of
all members thereof, as provided in the preceding Section, may by resolution of
Council be submitted to a referendum of the electors of the City at the next
general election held throughout the City, more than sixty (60) days
thereafter; and, if approved by a majority of those voting thereon, shall take
effect upon the official determination of the result of such election.

Filing and Publication. Every ordinance or resolution, upon its final passage,
shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose, and shall be authenticated
by the signature of the City Clerk. Every ordinance or resolution of a general
nature, or providing for public improvements, or assessing property, shall,
upon its final passage, be promptly published one time in a newspaper of
general circulation throughout the City. In lieu of such publication the
Council may provide for the publication of a City Bulletin in which such
publication may be made and in which all other publications may be made which
are required by this Charter or the Revised Code.
   In the publication of an ordinance or resolution it shall be sufficient to

complete copy thereof is on file and may be seen at the office of the City
Clerk.

(Enacted November 2, 2004.)
   NOTE: Sections 36-B and 40-7.
PART-TIME WORKERS BILL OF RIGHTS
   Section 122.
Promoting a healthy, prosperous economy is important to the City of Youngstown
and to the quality of life for its residents. Part-time employment
opportunities that provide a dependable and predictable source of income are a
key element of such an economy, especially for those who need to need to
schedule and pay for child and elderly care. Treating part-time workers with
the same respect and dignity as those who work full-time is important to the
financial and emotional well-being of employees.
   In order to foster these kinds of desirable part-time employment
opportunities for its residents, the City hereby affirms the following:
economic productivity is increased when employers have access to a reliable,
trained and enthusiastic workforce; economic success is increased when
employees are invested in a positive outlook for their employer; employees
perform better when they can coordinate their work and personal schedules in
advance in order to adequately address work and personal responsibilities;
employees perform better when they can rely on a predictable source of income
with which to meet their financial obligations; and employees experience
greater job satisfaction when they feel their contributions to the employer are
valued equally to that of other employees, regardless of status as full-time or
part-time.
   For the purpose of establishing oversight and workplace standards that
support the productivity and economic success of employers and enhance the
ability of part-time employees to perform at their highest potential, the Part-
Time Workers' Rights Commission is hereby established. (Enacted November 8,
2016.)
   Section 123.
The Commission shall be composed of five (5) individuals who shall be appointed
by the City Council to serve without compensation. Appointments shall be for a
term of two years or until their respective successors shall have been
appointed and duly qualified. Such members shall be appointed in such manner as
to create staggered terms. If a vacancy occurs for any reason, the City Council
shall fill the unexpired term. Two members of the Commission shall be
representative of employers, two members shall be representative of part-time
employees, and one member shall represent the general public.
   For purposes of Sections
122 to
132, the following terms have the following meanings: "part-time" shall mean
employed on an hourly basis fewer than forty (40) hours per work week; "full-
time" shall mean employed for forty (40) or more hours per work week; and
"employer" shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, association,
labor organization, legal representative, mutual company, joint stock company,
trust, unincorporated organization, trustee, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver,
fiduciary and other organizations, including corporate officers or executives,
who directly or indirectly or through an agent or any other person, including
through the services of a temporary services or staffing agency or similar
entity, employ or exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions
of any individual.
(Enacted November 8, 2016)
   Section 124.

   1.    Advise and consult with the City Council on all matters involving
workplace policies and conditions for part-time employees.
   2.   Serve in an advisory and consultative capacity to the City Council to
assure effective compliance with fair part-time workplace policies and
requirements and recommend to the City measures aimed at improving the ability
of the City to promote equitable and practical working conditions for all part-
time employees.
   3.    Recommend to the City Council legislation to aid in programs designed
to comply with and further the purposes of Sections
122 to

of Sections
122 to
132. The Commission shall, upon the receipt of such complaints, investigate and

after using persuasion, mediation and conciliation in accordance with the rules
of the Commission as approved by the City Council in an attempt to provide
mutual understanding and satisfaction of the problem involved.
   5.    Enforce the workplace requirements under Sections
122 to
132 and make recommendations to the City Council for any amendments as may be
needed over time to promote the continued effective administration of these
sections.
   6.    Conduct research and obtain factual data to ascertain the status of
part-time employment in the City and periodically evaluate the impact and
effectiveness of the requirements of Sections
122 to
132.
   7.    Cooperate with all city, state, county, federal, and other
governmental agencies with resources helpful in achieving mutual appreciation
and support of the social and economic benefits of fair part-time employment
conditions and full utilization of human resources.
   8.    Employ staff as needed to effectively carry out its duties required
under this section. (Enacted November 8, 2016)
   Section 125.
An employer shall provide any part-time employee with a good faith estimate via
email or text message as well as in writing of the employees expected minimum
number of scheduled shifts and the days and hours of those shifts. This
estimate shall include on-call shifts, where "on-call" means any work shift for
which an employee must work on less than forty-eight (48) hours notice. The
estimate shall not constitute a contractual offer and the employer shall not be
bound by the estimate.
   An employer shall provide its part-time employees who request it with at
least two weeks' notice of their work schedules by doing either one of the
following at least every fourteen (14) days: posting the work schedule in a
conspicuous place at the workplace that is readily accessible and visible to
the requesting employees; or transmitting the work schedule by email or text,
so long as the requesting employees are given access to the electronic schedule
at the workplace.
   For part-time employees who request it, an employer shall provide the
employee on his or her first day of employment with an initial work schedule
that runs through the date that the next biweekly schedule for existing
employees is scheduled to be posted or distributed. For all requesting
employees, the work schedule shall include any on-call shifts, where
applicable.
   An employer my not require a part-time employee to be on-call, except for
one mutually agreed-to shift per week. Either party may cancel that shift
without repercussion or penalty as long as the cancellation occurs at least
(48) forty-eight hours before the on-call shift is to start.
   An employer shall provide a part-time employee notice of any change to the
employee's schedule that has been posted or transmitted pursuant to this
section. The employer shall provide such notice by email or text message as
well as in writing. This notice requirement shall not apply to any schedule
changes requested by the employee, such as employee-requested sick leave, time
off, shift trades, or additional shifts.
   The requirements of this section shall not apply under any of the following
circumstances.
   1.    When operations cannot begin or continue due to threats to employees
or property, or when civil authorities recommend that work not begin or
continue;
   2.    When operations cannot begin or continue because public utilities fail
to supply electricity, water, or gas, or there is a failure in a public utility
or sewer system; or
   3.    When operations cannot begin or continue due to an act of God or other
cause not within the employer's control.
   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an employer from
providing greater advance notice of part-time employees' work schedules and/ or
changes in schedules than that required by this section. (Enacted November 8,
2016.)
   Section 126.
Employers shall provide part-time employees with the same starting hourly wage
as that provided to starting full-time employees who hold jobs that require
equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar
working conditions. Pay differentials between part-time and full-time employees
are permissible if such differentials are based on reasons other than the part-
time status of the employee. This section shall not affect the minimum hourly
requirements for receipt of benefits including, but not limited to, health care
benefits.
   Employers shall provide part-time employees with proportional access to
employer-provided paid and unpaid time off, including sick leave, personal
leave and vacation leave, as that afforded to full-time employees for the same
job classification. A part-time employee's eligibility for employer-provided
paid or unpaid time off may be pro-rated based on
the number of hours that the part-time employee works.
   Employers shall provide part-time employees with the same eligibility for
promotions as that afforded to full-time employees for the same job
classification, provided that an employer may condition eligibility for
promotion on the employee's availability for full-time employment and on
reasons other than the part-time status of the employee, such as the nature and
amount of work experience.
   Employers shall provide part-time employees with the same pro-rated
eligibility for other benefits as that afforded to full-time employees for the
same job classification.
(Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 127.
The Commission shall publish and make available to employers, in any language
recognized by the City, a notice suitable for posting by employers in the
workplace informing part-time employees of their rights under Sections
122 to
132. Every employer that employs part-time employees shall post such notice at
its workplaces or job sites in conspicuous
locations to ensure that part-time employees are informed of their rights under
these sections.
(Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 128.
For a period of not less than three (3) years, employers shall retain
employment and payroll records pertaining to current and former part-time
employees.
(Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 129.
Any person who claims to have been injured by a violation of Sections
122 to
132 or who believes they will be irrevocably injured by a violation of these
sections that has occurred or is occurring may file a complaint with the
Commission. Any such complaint shall be filed within one hundred eighty (180)
days of the occurrence of an alleged violation, shall be in writing, shall
identify the person or entity alleged to have committed or alleged to be
committing a violation of these sections, and shall state the facts upon which
the allegations of a violation are based.
   Upon the filing of a complaint as herein provided, the Commission shall
cause to be made a prompt and full investigation of the matter stated in the
complaint. During or after the investigation, the Commission shall, if it
appears that a violation has occurred or is threatening to occur, attempt by
informal endeavors to effect conciliation, including voluntary discontinuance
of the violation and adequate assurance of future voluntary compliance with the
provisions of Sections
122 to
132.
   Upon completion of the investigation and informal endeavors at conciliation
by the Commission, but within thirty (30) days of the filing of the complaint
with the Commission, if the efforts of the Commission to secure voluntary
compliance have been unsuccessful, and if the Commission has made a
determination that a violation of Sections
122 to
132 has in fact occurred, such conclusion shall be submitted to the City Law
Director who shall make a determination regarding civil enforcement in the
Municipal Court of the City. If the Law Director decides to proceed with civil
enforcement, he or she shall institute such action within thirty (30) days
after such determination has been made, or as soon thereafter as practicable.
   If the Commission determines that there is not probable cause to believe
that a particular alleged or suspected violation of these sections has been
committed, the Commission shall take no further action with respect to that
alleged or suspected offense. In such case, the person filing the complaint
shall be notified by the Commission and informed of any alternate action they
may take, including appeal to the City Council.
(Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 130.
It shall be unlawful for any person to harass, threaten, harm, damage, or
otherwise penalize any individual, whistleblower, group, or business because
they have complied with the provisions of Sections
122 to
132, because they have exercised their rights under these sections or enjoyed
the benefits of these sections, or because they have made a charge, allegation,
testified, or assisted in any manner in any investigation, or in any proceeding
hereunder or have made any report to the Commission. A violation of this
section shall be subject to the penalty provisions of Section
131. (Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 131.
Any person or entity violating any provision of Sections
122 to
132 shall be subject to a civil penalty of one thousand ($1,000) dollars per
violation. If a person or entity is assessed three (3) such penalties in any
thirty-six (36) month period, the amount of the penalty for any subsequent
violations by such person or entity shall be increased to ten thousand
($10,000) dollars per violation for a period of five years. In any penalty
enforcement action, the violator shall also be liable for the attorneys' fees
of the City and the complainant. Each day a violation continues after the
passage of seventy-five (75) days from the date of the filing of the initial
complaint with the Commission shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.
Any person or entity violating any provision of Sections
122 to
132 may be enjoined by a suit filed by the City in a court of competent
jurisdiction, and this remedy is in addition to any penalty provision.
(Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   Section 132.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or work of
Sections
122 to
132, or any application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be
invalid or unconstitutional by a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction,
such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions or
applications of these sections. Sections
122 to
132 are cumulative in their legal effect and are not in lieu of any and all
other legal remedies which an aggrieved person may pursue. Nothing in Sections
122 to
132 shall be construed as limiting the rights and remedies that the law
otherwise provides to employees nor shall be interpreted or applied so as to
create any right, requirement, power, or duty in conflict with any federal or
state law. (Enacted November 8, 2016.)
   CONSTITUTIONALITY- That if any part or provision of Sections
20,
21,
22,
27,
31 to
36A inclusive, Sections
40-1 to
40-7 inclusive, Section
52 and Section
85 be declared unconstitutional or inoperative by the courts, this shall only
affect part or provision, the remainder of these amended Sections continuing in
full force and effect.

are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

   101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   109.01 PURPOSE.
   The achievement of good fiscal management for the City requires effective
cash management of nonimmediate funds which, in turn, depends on effective bank
management practices with respect to the investment and deposit of these funds.
(Ord. 87-253. Passed 5-27-87.)
   109.02 OBJECTIVES.
   The following investment and deposit objectives shall be applied in the
management of City funds:
   (a)   The primary objective of the City's investment activities is the
preservation of capital and the protection of investment principal.
   (b)   Those responsible for investing the City's public funds shall strive
to maximize the return on the portfolio but shall avoid assuming unreasonable
investment risks.
   (c)   The City's investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to
enable the City to meet operating requirements which might reasonably be
anticipated.
   (d)   The City's investments shall be diversified to avoid the assumption of
unreasonable and avoidable risks associated with specific types of securities
or individual financial institutions.
   (e)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of judgment
and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence,
discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs,
not for speculation but for investment, considering the probable safety of
their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   (f)   A factor in determining which depository should hold the City's public
funds shall be the City's desire to obtain the best possible banking service at
the lowest possible cost. (Ord. 87-253. Passed 5-27-87.)
   109.03 DEPOSITORY.
   All City deposits shall be concentrated in one central depository in order
to provide the City with greater leverage in obtaining banking services. (Ord.
87-253. Passed 5-27-87.)
   109.04 INVESTMENTS TO MATCH CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS.
   To the extent possible, the City's investments shall be made so as to
complement its anticipated cash flow requirements. Unless matched to a specific
cash flow requirement, investments in securities maturing more than one year
from date of purchase shall not be made. (Ord. 87-253. Passed 5-27-87.)
   109.05 SECURITIES PURCHASED.
   Securities shall be purchased only through financial institutions located

   All City funds deposited pursuant to Section
109.06(d) shall be secured by collateral pledged at the face value thereof in
an amount equal to at least one hundred percent (100%) of the deposit less the
amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal

eligible to be pledged as collateral:
   (a)   Bonds, notes or other obligations of the United States; or bonds,
notes or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the

interpretation or otherwise;
   (b)   Bonds, notes, debentures or other obligations or securities issued by
any Federal government agency or the Export-Import Bank of Washington, bonds,

and not by language appearing in the instruments specifically providing such
guarantee or pledge;
   (c)   Bonds and other obligations of this State;
   (d)   Bonds and other obligations of any county, township, school district,
Municipal corporation or other legally constituted taxing subdivision of this

   (e)   Bonds of other states of the United States which have not during the
ten years immediately preceding the time of such deposit defaulted in payments
of either interest or principal on any of their bonds. (Ord. 87-550. Passed 10-
7-87.)
   109.08 COLLATERAL DELIVERED TO DIRECTOR OF FINANCE OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.
   Any securities pledged as collateral pursuant to Section
109.07 shall be delivered either to the Director of Finance or to an

   109.09 SALE OF SECURITIES.
   If the depository fails to pay over any part of a deposit due the City, the
Director of Finance shall have the option of selling in the manner determined
by the Director any of the securities deposited pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter. If the bonds or other securities are on deposit with the Trustee,
the Director may request the Trustee to deliver to the Director any of the
securities so deposited and the Director shall have the option to sell such
securities in the manner determined by the Director. When a sale of securities
has been made, upon payment to the Director of the purchase money, the Director
shall transfer such securities to the purchaser whereupon the absolute
ownership of such securities shall pass to the purchaser. Any surplus remaining
after deducting the amount due the City and expenses of the sale shall be paid
to the depository. (Ord. 87-253. Passed 5-27-87.)
   109.10 SUBSTITUTION OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES.
   When a depository has deposited securities with the Trustee in accordance
with Section
109.08, the depository may substitute or exchange eligible securities having a
face value equal to or greater than the face value of the securities then on
deposit and for which they are to be substituted or exchanged only:
   (a)   If the Director of Finance gives written authorization for such
substitution or exchange.
   (b)   If the Director has authorized the depository to make such
substitution or exchange on a continuing basis during a specified period
without prior approval of each substitution or exchange. Written authorization
shall be sent to the Trustee stating that substitution may be made on a
continuing basis during a specified period under the conditions specified
therein; or
   (c)   If no continuing authorization for substitution or exchange has been
given by the Director, the depository shall notify the Director and the Trustee

for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their

Council and other members of the civil defense organization from civil defense
funds made available by Council. (1967 Code §97.04)

(Ord. 01-400. Passed 12-19-01.)
 
   (b)   Any employee suspected of abusing sick leave and/or showing a pattern

hourly rate more than the transferor, then the following equivalency factor
will apply: the transferee will receive leave time equivalent to the amount of
leave time earned by the transferor at the transferor’s rate of pay. The
transfer will be subject to the discretionary approval of the department head
and the Director of Finance. Both employees (i.e., the transferor and the
transferee) must also sign an affidavit that there was not nor will there be

effectuate this transfer of sick time accruals. An employee may be granted an

value of the employee’s accrued but unused sick leave at the employee’s current
hourly rate of pay at the time of termination, except that employees of the
Fire Department scheduled on a fifty-one hour work week who have accumulated
unused sick leave while so scheduled, shall be entitled to liquidate at the
rate of pay as above described at termination thirty-five percent (35%) of the
accumulated but unused sick leave at the rate of seventeen and two-tenths hours
for each twenty-four hours of unused sick leave accumulated.
   Payment for sick leave on this basis shall be considered to eliminate all
sick leave credit accrued and accumulated by the employee at that time.
   The Fire Department shall maintain separate records for purposes of
accumulation and accumulation for liquidation and shall, at the end of each
calendar year or upon termination or transfer, whichever occurs first, reduce

the illness from a licensed physician to justify the use of sick leave.
   Falsification of either a written, signed statement or a physician's
certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal.

days.
(Ord. 78-314. Passed 6-14-78; Ord. 99-223. Passed 6-2-99; Ord. 99-258. Passed

   163.10 ABSENCE DUE TO INJURIES RECEIVED IN COURSE OF EMPLOYMENT.
   All regular full-time salaried or hourly rated employees of the City injured
and incapacitated in the actual discharge of their duty, who as a result
thereof, are compelled to be absent from duty, shall be entitled to leave of
absence with pay subject to the following conditions:
   (a)   Injured on Duty Leave (IOD). Injured on duty leave (IOD) shall be
granted to any employee certified by the City as injured in the course and
scope of City employment. If, however, an employee files for Temporary Total
Disability Compensation (TT) or is working elsewhere during the time the
employee claims to be disabled from his/her City job, IOD benefits will
immediately stop.
   If, after a Bureau determination or the administrative appeals process,
whichever stage finalizes the process, it is found by the Bureau, the
Industrial Commission or a court that the claim is not related to the
employee's City of Youngstown job, the employee must reimburse the City for all
IOD used by any means available: accumulated sick leave, vacation or regular
biweekly pay deductions. The amount so used must be repaid within a twelve
(12)-month period.
   If the City does not certify a claim, the employee will be permitted to use
his/her sick leave or vacation which shall be reimbursed if, after a bureau
determination or the administrative appeals process, whichever stage finalizes
the process, it is found by the Bureau, Industrial Commission or a court that
the claim was incurred in the scope of City of Youngstown employment.
   Any employee granted IOD will be required to apply for, attend and fully
cooperate with the Workers' Compensation Rehabilitation Program.
   After every thirty (30) days of IOD, up to the first ninety (90) days, the
City may request that the employee undergo a medical review at the City's
expense. After ninety (90) days, this review may be requested every three (3)
months. The doctor will be mutually agreed to between the City and the
employee. If, however, an agreement on a doctor is not reached within fourteen
(14) days, the City and the employee agree that an alternate striking method
from a list of specialists in the area of the employee's disability will be
used to determine a doctor. This medical review will be used to grant or deny a
request for continued IOD. If the physician determines that the employee is
unable to work in any status, IOD shall be continued. If the employee is able
to work in a "light duty" status, the City will provide work within his or her
own department, if available.
   If the physician determines that the employee is able to return to work, the
employee may return to work or apply to Workers' Compensation for TT, in no
event will the City continue to pay IOD or any other benefit after a doctor's
determination that the employee is fit for work and the employee does not
return to work.
   All benefits for those off-duty on IOD, including IOD, will be continued for
up to 365 non-consecutive days (including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) in
an eighteen (18)-month period from the date of injury if all requirements above
are met. After that period, an employee unable to return to work can file for
Workers' Compensation TT, but will not continue to be eligible for City
benefits, including sick or vacation accrual. Hospitalization benefits for an
employee who has exhausted IOD but is unable to return to work will be
continued for another 365 days so long as that employee continues to provide
the City with doctor's reports stating that he is unable to return to work at
least every three (3) months.
   The City reserves the right to recoup benefit payments to any employee who
is guilty of submitting a false claim or abuse of the privilege covered in this
section, or working for another employer while on injury leave, and to take
disciplinary action. Examples of what might constitute “abuse” as used in this
section, include an employee’s refusal to perform the duties associated with
his/her transitional work duty assignment, failure to comply with the terms
outlined in this section, etc.
   If the employee is able to work in a light duty or transitional work
assignment, the City will provide work within the department, if available. An
employee working in a transitional assignment will be compensated at their
regular rate of pay. The Worker’s Compensation Rehabilitation Program shall
specify, as part of an affected employee’s rehabilitation program, the date
upon which an employee in the program may fully resume his or her normal work
duties. Upon an employee’s resumption of his or her normal work duties, the
affected employee’s transitional work assignment shall be terminated. A light
duty or transitional work assignment shall not exceed two (2) months, unless
mutually agreed to by both the employee and the City.
   The department or division head, in conjunction with the selected
rehabilitation case manager, shall identify whether a transitional work
assignment is available. However, it is not the intent of this section to
require a department or division to provide transitional work above that
identified nor is a department or division required to provide transitional
work where no such appropriate tasks have been identified and recognized.
   A City employee who declines to take part in a City’s transitional work
program subsequent to a work-related injury shall be ineligible for any form of
transitional work duties as otherwise contemplated herein. The City shall be
under no obligation to identify potential transitional duties in any such case
and its failure to do so shall not be construed by the employee as unequal or
disparate treatment of the employee under the terms of this labor agreement.
   (b)   Employee Responsibility.
      (1)   The injured employee shall immediately report an injury received on
duty to supervision. The report shall be filed during the tour of duty on the
date the injury is received and shall be on forms issued by the Law Department.
      (2)   Thereafter within no less than three (3) days of the injury, the
injured employee shall report the injury to the Law Department and shall timely
complete all forms designated by the Law Department pertaining to injuries
received during the actual performance of duty.
      (3)   Failure to report an injury on duty within the prescribed time
periods shall render the employee ineligible for injured-on-duty leave.
      (4)   The filing requirements, as above described, may be waived by the
Law Department with the injury received physically prevents the employee from
filing or when circumstances surrounding the injury require a waiver in the
interest of justice.
      (5)   The employee shall cause a certified physician to file a written
report with the Law Department on Law Department forms, which report shall
contain a description and diagnosis of the injury and a prognosis which shall
include the nature and extent of any disability, the type of duty the employee
may perform while under such disability and an estimate of the length of time
necessary for recovery and return to duty.
The failure to receive the above-described physician's report will be
sufficient cause to deny or terminate injured-on-duty leave.
   (c)   Dispute Settlement. All disputes concerning injured-on-duty leave
status of an employee shall be referred to the Law Department for resolution.
The Law Director, successor or designee shall schedule and convene an informal
hearing, if requested within thirty (30) days and shall determine the resolve
all questions after the presentation of evidence by the employee. Failure or
refusal to present evidence by the employee shall foreclose their right to
present the evidence.
   The decision of the Law Department shall be final. Additional remedies
provided by law shall not be abrogated by this provision.

   163.19 VACATIONS.
   Effective January 1, 2002, each full-time employee of the City, including
full-time hourly rated employees, shall be granted the following paid vacation
leave, dependent upon the employee earning and accruing such time:
 
After one (1) year of service            2 weeks
After five (5) years of service          3 weeks
After eleven (11) years of service       4 weeks
After seventeen (17) years of service    5 weeks
After twenty-three (23) years of service 6 weeks
   Effective January 1, 2002, prior employment with the City of Youngstown may
be used to compute the first full year of employment, in accordance with Ohio
Revised Code Section 9.44, as amended on October 25, 1995, and the anniversary
date of the employee shall be the anniversary date of the attainment of the
first full year of employment with the City.
   A full-time employee is an employee regularly scheduled on a forty hour
week, or in excess thereof, inclusive of lunch period and exclusive of
employees serving on a temporary, special or seasonal basis.
   The City will continue to utilize a “use-it-or-lose-it” vacation policy.
Employees must complete one (1) year of service before being eligible for
vacation leave. Upon completion of this one year of service, the employee will
be entitled to utilize a pro-rated amount of vacation from the initial hire
date to December 31 of the initial hire year. This pro-rated amount will be
determined by the vacation hours earned from the employee’s date of hire to
December 31 of the initial hire year. Effective January 1 of the succeeding
year, the employee will be eligible to take the earned amount of vacation as
outlined in the first paragraph of this section. Thereafter, the employee’s
anniversary date shall be January 1 of said anniversary year.
   Employees hired prior to January 1, 2001, shall have January 1 of each year
as their anniversary date for vacation purposes.
   Employees in the last year of employment must earn the vacation for that
year, i.e., pro- rated to date of termination.
   Officers and employees in the various departments of the City not included
in any bargaining unit, therefore, designated as Management, cannot carry over
from one calendar year to the next any vacation benefit. Any vacation accrual
will be lost if it is not used before December 31 of the year of entitlement.
   Vacation earned and accrued during an earning period is required to be taken
during the next succeeding vacation period unless deferred by the express
written permission of the department head or otherwise deferred by appropriate
law, ordinance or statute.
   Determination of preference as to time of taking vacation shall include
primary consideration based on seniority of the employee within the department
or division in which employed and the needs and requirements of the City to
maintain efficient service.
   Employees of the City on sick leave or injured-on-duty leave at the
conclusion of a vacation period who have been unable to take their vacation
within the prescribed period shall be entitled to carry over such vacation to
the succeeding vacation period, providing, however, that the department head
may require that such vacation shall be taken after the employee has returned
to regular duty without reference to any seniority roster.
   Vacation credits may be earned while an employee is on sick leave or
injured-on-duty leave, providing, however, that an employee injured on duty and
absent from duty as a result of such injury for one full consecutive year
receiving full pay for such period is presumed to have been compensated for all
vacation leave and holiday leave due during such absence.
   Upon retirement or voluntary termination of service, an employee of the City
is entitled to receive compensation for all vacation credits earned and due at
the rate of pay being received by the employee at the date of separation from
service.
   In the determination of the length of vacation leave due employees of the
City, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall be excluded from the computation
and such days shall not be computed as vacation days unless employees are
receiving compensation or additional time off in lieu of the vacation days.
   All vacation leave shall be taken only with the prior authorization and
approval of the department head. (Ord. 01-408. Passed 12-19-01.)

   163.48 MANAGEMENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM.
   (a)   Purpose; Notice.
      (1)   The City of Youngstown has a legal responsibility and management
obligation to ensure a safe work environment, as well as paramount interest in
protecting the public by ensuring that its employees have the physical stamina
and emotional stability to perform their assigned duties. A requirement for
employment must be an employee who is free from drug dependence, illegal drug
use or drug and alcohol abuse.
      (2)   Liability could be found against the City and the employee if the
City fails to address and ensure that employees can perform their duties
without endangering themselves or the public.
      (3)   There is sufficient evidence to conclude that use of illegal drugs,
the misuse of drug and drug, or alcohol dependence seriously impairs an
employee’s performance and general physical and mental health. The illegal
possession and use of drugs and narcotics by employees is a crime in this
jurisdiction and clearly unacceptable.
      (4)   Further, the magnitude of harm and risk are increased where
employees carrying out safety sensitive functions are impaired. Thus, those
personnel occupying safety-sensitive positions are subject to greater scrutiny
for the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of drugs or alcohol.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   “Employee” means all personnel employed by the City. “Safety-
sensitive Employee” means those personnel occupying positions where the
essential functions of the position involve the discharge of duties fraught
with risks of injury to others such that a momentary lapse of attention can
have disastrous consequences.
      (2)   “Safety sensitive functions” means all time an employee is at work
or required to be in readiness for work.
      (3)   “Reasonable suspicion” means an apparent state of facts,
circumstances or information which exists from an inquiry by the supervisor or
from a creditable source which would induce a reasonably intelligent and
prudent person to believe the employee was under the influence or using drugs/
narcotics.
   (c)   General Rules.
      (1)   Employees shall not take any narcotics or dangerous substances
unless prescribed by a person licensed to practice medicine. Employees who are
required to take prescription medicine shall notify their immediate supervisors
of the medication prescribed and the nature of the illness or injury. Any
statutory defined illegal use of drugs by an employee, whether at or outside
City employment, shall not be tolerated.
      (2)   All property belonging to the City is subject to inspection at any
time without notice as there is no expectation of privacy. Property includes,
but is not limited to, City-owned vehicles, desks, containers, files and
storage lockers.
      (3)   Employees who have reasonable basis to believe that another
employee is illegally using drugs or narcotics shall report the facts and
circumstances immediately to their supervisor.
      (4)   Failure to comply with the intent or provisions of this section may
be used as grounds for disciplinary action. Refusal by an employee to take the
required drug test or follow the regulations prescribed in this section shall
result in immediate relief from City duties pending disposition of any
administrative personnel action.
   (d)   Policy - Drug Testing and Alcohol Testing.
      (1)   Pre-Employment Testing. All prospective appointees for any safety-
sensitive position in the City will be routinely tested for drug or narcotic
usage. The testing procedure and safeguards set forth in this section shall be
followed. Applicants testing positive for drugs or refusing a drug test shall
not be hired.
      (2)   Reasonable Suspicion Testing.
         A.   Reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol testing will be required
if a supervisor or management person has reasonable suspicion to believe that
an employee is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, using illegal drugs, or
had a substance abuse problem. Employees to be tested under reasonable
suspicion shall be driven to the test site by a supervisor.
         B.   A supervisor who orders a drug or alcohol test when there is a
reasonable suspicion of the use of alcohol or any drug or narcotic shall
forward a report containing the facts and circumstances directly to the
department head. The employee shall be verbally advised of any applicable
reasonable suspicion at the time of the test and receive a written statement of
the same reasonable suspicion within twenty-four (24) hours of the test.
      (3)   Post-Accident Testing.
         A.   Post-accident testing for drugs and alcohol will be required
after accidents occurring while an employee is carrying out safety sensitive

chances of being selected are the same.
   
   (e)   Return to Duty Testing and Follow-Up Testing. Any employee who tests
positive on a drug or alcohol test must be evaluated, treated and must
successfully complete a drug or alcohol treatment program and be given a return

      (9)   Any employee shall upon written request have access to any records
relating to his or her drug test.

problems with the misuse of alcohol and drugs and provided with a list of
substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs.
      (3)   The covered employee must be evaluated by a substance abuse
professional (SAP) to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs;
must follow any rehabilitation program prescribed; must be evaluated to

a determination that he has successfully complied with an education and/or
treatment program, must pass a return to duty alcohol or drug test.
   (j)   Discipline.
      (1)   Employees who have tested positive on a drug and/or alcohol test
shall be subject to disciplinary action. If the employee agrees to enter and

required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and in
conformity with Chapter 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 382 Et. Seq.
(Ord. 98-316. Passed 8-11-98.)
   163.50 FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA) POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Basic Leave Requirement.
      (1)   Employees shall be entitled to up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid
leave during a "twelve (12)-month period," subject to subsection (c)(2), and
other requirements set forth herein, for:
         A.   The birth of a son or daughter and to care for such child;
         B.   The placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster
care;
         C.   To care for a spouse, son, daughter under the age of eighteen or,
if over eighteen, incapable of self-care, or parent who has a "serious health
condition;" or
         D.   A serious health condition which makes the employee "unable to
perform the functions of the employee's job."
      (2)   The twelve (12)-month period is a "rolling" period measured
backwards from the date an employee wishes to use FMLA leave (i.e., we will
measure backwards starting with a period beginning twelve (12) months prior to
the date leave commences and count how many weeks of leave that employee has
had including sick, vacation, injured on duty, workers compensation, personal
days, etc. A person who has already used nine (9) weeks of leave in that twelve
(12) month period will be eligible for only three (3) more weeks under the
FMLA).
   The City will count time off for a qualifying FMLA event against the twelve
(12) week period when informed by an employee or his/her immediate family
representative that the employee is off work for a qualifying event whether or
not the employee requests FMLA leave.
      (3)   Spouses both working for the City are limited to a combined twelve
(12) weeks of leave for birth, adoption/foster care and to care for a parent.
      (4)   A person must have been an employee of the City for at least twelve
(12) months before being eligible for any FMLA leave and must have actually
worked at least 1,250 hours in the preceding twelve (12) month period before
being eligible for any FMLA leave. "Actually worked" does not include hours on
sick, worker's compensation, injured-on-duty, maternity, civil service leave of
absence, vacation or any other leaves.
      (5)   The City requires an employee who is taking time off, whether paid
or unpaid, for a FMLA qualifying event as outlined below to notify his/her
immediate supervisor of the reason for the absence from work. The filing of a
lost time claim with the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation will be considered
notification by an employee that any subsequent absence is a FMLA qualifying
event.
   (b)   Serious Health Condition.  
      (1)   A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment, or
physical or mental condition that involves:
         A.   Inpatient care and a period of "incapacity," or
         B.   "Continuing treatment" by a health care provider and includes:
            1.   A period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive days
that involves:
               a.   Treatment two (2) or more times by a health care provider;
or
               b.   One (1) treatment by a health care provider which results
in a "regimen of continuing treatment."
            2.   Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal
care.
            3.   Any period of incapacity due to a "chronic serious health
condition."
         C.   A serious health condition does not include cosmetic treatment,
the "common cold," flu, earaches, upset stomach, minor ulcers and headaches
unless inpatient hospital care is required or complications arise.
         D.   Absences due to an employee's use of alcohol or drugs are not
covered, duty absences for treatment of substance abuse are covered.
      (2)   "Regimen of continuing treatment" includes a course of prescription
medication or therapy requiring special equipment but does not include taking
over-the-counter medication, drinking fluids, exercise and similar activities
that can be initiated without visiting a health care provider.
      (3)   "Chronic serious health condition" is one which requires periodic
visits for treatment, continues over and extended period of time and may cause
episodic periods of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy).
   (c)   Procedure for Leave.
      (1)   Employee's notice obligations.
         A.   Employees must give thirty (30) days advance notice or "such
notice as is practicable" for any leave which is to qualify for FMLA time.
         B.   If an employee fails to give notice of the reason for an FMLA
qualifying leave within two (2) business days after returning to work from the
leave, the leave is not FMLA protected.
         C.   Employees will be required to comply with the department's usual
and customary notice requirements for requesting leave (e.g., written notice)
and will be required to provide documentation supporting the reasons for the
FMLA leave (doctor's certification).
         D.   The employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatments
so that they do not unduly disrupt the department's operations and the employee
may be reassigned, at the City's discretion, to an alternative position that
better accommodates intermittent leave for treatment purposes (that is, leave
that is required for periods of less than one (1) day).
         E.   The employee's failure to notify the City of the FMLA-qualifying
reason for leave may result in the City designating the leave as FMLA leave
retroactively or denying the leave as FMLA leave.
      (2)   Substitution of accrued leave.
         A.   THE CITY REQUIRES THAT THE EMPLOYEE MUST SUBSTITUTE THE FOLLOWING
ACCRUED PAID LEAVE FOR UNPAID FMLA LEAVE IF THE EMPLOYEE HAS THE FOLLOWING
AVAILABLE:
            1.   Accrued pad vacation or personal leave,
            2.   Accrued paid sick or other medical leave,
            3.   PLEASE NOTE: ALL sick, workers' compensation, injured on duty,
maternity, civil service leave of absence, vacation, or any other leaves taken
for an FMLA qualifying condition WILL COUNT toward the twelve-week period for
FMLA leave calculation.
      (3)    Certification of a serious health condition.
         A.   Procedure:
            1.   The City must have a doctor's certification of an employees
need for FMLA leave.
               a.   If an employee gives thirty (3) days advance notice,
certification is due before leave commences.
               b.   If advance notice is not possible, employee will be given
not more than fifteen (15) calendar days on commencement of leave to provide
certification.
               c.   If leave is requested for periods of time of less than
three (3) calendar days and sick leave is used, the applicable ordinance or
contract notification applies.
               d.   The City or its representative may contact the employee's
health care provider to clarify to confirm the validity of the certification.
            2.   The City may request a second opinion if there is reason to
doubt the certification. An employee is not entitled to pay for time spent
obtaining certification or second opinion.
         B.   A fitness-for-duty certificate may be required before an employee
returns to work after leave due to an employee's serious health condition upon
the discretion of the department head.
   (d)   Benefits.
      (1)   Employees using sick, vacation, personal day, injured on duty,
etc., are subject to valid ordinance and/or contractual provisions.
      (2)   Employees using unpaid leave shall be considered to be "off the
payroll" for that period and shall receive no benefits which would otherwise
accrue if the employee was working or on paid leave, except as provided below.
         A.   Hospitalization coverage will be provided to an employee on an
FMLA leave only to the completion of twelve (12) week period (i.e., the
employee who has used nine (9) weeks of paid leave in nine (9) months and has
one week of vacation will be allowed two (2) week of FMLA unpaid leave and
hospitalization will continue for these two (2) weeks).
         B.   An employee who exhausts FMLA but goes on a civil service or
contractual leave of absence will not receive City-paid hospitalization
benefits but will be subject to the rules and regulations of COBRA.

      (1)   Submission to such conduct is made, either explicitly or
implicitly, a term or condition of the individual's employment;
      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individuals; or
      (3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonable interfering
with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or
offensive work environment.
   (b)   The City of Youngstown is committed to establishing and maintaining a
work atmosphere that is free from sexual harassment and other types of illegal
discrimination. Accordingly, the City of Youngstown adopts and reaffirms its
commitment to no-discrimination on the basis of sex, including the prohibition
of sexual harassment and retaliation in the workplace. Department heads shall
take prompt action to address and process complaints of sexual harassment,
including retaliation complaints, by consulting with the City Law Department.
   (c)   The City of Youngstown is committed to a prompt response based upon a
thorough investigation whenever:
      (1)   An employee alleges that sexual harassment, intimidation or
discrimination is taking place;
      (2)   A supervisor observes something which may constitute sexual
harassment; or
      (3)   A department head or the Law Department receives information
concerning an possible instance of sexual harassment.
   (d)   Any employee who believes that he/she is a victim of sexual harassment
should immediately report such incident(s) to his/her department head within 15
working days of the incident which gave rise to the complaint. If it is
inappropriate for the complainant to address the complaint to his/her
department head (e.g., if the department head is the employee accused of the
harassing conduct), then the complaint shall be addressed directly to the City
Law Department. An employee may also file a formal complaint with the City of
Youngstown Human Relations Commission (HRC) within six (6) months of the
alleged act(s), the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (OCRC) within six (6) months
of the alleged act(s) or the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC) within three hundred (300) days of the alleged act(s).
   (e)   Sexual Harassment Internal Investigation Procedure.
      (1)   The information alleging sexual harassment or improper behavior
shall be given to a Department Head and the City Law Department.
      (2)   The City Law Department shall:
         A.   Notify the person accused of engaging in improper activity that
the issue has been brought to the attention of the City Law Department; and
         B.   Notify the person bringing forth the issue that a prompt
investigation will be conducted by an individual employed outside of the
accused's department, to be selected by the City Law Department.
      (3)   The investigator will:
         A.   Conduct an interview with the person who brought the matter to
the attention of management;
         B.   Interview the person who is alleged to have engaged in the
improper activity. That person will be given an opportunity to explain his/her
recollection of the matter, along with any other information which that person
wishes to provide;
         C.   Interview persons who have been identified as having some
relevant information concerning any aspect of the occurrence(s);
         D.   Prepare written statements containing the information obtained in
each interview. This information will be provided to each person interviewed.
The person interviewed will be asked to review the accuracy and completeness of
the statement and return a signed copy to the investigator.
         E.   Once the facts have been gathered, report the information to the
department head, unless the department head is the accused employee in which
case the information will be presented to the Mayor or his designee;

Mayor or his designee to implement the appropriate course of action in
accordance with all applicable laws and labor union contracts.

All employees will be expected to comply with this policy and take appropriate
measures to ensure that such conduct does not occur. Appropriate disciplinary
action, up to and including termination, will be taken against any employee who
violates this policy against sexual harassment. Because an accusation of sexual
harassment can have a serious effect on innocent individuals, disciplinary
action up to and including termination will be taken against any employee who
knowingly reports a false accusation of sexual harassment. However,
determination by the City that an incident of sexual harassment did not take
place does not mean that the reporting employee will be subject to discipline.
   (g)   The City of Youngstown prohibits and will not tolerate retaliation or
intimidation directed toward anyone who complains of sexual harassment.
   (h)   The determination of the issue and any action taken against any
involved party will be communicated in writing to all persons involved.

shall be kept on file in the City Law Department.

   163.62 WHISTLEBLOWER POLICY.
   (a)   The City of Youngstown requires all officers and employees to observe
the highest standard of professionalism and ethics in the conduct of their
duties and responsibilities. All officers and employees of the City of
Youngstown ("City") must comply with all City policies, fulfill their duties
and responsibilities with honesty and integrity, and comply with all ordinances
and state and federal laws and regulations.
 
   (b)   The City of Youngstown officers and employees have the responsibility
to report suspected violations of all City policies, ordinances, state and
federal laws and regulations. Prior to reporting potential violations, officers
and employees shall have a good faith belief that potential violations have
occurred. Anyone reporting a violation must be acting in good faith and have
reasonable grounds for believing that the information disclosed indicates a
violation.
 
   (c)   The City is committed to protecting individuals who make good faith
reports of suspected or actual wrongful conduct or who refuse to partake in
wrongful conduct. This policy is intended to encourage and enable officers and
employees to report suspected violations without any adverse employment
consequences. Officers and employees of the City are prohibited from taking
retaliatory action against an employee that has reported in good faith
potential violations of the law or City policies. Retaliatory action includes
but is not limited to demotion, failure to promote, harassment, reduction in
job duties, and imposition of unwarranted discipline. Any officer or employee
who retaliates against someone for reporting a violation in good faith is
subject to discipline, up to and including termination.
 
   (d)   Officers and employees should promptly notify the employee's
supervisor when the employee becomes aware that a suspected violation has
occurred. If any employee is not comfortable talking with his or her
supervisor, or if after talking with his or her supervisor, the employee
continues to have reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred that
is not being adequately addressed, the employee shall report the violation to
the Human Resources Manager or the City of Youngstown Law Director, who shall
then be responsible for directing the complaint to the appropriate department.
 
   (e)   Once reported, the complaining officer or employee shall then file
with the employee's supervisor, the Human Resources Manager and/or the City Law
Director, a written report that provides sufficient detail to identify and
describe the violation. All reports will be promptly investigated and
appropriate corrective action taken if warranted by such investigation.
 
   (f)   To the extent possible, reports of violation, and investigation
pertaining to such violations, shall be kept confidential consistent with the
need to conduct an adequate investigation. Interference with an investigation
by disclosure of reports of violations to individuals not involved in the
investigation will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense and may result
in discipline up to and including termination. Likewise, any allegations that
prove to be false, and that prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly,
will be viewed as a serious offense requiring disciplinary action up to and
including termination.
 
   (g)   All City of Youngstown officers and employees must read the
Whistleblower Policy, agree to adhere to its requirement and agree not to
retaliate against any employee who has reported wrongful conduct in accordance
with the Whistleblower Policy.
(Ord. 15-10. Passed 2-4-15.)
   163.63 VIOLENCE AND BULLYING IN THE WORKPLACE POLICY.
   (a)    The City of Youngstown is committed to maintaining a workplace that

psychological aggression.

rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and preventing one from

   (c)   Many situations, if investigated and responded to before they become
serious, can be diffused before they result in violence or damage to an
employee's health or career. Any employee can report concerns or incidents to a
supervisor, the Human Resources Manager or the City Law Director. In addition,
where appropriate, an employee may contact security personnel and/or the
Youngstown Police Department.

treated with courtesy and respect at all times. The City strictly prohibits the
possession of weapons (excepting those individuals permitted by law) and/or the
use of violence or threats of violence in the workplace and views such actions
very seriously. Conduct that constitutes real or perceived threats, threatening
behavior, verbal abuse, intimidation or coercion, harassment, menacing
behavior, stalking, injury to persons or property or acts of violence to
another employee, customer, vendor or other individuals will not be tolerated.
 
   (e)   Any person who makes substantial threats, exhibits threatening
behavior, or engages in violent acts on City premises shall be removed from the
property as quickly as safety permits, and may be asked to remain away from
City premises pending the outcome of an investigation into the incident.
Persons who commit these acts outside the workplace but involve work related
activities are also violating this policy.
 
   (f)   When reporting a threat or incident of violence, the employee should
be as specific and detailed as possible. Employees should not place themselves
in peril. The City encourages employees to bring their disputes to the
attention of their supervisors or the Human Resources Manager before the
situation escalates. The City will not discipline employees for reporting good
faith concerns.
 
   (g)   If a supervisor becomes aware of any action, behavior or perceived
threat that may violate this policy, the supervisor is responsible for
immediately contacting the Department Head,
Human Resources Manager, and the City Law Director.
 
   (h)   The City will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of
threats of violence or incidents of actual violence and of suspicious
individuals or activities. The identity and confidentiality of the individual
making a report will be protected as much as possible. To maintain workplace
safety and the integrity of its investigation, the City may suspend employees
suspected of workplace violence or threats of violence, either with or without
pay, pending investigation. If it is determined that threatening behavior has
been exhibited or acts of violence were committed, the City will initiate an
appropriate response. Anyone found to be responsible for threats of or actual
violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be
subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including termination of
employment.
 
   (i)   Employees should promptly inform the Human Resources Manager of any
protective or restraining order that they have obtained that lists the
workplace as a protected area. Employees are encouraged to make good faith
reports of safety concerns with regard to intimate partner violence. The City
is committed to supporting victims of intimate partner violence.
 
   (j)   This policy prohibits retaliation in any form against an employee who
in good faith brings a complaint of violence, intimidation, bullying and/or
harassment. However, any allegations that prove to be false, and that prove to
have been made maliciously or knowingly, will likewise be viewed as a serious
offense subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. (Ord.
15-11. Passed 2-4-15.)

conditions of his/her particular plan. The employee will be required to

within allotted minutes, costs, etc. shall result in progressive discipline and
may result in loss of cellular equipment.
      (9)   The City retains the right to review, audit and/or monitor cell
phone use at any time and notify the Employee's Department Head/Supervisor of

paying, in lieu of the tax measured as above provided, a tax of two and three-
quarter percent (2 3/4%) of the taxpayer's payroll paid during the taxable

rented, managed by taxpayer individually or through agents or other
representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in
part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per

   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Director of
Finance each employer within or doing business within the City shall deduct at

the tax of two and three-quarter percent (2 3/4%) of the gross salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee, less the
credit provided by Section
181.15, and shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close
of each calendar quarter make a return and pay to the Director the amount of
taxes so deducted. Such returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Director and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor by the Director. Such employer shall be liable for the
payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such
taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and such tax collected by such employer from his employees
shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands
of such employer.
   (c)   Such employer who deducts the tax in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) or more in the first or second month of a calendar quarter shall, on
or before the twentieth day of the following month, pay to the Director of
Finance the amount of taxes deducted. Such employer who deducts the tax in the
amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more in the third month of a
calendar quarter shall, on or before the last day of the following month, pay
to the Director the amount of taxes so deducted.
   (d)   Such employer who makes such payments on a monthly basis only for the
first two months of a calendar quarter shall pay such taxes deducted for the
third month of a calendar quarter at the regular time for filing the employer's
quarterly return of income tax withheld. Such employer who, at his option,
makes such payment for the third month of a calendar quarter on or before the
twentieth day of the following month, shall have until the twentieth day of the
second month following the close of each calendar quarter to file said
employer's quarterly return of income tax withheld.
   (e)   Such payments shall be on form or forms furnished by or obtainable
upon request from the Director of Finance, setting forth the amount of tax
deducted for the month. A receipted copy of such form shall be returned to the
employer, to be attached to and filed with the employer's quarterly return of
income tax withheld.
(Approved by voters 11-5-02.)
   (f)   (1)   Every employee of an employer having control or supervision of
or charged with the responsibility of:
         A.   Deducting and withholding tax, and/or
         B.   Filing the returns and making payment to the Director of Finance
as required by this section, and
      (2)   Any officer or trustee of an employer who is responsible for the
execution of the employer's fiscal responsibilities, shall be personally liable
for the employer's failure to deduct and withhold tax, file any return, and/or
pay any tax due as required by this section. A person described in the previous
sentence shall be referred to herein as "responsible person." The dissolution,
termination, or bankruptcy of an employer does not discharge a responsible
person's liability for a failure of the employer to deduct and withhold taxes,
file returns and/or pay taxes due as required by this section.
(Ord. 95-304. Passed 8-16-95.)
   181.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
181.03 shall file a declaration setting forth the estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. Every person filing an estimate for the year
is required to have at least eighty percent (80%) paid of the actual tax due
for the year, through quarterly installments due as follows. Provided, however,
if a taxpayer's income is wholly from wages from which the tax will be withheld
and remitted to the City in accordance with Section
181.06, the taxpayer need not file a declaration.
   (b)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each
year during the life of this chapter, or within 105 days of the date the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year or period differing from
the calendar year shall file a declaration within 105 days after the start of
each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by, or
obtainable from, the Director of Finance, provided, however, credit shall be
taken for the City tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In
accordance with the provisions of Section
181.15 hereof, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another income taxing authority not federal.
      (2)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment thereof, may
be increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (d)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax and
at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the
sixth, ninth and twelfth months after the beginning of the taxable year.
Provided however, that in case an amended declaration has been filed, the
unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
   (e)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be
paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
181.05. (Ord. 80-212. Passed 3-26-80.)

then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City of
Youngstown each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City of Youngstown
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the City of Youngstown, a taxpayer has paid tax
to other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
of Youngstown for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

domiciled in the City of Youngstown for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(l)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the City
of Youngstown for all or part of the taxable year.
      (2)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled

         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the City
of Youngstown. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one

      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F) (2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Youngstown during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Youngstown to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or

compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
183.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
of Youngstown to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(l) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City of Youngstown, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax

with respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an
alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
183.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
183.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(l)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

Youngstown from a stock of goods located within the City of Youngstown.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City of Youngstown

sales within the City of Youngstown and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the City of
Youngstown to purchasers outside the City of Youngstown, provided that the

which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Youngstown.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City of Youngstown's tax only
if the property generating the net profit is located in the City of Youngstown
or if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the

lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City of Youngstown shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the City of Youngstown. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
City of Youngstown's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F) (1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,

business in the City of Youngstown shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of
Youngstown. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
183.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate of 2.75%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall

the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax

deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or

behalf of the City of Youngstown in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Youngstown in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (B)(l)(a) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(l)(a) of this section of taxes required to

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of Youngstown. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agents, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City of Youngstown as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this Ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City of Youngstown income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Ordinance or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City of Youngstown the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Youngstown income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City of Youngstown until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City of Youngstown during the preceding calendar year;

calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was

calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting

      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Youngstown income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and
remitted for the purposes of this section.

another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)( a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described

wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Youngstown exceeds the 20-day threshold, the

qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Youngstown.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City of Youngstown and the

income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Youngstown 's income
tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the

tax return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before
the date the City of Youngstown income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator

payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except

circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B) (1)(a) of Section
183.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City of Youngstown by an employer, the agent

income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Youngstown ,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Youngstown or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the

Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the City of Youngstown
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Youngstown;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of

included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Youngstown income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
183.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"

more members of such an affiliated group.

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.21.
   
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
183.18(A)(4).
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Youngstown, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Youngstown as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Youngstown is subject to recovery by the
City of Youngstown. If the City of Youngstown's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the City of Youngstown shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the City of Youngstown claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City of Youngstown's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Youngstown's tax rate. However, if the City of Youngstown's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Youngstown, along with
any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City of Youngstown changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the City of Youngstown. The amended return shall be filed
on a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
183.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)    (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Youngstown. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
183.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Youngstown 's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the City of Youngstown return
showing income subject to the City of Youngstown income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional the City of Youngstown income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (l)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(l)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
183.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
183.09.
   (D)   (l)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Youngstown does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final dete1mination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
183.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
183.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City of Youngstown income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (l)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Youngstown
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(l)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)( a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (l)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the City of
Youngstown official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C) (1) (b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City of Youngstown that arises pursuant to the City of Youngstown's
income tax imposed in accordance with this Ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this Ordinance prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (l)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City of
Youngstown as authorized by this Ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
Ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City of Youngstown from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-379. Passed 11-18-15.)
   183.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City of Youngstown ordinance
or state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City of Youngstown or the Tax
Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or

period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City of Youngstown or for the withholding of

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Ordinance
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
183.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
183.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
183.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
183.99 for a violation of Section
183.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

attributable to such premises, and such taxes shall be a lien on such premises.
   (I)   When an exemption from the payment of the arena admission tax is
granted by the Director of Finance for a given organization in accordance with
the provisions of Section
185.03, such exemption shall be considered as the equivalent of the license
herein provided for.
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)
   185.06  REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   (a)   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following
the close of each prior month, or at the close of any longer reporting period
which may be established by the Director of Finance, make a return to the
Director of Finance, on forms obtainable from him, of the total admissions
charged and received and the amount of tax collected for the same. Claims for
exemption from the tax shall be filed with the report. At the time the return
is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Director of Finance. The Director of Finance may establish shorter reporting
periods for any operator if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection
of the tax, and he may require further information in the return if such
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. All taxes collected by
operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the City until payment thereof is made to the Director of Finance. All returns
and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated as confidential by the
Director of Finance, and shall not be released by him except on order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States,
the State of Ohio, the County of Mahoning, or the City for official use only.
The nonavailability or failure to obtain forms shall not relieve an operator
from timely paying such tax.
 
   (b)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report, or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing
of any false or fraudulent return, report, or statement.
   (c)    If any operator required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on two consecutive months within a twelve month period, to file such
returns when due or to pay the tax
thereon, or if any operator authorized by the Director of Finance to file
returns at less frequent intervals fails, on two or more occasions within a
twenty-four month period, to file such returns when due or to pay the tax due
thereon, the Director of Finance may require such operator to furnish security
in an amount equal to the average tax liability of the operator for a period of
one year, as determined by the Director of Finance from a review of returns or
other information pertaining to such operator, which amount shall in no event
be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Such security may be in the form of
an advance tax payment to be applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns
or a corporate surety bond, satisfactory to the Director of Finance,
conditioned on payment of the tax due with the returns from the operator. Such
security must be filed within ten days following the operator's receipt of the
notice from the Director of Finance of its requirements. A corporate surety
bond filed under this section shall be returned to the operator if, for a
period of twelve consecutive months following the date the bond was filed, the
operator has filed all returns and remitted payment therewith within the time
prescribed in this chapter.
   (d)    If any operator required to file returns and to remit tax due to the
City under the provisions of this chapter fails for any reason to make such
filing or payment, any of its members, officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)
   185.07  PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance within thirty days following the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal to ten percent
(10%) of the amount of the tax and previous penalty, in addition to the tax and
the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the total tax and the penalties for each previous thirty day
period shall be added for each successive 30-day period that the account
remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Director of Finance determines that the nonpayment of
any remittance due under this ordinance is a result of fraud, a penalty equal
to twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) above.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who
fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate
of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax,

delinquent until paid.

under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section

   (a)   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the arena admission
tax or to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and
remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the
Director of Finance shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain
facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as
the Director of Finance shall procure such facts and information as he is able
to obtain on which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter
payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same or to
make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess
against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this
chapter. In case such determination is made, the Director of Finance shall give
a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so
assessed at his last known address. Such operator may, within ten days after
the serving or mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the
Director of Finance for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the
operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax,
interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Director of Finance shall
become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable.
   (b)   If the operator makes an application to the Director of Finance for a
hearing on the assessment within the time and in the manner provided in Section
185.08(a), the Director of Finance shall give not less than five days written
notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time
and place fixed in such notice why the assessment of arena admission tax,
interest, and penalties should not be sustained. At such hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why such assessment of tax, interest, and
penalties should not be sustained. After such hearing, the Director of Finance
shall determine the proper tax, interest and penalty to be remitted, and shall
thereafter give written notice to the operator in the manner prescribed herein
of the determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalty. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable within thirty days after the
Director of Finance issues such written determination of the amount of tax,
interest and penalty payable by the operator, unless an appeal is taken as
provided in Section
185.09. Subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Board of
Review, the Director of Finance shall have the power to compromise any
assessment of interest and penalties.
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)
   185.09 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of Finance rendered
after a hearing held in accordance with Section
185.08 with respect to the amount of arena admission tax, interest and
penalties, if any, owed by the operator may appeal such decision to the Board
of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Board of Review within thirty
days of the serving or mailing of such decision of the Director of Finance. The
Board of Review shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and shall
give notice in writing to such operator at his last known resident address. The
findings of the Board of Review shall be final and conclusive, and shall be
served on the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of
hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable on
service of the notice.
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)

payment to the City of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve
such records or receipts, issuance of complimentary tickets, and otherwise,
together with the ticket stubs and other pertinent documents in such form as
the Director of Finance may require. If the operator furnishes admissions not
subject to the tax, the operator's records shall show the nature of the
transaction.
   (b)   All such records and other documents shall be open during business
hours to the inspection of the Director of Finance and shall be preserved for a
period of four years, unless the Director of Finance consents in writing to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer.
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)
   185.11 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded, provided a claim
in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds on
which the claim is founded, is filed with the Director of Finance within three
years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the
Director of Finance. The Director of Finance may determine the amount of any
such erroneous or overpayment.
   (b)   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto, and such refund exceeds one dollar ($1.00).
(Ord. 07-161. Passed 6-20-07.)
   185.12 TAXES MADE A LIEN.
   (a)   The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be a lien on all of the
property of any operator required to collect and pay or to pay the same. If an
operator shall sell its business or shall quit business, such operator shall be
required to make out the return provided for under this chapter within thirty
days after the date of sale of such business or retirement there from, and the
operator's successor in business shall be required to withhold a sufficient
amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of such taxes so collected and
unpaid, together with interest, if any, until such time as the former owner
shall produce a receipt from the Director of Finance showing that the taxes
have been paid or a certificate that no taxes are due.
   (b)   If the purchaser of a business shall fail to withhold purchase money
as above provided, and the taxes so collected shall be due and unpaid after the
thirty day period allowed, he shall be liable for the payment of the taxes
collected and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former
owner, together with interest and penalty, as provided by this chapter.
   (c)   The lien for unpaid taxes herein imposed shall not become effective
until such time as the Director of Finance shall certify to the County Auditor
of Mahoning County the amount of taxes delinquent, and such certification is
placed on record by the County Recorder in a book maintained for that purpose.

invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses or sections or other parts of this chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section

   (g)   Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor on a first offense; on a second offense within one year after the
first offense, the person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on
each subsequent offense within one year after the first offense, the person is

system. The selection of locations where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this section shall be made on the basis of sound professional
traffic engineering and law enforcement judgments, as approved by the Chief of
Police.
   (c)   The Chief of Police or designee is empowered to issue notices of
liability for persons who commit violations at such locations, to present
violations to a court with jurisdiction over the matter for the purposes of
determining contested issues, including liability, and to promulgate any rules
and regulations deemed to be necessary to carry out the provisions and
enforcement of this chapter.
(Ord. 22-426. Passed 11-15-22.)
 
   307.03 NOTICE OF LIABILITY.
   (a)   Prior to the activation of a photo traffic enforcement system at a
location, the Chief of Police or designee shall erect a sign in a conspicuous
location that provides notice that a photo traffic enforcement system is being
used to monitor traffic, as required by Ohio R.C. 4511.094.
 
   (b)   For thirty (30) days after the activation of a photo red light or
speed traffic enforcement system at a location, no notices of liability will be
issued based upon the images produced by the system. Warnings may be issued
during this thirty (30) day period.
 
   (c)   A police officer, or other special officer as defined in Section
49 of the Charter of the City of Youngstown, shall examine the image recorded
by the photo traffic enforcement system to determine whether a violation as
defined in Section
307.01(e) of this chapter has occurred. If the image recorded by the photo
traffic enforcement system shows a violation, contains a date and time of the
violation, and shows the vehicle's license plate number as well as the state in
which the license was issued, the officer may use any lawful means to identify
the vehicle's owner.
 
   (d)   It shall be prima-facie evidence that the person registered as the
owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles or with any other
State vehicle registration office, or as defined in Section
307.01(d), was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation as defined in
Section
307.01(e) of this chapter.
 
   (e)    Within thirty (30) days of the violation and upon identification of
the registered owner of the vehicle, the Chief of Police or designee may issue
a notice of violation and notice of liability, charging the owner with a
violation. The notice of violation and notice of liability shall be sent by
first-class U.S. mail and must state the date on which the notice of liability
was issued, the date, time and location of the violation, the time in which an
answer must be made by the vehicle owner, and the manner in which the notice of
liability may be appealed. In addition, a copy of the image(s) that served as a
basis for the violation must accompany the notice of liability. In the event
the issuing agent subsequently receives a USPS return of the originally issued
notice marked as "undeliverable," within thirty (30) days of receipt, the
issuing agent may re-issue the notice of violation and notice of liability to
the registered owner. Other than the modification of the date on which the
notice of liability was re-issued, the re-issued notice of liability shall
conform in all other respects to the requirement of this section.
   (f)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering or limiting
the liability of the owner or operator of a motor vehicle for any violation of
the Ohio Revised Code or City of Youngstown Traffic Code set forth in these
Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those traffic laws, or
the ability of a police officer to enforce those traffic laws against any
offender observed by the officer violating any of those traffic laws. Nothing
in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a
vehicle for any violation as defined in Section
 307.01(e) of this chapter.
(Ord. 22-426. Passed 11-15-22.)
   307.04 REGISTERED OWNER ACTION AFTER ISSUANCE OF A TICKET.
   (a)   A person or entity who receives a ticket for a civil violation sent in
compliance with Section
307.03 shall elect to do one of the following:
      (1)    In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby admitting liability and waiving the opportunity to contest the
violation; or
      (2)    Within thirty (30) days after mailing of the ticket, provide the
municipal court with jurisdiction over the civil action with either of the
following affidavits:
         A.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
         B.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at the
time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to the
motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or control
of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant permission
to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the
license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation and therefore
were not under the control or possession of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a report about the
stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the appropriate law
enforcement agency prior to the violation.
   (b)   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation if,
within thirty days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (A)(2)(a) or (b) of this
Section to the court with jurisdiction and the following conditions are met:
      (1)    If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (A)(2)(a) of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or by failing to
request a court hearing within thirty days or is determined liable in a court
hearing;
      (2)    If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (A)(2)(b) of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division;
definitively that substantiates an actual theft;
      (3)    If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the court with jurisdiction of the name
and address of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the time of the
traffic law violation. The court shall approve the form of the notice. A motor
vehicle leasing dealer or motor vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket
for an alleged traffic law violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring
device is not liable for a ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the
care, custody, or control of a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged
violation. The dealer shall not pay such a ticket and subsequently attempt to
collect a fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a
ticket made on behalf of the lessee or renter.
      (4)    If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the court with jurisdiction an affidavit in a form established by
the court, sworn to or affirmed by an agent of the corporate entity, that
provides the name and address of the employee who was operating the motor
vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and who is the designated party.
      (5)    Contest the ticket by filing a written request for a court hearing
to review the ticket in a form approved by the Court.
         A.   The person or entity shall file the written request not later
than thirty (30) days after receipt of the ticket;
         B.   Upon timely filing, the Court shall schedule a hearing date and
notify the parties of the date, time, and place of the hearing; Notice of
hearing shall be provided in accordance with local court rules;
         C.   The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with local
court rules.
         D.   The filing of a written request for hearing under this division
does not stay enforcement and collection of the judgment or default judgment
from which the request for hearing is taken,
         E.   The court shall charge the applicable court costs and fees for
such a civil action to the party that does not prevail in the action and as
otherwise provided for in O.R.C. 4511.099(A) and 4511.099(B).
   (c)   The failure to request a hearing within this time period constitutes a
waiver of the right to contest the violation and ticket, and is deemed to
constitute an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest
the violation.
   (d)   A court with jurisdiction that receives an affidavit, described in
division (A)(2)(a) or (A)(2)(b) of this section or a notification under
division (B) of this section, from a registered owner may proceed to notify the
local authority to send a ticket that conforms with division (B) of section
4511.097 of the Revised Code to the designated party. The local authority, or
its agent, shall send the ticket to the designated party by first-class U.S.
mail not later than twenty-one days after receipt of the notification. (Ord.
22-426. Passed 11-15-22; Ord. 23-364. Passed 9-20-23.)
   307.05 CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Unless the operator of a vehicle personally receives a traffic
citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, a civil penalty
shall be imposed for a violation of this Chapter as follows:
        (1)    From six (6) to fourteen (14) miles per hour over the speed
limit: one hundred dollars ($100.00);
      (2)    From fifteen (15) to twenty (20) miles per hour over the speed
limit: one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00);
      (3)    In excess of twenty (20) miles per hour over the speed limit: one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00);
       
   (b)   A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section
shall not be considered a traffic offense or a moving violation for the purpose
of assessing points under Ohio R.C. 4507.021 and shall not be reported to the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles of any state.
 
   (c)   Upon receipt of a notice of liability pursuant to the method described
in Section
 307.03, the vehicle owner shall have thirty (30) days to pay the civil penalty
without additional monetary civil penalty.
 
   (d)   If the vehicle owner does not respond to the notice of liability
within this period, the following action shall be taken by the Chief of Police,
or designee:
            (1)    A notice of default judgment shall be sent by first-class
U.S. mail to the recipient of the notice of liability indicating that payment
is due within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of default judgment.
            (2)    The notice of default judgment shall contain the following
information:
         A.   An identification of the violation with which the person was
charged and the time and date of the violation, which identification may be a
copy of the notice of liability charging the violation that was served upon the
person;
         B.   An identification of the amount of the administrative fine, late
fees and costs arising out of the violation that is due;
         C.   A warning that the person must answer the notice of liability
within thirty (30) days or a default civil judgment in the amount of the fine,
penalties and costs due may be entered against the person;
         D.   A description of the allowable answers that may be made and
notification that the person will be afforded a hearing before the court if the
vehicle owner denies in his answer that he committed the violation;
         E.   An identification of the manners in which and the entity to which
an answer may be made;
         F.   A warning that if the person fails to appear at a requested
hearing, a default civil judgment in the amount of the fine, penalties and
costs due may be entered against the person.
     
   (e)   If a person who is issued a notice of default judgment fails to timely
answer, the failure to answer shall be considered an admission that the person
committed the violation and a default judgment, in the amount of the fine,
civil penalties and costs due may be entered against the person. Failure to
timely answer the notice of liability identified in the notice of default
judgment within thirty (30) days shall result in the imposition of an
additional late civil penalty fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). Failure to pay
the civil penalty and the twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee within 60 days
from the date of mailing of the notice of liability will result in the
imposition of an additional twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee, bringing the
default fee to forty dollars ($40.00). Failure to pay the civil penalty and the
forty dollar ($40.00) default fee within 90 days of mailing of the notice of
liability will result in an additional twenty dollar ($20.00) default fee,
bringing the default fee to the total amount of sixty dollars ($60.00), and the
unpaid civil penalty and default fee shall be forwarded for collection.
 
   (f)   A person who receives a notice of default judgment pursuant to this
section may answer the charged violation that is identified in the notice of
default judgment in any manner provided in this section as an answer to
violation charged in a notice of liability. An answer under this section shall
be made within thirty (30) days after the date on which the notice of default
judgment was mailed in accordance with the methods provided in this section,
except that if the answer consists solely of payment of the civil penalty
arising out of the notice of liability any civil penalty arising out of failing
to timely answer shall also be imposed.
 
   (g)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under this section
of this chapter fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit
evidence, the Court shall, upon a determination from any testimony or exhibits
presented at the hearing that the City demonstrated by a preponderance of the
evidence that the person committed the violation, enter a default judgment
against the person and require the person to pay the appropriate fine and any
additional penalties, fees and costs. A default judgment entered under this
division shall be entered in the court's record and filed with the Clerk of
Court for the court in which the default judgment was entered.
   (h)   The court may vacate a default judgment entered under this section if
all of the following apply:
      (1)   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the court within one (1) year of the date of entry of the default
judgment; and
      (2)    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the violation out of
which the judgment arose; and
      (3)    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's failure
to attend the hearing or answer the notice of default judgment.
   (i)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this section shall be made to the Youngstown Municipal Clerk of
Court or its designee within ten (10) days of the date of entry. The Clerk of
Court or its designee shall create and maintain a record of all money paid in
satisfaction of a judgment or default judgment. If payment is not made within
this time period, the judgment or default judgment shall be filed with the
Clerk of the Youngstown Municipal Court and when so filed, shall have the same
force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered in that court.
   (j)   All fee money collected for payment of fines, judgment, or default
judgment in accordance with this Chapter shall be forwarded to the City of
Youngstown Finance Department and a fund shall be created and monies shall be
allocated from said fund in compliance with any applicable statutory or
legislative regulations, including any and all exceptions and/or exemptions
categorized within said regulations.
   (k)   In the event a fine or penalty is assessed pursuant to any provision
of this Code, a default in the payment of a fine, penalty or any installment of
a fine or penalty may be collected by any means authorized for the collection
of monetary judgments. The City Law Director, or designee, may retain attorneys
and private collection agents for the purpose of collecting any default in
payment of any fine or penalty imposed by the Code, or any installment of a
fine or penalty. The City or its designee shall add a thirty-five percent (35%)
cost of collections to any outstanding balance that requires the City to retain
the services of a collection agency. This thirty-five percent (35%) cost
includes any default in a fine, penalty or any installment of a fine or penalty
that was previously referred to an attorney or private agency and the payment
of which remains outstanding.

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

   313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting
different colored lights, or colored lighted arrows, successively one at a time
or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used except
for special pedestrian signals carrying words or symbols. The lights shall
indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and to pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits
either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully
within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is
exhibited.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in
combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only
to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is
permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic
shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent
crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal
is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked
crosswalk.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow
signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or
that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular
traffic shall not enter the intersection.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal,
unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section
313.05, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the
roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal alone shall stop at a
clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection, or if none, then before entering the
intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown
except as provided in subsections (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a right turn as provided in
subsection (c)(5) hereof, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal may
cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn after stopping as
required by subsection (c)(1) hereof. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the
right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   Unless a sign is in place prohibiting a left turn as provided in
subsection (c)(5) hereof, vehicular traffic facing a steady red signal on a
one-way street that intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to
the left may cautiously enter the intersection to make a left turn into the
one-way street after stopping as required by subsection (c)(1) hereof, and
yielding the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (4)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as
provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the
roadway.
      (5)   Council may by ordinance, or the authorized local authority may by
rule, prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red signal at any
intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice thereof are
posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Signals; Locations Other Than Intersections: In the event an official
traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to
those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop
required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where
the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop
shall be made at the signal. (ORC 4511.13)
   313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNALS OVER INDIVIDUAL LANES.
   (a)   When lane-use control signals are placed over individual lanes of a
street or highway, such signals shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
as follows:
      (1)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow: Vehicular traffic may travel in any
lane over which a green arrow signal is shown.
      (2)   A Steady Yellow "X":  Vehicular traffic is warned to vacate in a
safe manner any lane over which such signal is shown to avoid occupying that
lane when a steady red "X" signal is shown.
      (3)   A Flashing Yellow "X": Vehicular traffic may use with proper
caution any lane over which such signal is shown for only the purpose of making
a left turn.
      (4)   A Steady Red "X": Vehicular traffic shall not enter or travel in
any lane over which such signal is shown. (ORC 4511.131)

"don't walk," or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   "Walk" or the symbol of a walking person: Pedestrians facing such
signal may proceed across the roadway in the direction of the signal and shall
be given the right of way by the operators of all vehicles.
      (2)   "Don't walk" or the symbol of an upraised palm:  No pedestrian
shall start to cross the roadway in the direction of the signal.

or wanton disregard of the safety of persons or property. (ORC 4511.20)
   (b)   No person shall operate a vehicle on any public or private property
other than streets or highways, in willful or wanton disregard of the safety of

such operation thereon.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

   333.03 MAXIMUM SPEED LIMITS; ASSURED CLEAR DISTANCE AHEAD.
   (a)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle at a speed greater or less
than is reasonable or proper, having due regard to the traffic, surface and
width of the street or highway and any other conditions, and no person shall
drive any motor vehicle in and upon any street or highway at a greater speed
than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of
Transportation or Council, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the
same at a speed not exceeding the following:
      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof. The end of every school zone may be marked by a
sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section or in the manual
and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, "school" means any school chartered
under Ohio R.C. 3301.16 and any nonchartered school that during the preceding
year filed with the Department of Education in compliance with rule 3301-35-08
of the Ohio Administrative Code, a copy of the school's report for the parents
of the school's pupils certifying that the school meets Ohio minimum standards
for nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing
to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway. Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries. The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial
action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional
school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.
         D.   As used in this subsection, "crosswalk" has the meaning given
that term in Section
301.09. The Director may, upon request by resolution of Council, and upon
submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;
      (2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the
Municipality, except on State routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts and alleys;
      (3)   Thirty-five miles per hour on all State routes or through highways
within the Municipality outside business districts, except as provided in
subsections (b)(4) and (5) hereof;
      (4)   Fifty miles per hour on controlled-access highways and expressways
within the Municipality;
      (5)   Fifty miles per hour on State routes within the Municipality
outside urban districts unless a lower prima-facie speed is established as

      (8)   Fifty-five miles per hour at all times on portions of freeways that
are part of the interstate system and on all portions of freeways that are not
part of the interstate system, but are built to the standards and
specifications that are applicable to freeways that are part of the interstate
system for operators of any motor vehicle weighing in excess of eight thousand
pounds empty weight and any noncommercial bus except as provided in subsection
(b)(11) hereof;
      (9)   Fifty-five miles per hour for operators of any motor vehicle
weighing eight thousand pounds or less empty weight and any commercial bus at
all times on all portions of freeways that are part of the interstate system
and that had such a speed limit established prior to October 1, 1995, and
freeways that are not part of the interstate system, but are built to the
standards and specifications that are applicable to freeways that are part of
the interstate system and that had such a speed limit established prior to
October 1, 1995, unless a higher speed limit is established under Ohio R.C.
4511.21(L);
      (10)   Sixty-five miles per hour for operators of any motor vehicle
weighing eight thousand pounds or less empty weight and any commercial bus at
all times on all portions of the following:
         A.   Freeways that are part of the interstate system and that had such
a speed limit established prior to October 1, 1995, and freeways that are not
part of the interstate system, but are built to the standards and
specifications that are applicable to freeways that are part of the interstate
system and that had such a speed limit established prior to October 1, 1995;
         B.   Freeways that are part of the interstate system and freeways that
are not part of the interstate system but are built to the standards and
specifications that are applicable to freeways that are part of the interstate
system, and that had such a speed limit established under Ohio R.C. 4511.21(L);
         C.   Rural, divided, multi-lane highways that are designated as part
of the national highway system under the “National Highway System Designation
Act of 1995", 109 Stat. 568, 23 U.S.C.A. 103, and that had such a speed limit
established under Ohio R.C. 4511.21(M).
      (11)   Sixty-five miles per hour at all times on all portions of freeways
that are part of the interstate system and that had such a speed limit on the
effective date of this amendment for operators of any motor vehicle weighing in
excess of eight thousand pounds empty weight and any noncommercial bus.
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or any declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and
it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed limitations in
subsection (d) hereof. No person shall be convicted of more than one violation
of this section for the same conduct, although violations of more than one
provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a single
affidavit.

freeway as provided in subsection (b)(10) and (b)(11) hereof;
      (2)   At a speed exceeding sixty-five miles per hour upon a freeway as
provided in subsection (b)(10) and (b)(11) hereof;
      (3)   If a motor vehicle weighing in excess of 8,000 pounds empty weight
or a noncommercial bus as prescribed in subsection (b)(8) hereof, at a speed
exceeding fifty-five miles per hour upon a freeway as provided in that
subsection.
      (4)   At a speed exceeding the posted speed limit upon a freeway for
which the Director has determined and declared a speed limit of not more than
sixty- five miles per hour pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21(L)(2) or (M);

which such a speed limit has been established through the operation of Ohio
R.C. 4511.21(L)(3);
      (6)   At a speed exceeding the posted speed limit upon a freeway for
which the Director has determined and declared a speed limit pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 4511.21(I)(2).
   (e)   In every charge of violation of this section the affidavit and warrant
shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) hereof is alleged,
the defendant shall be charged in a single affidavit, alleging a single act,
with a violation indicated of both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of
a limit declared or established pursuant to this section by the Director or
local authorities, and of the limitation in subsection (d)(1), (2), (3), (4),
(5), or (6) hereof. If the court finds a violation of subsection (b)(1)A. to
(b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established pursuant to this section has
occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction under such subsection and
dismiss the charge under subsection (d)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6) hereof.
If it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d)(1), (2), (3),
(4), (5), or (6) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs. It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the

indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed pursuant to this subsection,
provided the court determines the offender is an indigent person and is unable
to pay the fine. (Ord. 99-31. Passed 2-17-99.)

   The registrar of motor vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to

of time specified in that subsection. The court may grant the person such
driving privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the
restrictions established in subsection (c)(1) will seriously affect the
person’s ability to continue in employment or educational training or will
cause undue hardship on the license holder or a family member of the license
holder. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall specify the
purposes, times, and places of the privileges and shall issue the person
appropriate forms setting forth the privileges granted. Occupational or

installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

prosecution of a person for such violation.

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (c)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (d)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a
certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against
conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that
nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware
that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a
certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that
such circumstances probably exist.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely
to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is
reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a
certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent with
respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he
fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
         (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer,
agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope
of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
         (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in
the section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope
of his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
         (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
         (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for
the commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested,
commanded, tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners
or by a high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution. Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount
of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes restitution,
the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended
by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
         All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
         The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of

organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

   509.075 NEGLIGENT FALSE ALARMS.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to reduce the number of false police
and fire alarms in the City in an effort to protect the public safety by
minimizing unnecessary use of emergency services resources.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   Chargeable false alarm. A chargeable false alarm is defined, for
the purpose of this section, as any alarm system activation that causes a
response from the Youngstown Police and/or Fire Department that is determined
by the responding department as false and probable cause exists demonstrating
that the false alarm was caused by the negligence of the person or persons
responsible for the operation of said alarm.
      (2)   Alarm system. Any system installed permanently or temporarily,
monitoring a place of business, residence, or other private property, designed
to signal directly or indirectly a response from the Police/Fire Departments
alerting the presence of fire, smoke, carbon dioxide or monoxide, robbery,
burglary, vandalism, or unauthorized intrusion.
      (3)   Not respond list. Following five chargeable false alarms within a
twelve- month period, an alarm location may be placed on a list, with the Chief
of Police/Fire’s approval, instructing the Police Department not to respond to
said alarm only. The Fire Department may respond with only one truck in this
situation. Alarm response can be restored following payment of all outstanding
citations, an approval of the beat officer or his supervisor.
   (c)   Violations/Penalty.
      (1)   No person shall negligently allow more than one chargeable false
alarm within a thirty-day period. A written warning shall be left with a
responsible party, or at the alarm location, for the first chargeable false
alarm. The second chargeable false alarm within a thirty-day period is a minor
misdemeanor. The third, and any additional chargeable false alarms, within a
thirty-day period shall be a third degree misdemeanor.
      (2)   After five chargeable false alarms for the same alarm system
location within a twelve-month period, the beat officer or Fire Inspector, with
approval of his/her supervisor, may submit to the Chief of Police/Fire a
request to place the above location on a “not respond list” if the Police/Fire
Chief determines that the alarm location is a recurring problem, to wit: public
nuisance, the alarm location will be placed on the “not respond list” whereupon
police units will not respond to an alarm only, at that location and Fire
Department with only one truck.
      (3)   A location that is listed on the “not respond list” can resume
normal response following an effort to correct problems with the alarm and an
inspection by the beat officer with his recommendation to the Fire/Police
Chief. Following all outstanding fines being paid, the Fire/Police Chief may
then delete the alarm location from said “not respond list”.
      (4)   Exemptions: All City, County, state, federal and Board of Education
properties are exempt from this section.

   541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

building or other building or structure that is owned or controlled by the
State, any political subdivision, or any department, agency or instrumentality
of the State or a political subdivision, and that is used for public purposes.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

involved is five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section

a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value is the aggregate
value of all property and services involved in all of the offenses in the
course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.

property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest

   (b)   This section shall not apply to the property owner as set forth in the
records of the Mahoning County Auditor’s Office or any non-owner with the
written authority of the registered owner. If the structure is or appears to be
abandoned or vacant, the trier of fact may presume that the defendant did not
have consent or permission to remove the items. This permissive presumption
does not relieve the prosecution of the burden to produce evidence that the
structure is or appears to be abandoned or vacant.
   (c)   Disposition of Evidence or Property Seized in Conjunction with this
Offense: Upon a date not less than thirty (30) days following the “final
disposition of any prosecution” under this section, the Youngstown Police

and intended to be used as evidence in the prosecution or any property that was
seized in conjunction with the commission of an offense under this section by
delivering it to a scrap metal processing facility or any other duly-licensed
and lawful business that accepts such material for scrap value. Any personal
property, tools or motor vehicles that are suitable for use by the Youngstown
Police Department may be forfeited and assigned to them for official agency
use.
   Prior to delivering such material to a scrap metal processing facility or
any other duly- licensed and lawful business that accepts such material for
scrap value, the Youngstown Police Department shall photograph the material and
shall retain the photograph as part of the criminal case file. The Youngstown
Police Department shall retain the receipt for the transaction and any proceeds
derived from the sale or disposition of the material shall be deposited into
the Youngstown Police Department’s Law Enforcement Trust Fund or other account
maintained for the benefit of the Youngstown Police Department and the proceeds
shall be used for law enforcement purposes.
      (1)   “Final disposition of any prosecution” means that the defendant has
been sentenced upon conviction or plea for a violation of this section or any
amended offense stemming from a violation of this section, the time to perfect
an appeal has passed and no appeal has been filed, and no valid claim has been
filed for the recovery of the material.
   (d)   Forfeiture of property is specifically authorized herein pursuant to
Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2981 et seq. or pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
of the City of Youngstown.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of unauthorized removal and
the penalty shall be determined as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided, unauthorized removal is a misdemeanor
of the first degree. The court shall impose a mandatory fine of two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
      (2)   If the offender has previously been convicted of unauthorized
removal or any theft or theft-related offense, unauthorized removal is an
unspecified misdemeanor. The court may impose a term of incarceration of up to
one year and may impose a fine of up to two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500). The court shall impose a mandatory minimum fee of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and shall impose a mandatory minimum term of incarceration of
ten consecutive days.

Floor, 26 S. Phelps Street, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, a written request for
appeal setting forth the address of the property which was the subject of the
notice or order, the name, address, and telephone number of the Appellant, and
a brief statement of the grounds for the appeal. Requests shall be filed within
fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice, and shall be accompanied by a
deposit of $15.00 which shall be nonrefundable, or an affidavit of indigency.
Upon receipt of the request, the Property Maintenance Appeals Board will set a
hearing within 60 days. Upon setting the hearing, the Appeals Board shall
notify the appellant of the date, time and place. Written notice of the hearing
shall be sent by ordinary U.S. Mail at least seven (7) days prior to the
hearing. At the hearing, the Appellant shall be given an opportunity to be
heard and to show cause why the notice or order should be modified or
dismissed, or why a variance should be granted. The failure of the Appellant or
his/her representative to appear and present his/her position at the hearing
shall be grounds for dismissal of the appeal.
   (b)   Variances. The Property Maintenance Appeals Board shall interpret the
intent of this code in specific cases where, on appeal, it clearly appears
that, by reason of special conditions, undue hardship would result from a
literal application of any section of this code. Where undue hardship is
clearly demonstrated, the Board may permit a variance from the applicable
section if the dwelling will vary only slightly from the literal provisions of
this code, but will comply with the spirit and intent of this code.
   (c)   Decisions.  After a hearing on the request, the Property Maintenance
Appeals Board may affirm, disaffirm, modify or dismiss the notice or order, or
grant a variance from the notice or order, by a majority vote of the Board
members who are present. The Appellant shall be notified within 15 days of the
hearing, in writing, of the findings. Decisions shall be sent by regular U.S.
mail to the Appellant's address as provided on the appeal form.
   (d)   Records. The proceedings before the Property Maintenance Appeals Board
shall be recorded and its decisions shall be set forth in writing. The
recordings and written decisions shall be entered as a matter of public record
in the Code Enforcement Department. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
Property Maintenance Appeals Board may seek relief therefrom in any court of
competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws of the State of Ohio.
((Ord. 16-119. Passed 4-6-16.)
   546.10 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE APPEALS BOARD.
   (a)   The Appeals Board shall consist of a minimum of three members who are
qualified by experience and training to pass on matters pertaining to property
maintenance and who are not employees of the City of Youngstown. The Board
shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Youngstown.
   (b)   The Mayor shall also appoint two or more alternative members who shall
sit on the Board to hear appeals when needed due to the absence or
disqualification of other Board members. Alternate members shall possess the
qualifications required for Board membership.

authority to do either of the following:
      (1)   The Board shall have the authority to grant extension(s) of time
for compliance with notices and orders issued by the Code Official or his or
her designee. Application for extensions of time for compliance shall be
considered on the basis of public interest and welfare in addition to any
possible economic benefit or hardship to applicant, and shall be granted only
when it is established that such request will not be detrimental to the
occupants or to public health, safety or welfare.
      (2)   The Board shall have the authority to grant appeals and/or waive
any provisions of this code in specific cases where it clearly appears that by
reason of special conditions, undue hardship would result from a literal
translation or application of any section of this code. Applications for
variances and waivers shall be granted only where the deviations are minor in
character, and where it appears that substantial compliance with the minimum
housing standards and the spirit and intent of this code have been met by the
applicant and that granting of the variance or waiver would not be detrimental
to the occupants or to the public health, safety or welfare.
         (Ord. 16-119. Passed 4-6-16.)
   546.11 RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF RENTAL UNITS.

property areas and exterior structure in good repair, (3) keep all common areas
in a clean and sanitary condition, (4) provide all utilities, facilities,
equipment and services required by this code, (5) provide for the extermination
of insects in an acceptable means not injurious to human health, (6) provide
solid waste disposal facilities or containers for all dwelling units, and (7)
comply with all regulations and rules designated by the Code Official or his or
her designee to enforce and interpret this section.
   (b)   Code Official. The Code Official or his or her designee is charged
with the enforcement of this section including but not limited to, conducting
inspections and issuing notices, orders and penalties.
   (c)   Rental License Requirement. Any person, corporation, business entity
or owner of property seeking to rent or let a rental unit shall first obtain a
valid rental license for said unit.
Exception: Owners or operators of public housing or rental units subject to
annual inspections pursuant to federal regulations are not required to obtain a
rental license.
   (d)    Applying for a Rental License. To apply for a rental license, the
owner of the property must:
      (1)   Complete a Rental License Application Form, and
      (2)    Pay a nonrefundable fee of $40.00 for a single rental unit, or
$40.00 for the first rental unit and $25.00 for each additional rental unit for
properties containing multiple units.
   (e)   Provisional Rental License. Upon applying for a rental license, the
Code Official or his or her designee shall issue a provision rental license.
The provision license will remain valid for a period of up to one year, unless
earlier revoked as provided for herein, or replaced by a rental license. A
provisional license will allow for occupancy until the property is inspected by
the Code Official or his or her designee.
   (f)    Inspection. Within 30 days of the receipt of a rental application and
required fee, the Code Official or his or her designee will attempt to schedule
an inspection of the rental unit. If the owner and occupant, if applicable,
consent to the inspection, the owner shall make the property available for
inspection at a time agreeable to the owner and Code Official. If the owner
and/or occupant, if applicable, refuse to allow an inspection of the property,
the Code Official or his or her designee shall seek to secure an administrative
warrant.
   If after inspection, the Code Official or his or her designee determines
that the rental unit is in compliance with this code, the Code Official shall
issue an authorized rental license for the rental unit. Such license shall be
valid for one year from the date of issuance unless a change or alteration of
the premises shall alter the authorized occupancy.
   If after inspection, the Code Official or his or her designee determines
that the rental unit is not in compliance with this code, the Code Official
shall notify the titled owner that the rental unit does not comply with the
requirements of this section, set forth the violations, and order that the
violations be corrected within thirty (30) days. This notice shall be sent via
regular U.S. mail to the address the owner provided on his or her application.
Upon the expiration of the thirty (30) days, the Code Official or his or her
designee shall schedule a re-inspection of the rental unit. A fee of $40.00
shall be imposed for this re-inspection.
   Should an owner schedule an appointment with the Code Official or his or her
designee and seek to cancel said appointment, but fail to do so by 8:00 a.m.
the day of the inspection, the Code Official shall impose a penalty of $25.00
against the owner. If this occurs a second time, the Code Official shall impose
a fine of $100.00 against the owner.
   (g)   Violation. No person, corporation, business entity or owner of
property shall rent or let a rental unit unless he or she has first obtained a
valid rental or provisional rental license from the Code Official for said
unit. The occupation of a premises by a person other than the titled owner
coupled with the fact that the owner lists a different address as his or her
own in the records of the Office of the Mahoning County Auditor shall be prima
facie evidence that the premises is a rental unit being rented or let.
   (h)    Penalties. Any person, corporation, business entity or owner of
property who violates this section shall be subject to a penalty of $100.00 for
each week an unlicensed rental unit is being rented or let. In addition, any
violator of any provision of this section is subject to the penalties set forth
in Section
546.98. (Ord. 16-119. Passed 4-6-16.)
   546.12 RESPONSIBILITIES OF OCCUPANTS OF RENTAL UNITS.

   (b)   Access by Owner or Operator. Every occupant of a rental unit shall
give the owner or operator thereof, his agent or employee, access to any part
of a structure or premises, dwelling, dwelling unit or rooming unit at
reasonable times for the purpose of permitting such inspections, maintenance,
repairs or alterations as are necessary to comply with the provisions of this
code. Except in the case of emergency, or if it is impracticable to do so, the
owner or operator must give the occupant reasonable notice of the intent to
enter. Twenty-four hours is presumed to be reasonable notice, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary.
   (c)   Violation of any provision of this section is also a violation of this
code and is also subject to the penalties set forth in Section
546.96 and
546.98.
(Ord. 16-119. Passed 4-6-16.)
   546.13 VACANT PROPERTY REGISTRY.
   (a)    Adoption; Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish a
vacant property registration program and to regulate the maintenance of
properties which are in the foreclosure process, abandoned or vacant. This
Section is intended to reduce and prevent neighborhood blight, to avoid the
creation and maintenance of public nuisances, to ameliorate conditions that
threaten the public health, safety and welfare, to promote neighborhood
stability and occupancy by preserving the condition and appearance of
residential properties and the worth and activity of commercial and industrial
properties, and to maintain property values and assessments.
   (b)    Applicability. This Section shall be applicable to all residential,
commercial and industrial structures located within the City of Youngstown, but
does not apply to County Land Reutilization Corporations organized under
Chapter 1724 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)    Registration. The owner of any structure that is or has become vacant
as defined in Section
 546.02(e)(44) of this Code shall, within thirty (30) days after the structure
becomes vacant file a registration statement for each such structure with the
Code Official or his or her designee on forms provided for such purposes and
pay an annual registration fee.
      (1)    Registration Fee. The annual registration fee shall be one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for each residential structure and two hundred and fifty
dollars ($250.00) for each commercial or industrial structure; provided,
however, that all religious, educational, and charitable associations, and all
governmental agencies shall be exempt from the payment of the annual
registration fee. The registering party shall not be entitled to a refund of
any part of the registration fee should the structure no longer be deemed
vacant during the annual registration period.
      (2)    Registration Statement. The registration statement shall be deemed
prima facie proof of the statements therein contained in any administrative
enforcement proceeding or court proceeding instituted by the City against the
owner of the structure.
      (3)    Annual Registration Requirement. The registration statement shall
remain valid for one year from the date of registration. The registering party
shall be required to annually renew the registration so long as the structure
remains vacant.
      (4)    Authorized Agent. In addition to other information required by the
Code Official, the registration shall include the name, street address and
telephone number of a natural person twenty-one years of age or older,
designated by the owner as the authorized agent for receiving notices of code
violations and for receiving process in any court proceeding or administrative
enforcement action on behalf of such owner in connection with the enforcement
of this code. This person must maintain an office in Mahoning County, Ohio. An
owner who is a natural person and who meets the requirements of this subsection
as to location of residence or office may designate himself or herself as the
agent. By designating an authorized agent under the provisions of this
subsection, the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of code
violations concerning the registered structure and all process in any court
proceeding or administrative enforcement action brought to enforce provisions
of this code concerning the registered structure by service on the authorized
agent. Any owner who has designated an authorized agent under the provisions of
this subsection shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's
designation until the owner notifies the Code Official or his or her designee
in writing of a change of authorized agent, or until the owner files a new
registration statement.
Any owner who fails to register a vacant structure under the provisions of this
subsection shall further be deemed to consent to receive, by posting at the
structure, any and all notices of code violations and all process in an
administrative action brought to enforce any provision of this code.
      (5)    Duty to Update Registration Information. The owner shall notify
the Code Official or his or her designee within twenty (20) days of any change
in the registration information by filing an amended registration statement on
a form provided for such purposes.
      (6)    Liability. An owner shall be liable under this section for failing
to register an authorized agent, failing to register a vacant structure,
failing to pay the appropriate annual registration fee, or failing to timely
update any change in registration. (Ord. 16-226. Passed 7-13-16.)
   (d)    Foreclosure Bond Registry. Any owner of a property which files a
foreclosure action against such property, or for which a foreclosure action is
pending, or a judgment of foreclosure has been issued shall, in addition to all
other requirements of this Section, provide a cash bond to the Deputy Director
of Public Works or his or her designee, in the sum of ten thousand dollars
($10,000.00), to secure the continued maintenance of the property throughout
its vacancy and remunerate the City for any fees owed and expenses incurred in
inspecting, securing, repairing and/ or making such building safe by any legal
means including, but not limited to, demolition. An administrative fee of
$100.00 per quarter will be deducted from the bond by the City for
administrative expenses including, but not limited to, the processing,
accounting and other related functions inherent in the administration of the
foreclosure bond. "Quarter" as used in this section refers to calendar
quarters, i.e.-January 1- March 31, April 1- June 30, July 1- September 30 and
October 1-December 31. The fee will be deducted if the bond is in the
possession of the City for the entire quarter, or any portion thereof. This fee
is in addition to all other allowable expenses charged off against the bond.
(Ord. 17-245. Passed 6-21-17.)
   (e)    Nuisance Abatement. In the event the City of Youngstown or one of its
contractors, due to a lack of response of an owner or agent, is required to
take action to abate a nuisance at a vacant property, the owner will be billed
for the cost of abatement in accordance with Section
546.99, or if the property is subject to a foreclosure bond, the bond will be
drawn upon to cover such costs.
   (f)    Penalty. Any owner who fails to comply with any provision of this
Section shall be subject to a fifty dollar ($50.00) per day administrative
penalty with a maximum penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or shall be
guilty of a third degree misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $500.00
or imprisoned more than 60 days or both.
   (g)    Appropriation of Fees Collected. All monies collected pursuant hereto
shall be used for the enforcement of the Property Maintenance Code of the City
of Youngstown.
   (h)    Severability. If any provision, paragraph, word or subsection of this
Section is invalidated by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
provisions, paragraphs, words, sections or subsections shall not be affected
and shall remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. 16-226. Passed 7-13-16.)
   546.14 SECURING VACANT STRUCTURES.
   (a)    Securing. All doors and windows of vacant residential and non-
residential structures shall be in compliance with this code, or otherwise
secured in accordance with Section
546.02(e)(35) of this Code.
   (b)    Temporary Safeguarding. When a vacant structure is not in compliance
with this Code or otherwise secured, and in the opinion of the Code Official,
it poses an imminent danger due to an unsafe condition, the Code Official may
order the securing of the structure to render such structure temporarily safe.
Such action may be taken without prior notice to the property owner to meet
such emergency.
   (c)    Costs. The costs of the temporary safeguarding shall be determined by
the Deputy Director of Public Works, and the cost list shall be on file in the
Department of Public Works. All costs associated with the temporary
safeguarding of the property will be recovered by the City in accordance with
Section
546.99.
   (d)    Appeals. All charges assessed pursuant hereto may be appealed to the
City of Youngstown Special Assessments Board within 30 days of receipt of
notice of the charges assessed. (Ord. 16-227. Passed 7-13-16.)
   546.15 RESERVED.
   EDITOR'S NOTE: This section is reserved for future legislation.
   546.16 QUALITY OF LIFE.
   (a)   Adoption; Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish Quality
of Life Provisions, and put into effect a ticketing system which will allow for
the issuance of tickets for nuisances and properties that are not properly
maintained, and/or address issues that contribute to the deterioration of
property values and general disorder in a community. These problems degrade the
physical appearance of the City, which reduces business and tax revenue
inhibiting economic development. The quality of life and community pride of the
citizens of Youngstown are negatively impacted by the occurrences and existence
of these activities. Recognizing that these are community problems, the purpose
of this ordinance is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the
City by helping to create a clean and safe environment for the citizens of
Youngstown.
   (b)    Non-exclusive Remedies. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to
waive, relieve or otherwise excuse any person, property owner or tenant from
compliance with all applicable codes, ordinances, statutes or laws. Nothing in
this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the enforcement of other provisions
of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Youngstown or the Ohio Revised Code,
and nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to relieve an owner or
interested party from duties imposed pursuant to any regulatory code,
ordinance, statute, or law of the City of Youngstown or State of Ohio.
   (c)    Applicability. This Chapter shall be applicable to all persons,
vacant properties, and residential, commercial, and industrial structures
located within the City of Youngstown. For purposes of this Chapter, "persons"
shall include individuals, partnerships, corporations, limited liability
companies, property management groups, and other legal entities.
   (d)    Quality of Life Violations. The Quality of Life Violations are as
follows. Refer to the specified Sections or Chapters of the Codified Ordinances

group because of race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, gender identity, place of birth, age, marital status or handicap
is inimical to our American tradition of equality, of opportunity for all, and
menaces peace and public welfare; that to eliminate such prejudice and
discrimination an instrumentality of government should be established through
which the residents of the City may be kept informed of denials within the City
of such equality of opportunity and may seek enforcement of the rights secured
by Sections
547.01 and
547.07 and of developments which promote such equality. From this
instrumentality the elected and appointed officials, and the departments of
this City may obtain expert advice and assistance in adopting those measures to
keep peace and good order and harmony among the residents of the City, to bring
about and maintain harmony, to avoid intergroup tensions, to promote tolerance
and goodwill and to ensure equality of treatment and of opportunity to all
regardless of race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry,
national origin, place of birth, age, marital status or handicap.

referred to as the complainant', that any person, referred to as the
"respondent", has engaged or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory
practices as defined in Sections
547.01 through
547.07, or upon its own initiative, in matters relating to such discriminatory
practices, the Human Relations Commission or a committee thereof designated
pursuant to Section
547.14(m) may initiate a preliminary investigation. The charge shall be filed
with the Commission within six months after the alleged unlawful discriminatory
practices are committed. If it determines after such investigation, that it is
not probable that unlawful discriminatory practices have been or are being
engaged in the Commission or its committee shall notify the complainant that it
has so determined and that it will not issue a complainant in the matter.
   (b)   If the Human Relations Commission or its committee determines, after
such investigation, that it is probable that unlawful discriminatory practices
have been or are being engaged in, it shall endeavor to eliminate such
practices by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion.
Nothing said or done during such endeavors shall be disclosed by any member of
the Commission, or its staff, or be used as evidence in any subsequent
proceeding. If after such investigation and conference, the Commission or its
committee is satisfied that any unlawful discriminatory practice of the
respondent will be eliminated, it may treat the complaint as conciliated. An
entry of such disposition shall be made on the records of the Commission.
   (c)   If the Human Relations Commission or its committee fails to effect the
elimination of such unlawful discriminatory practices and to obtain voluntary
compliance, or if the circumstances warrant, in advance of any such preliminary
investigation or endeavors, and if the Commission or its committee finds that
the complainant acted with intention of fulfilling any contracts or agreements
he was seeking, the Commission shall issue and cause to be served upon any
person or respondent a complaint stating the charges in that respect and
containing a notice of hearing before the Commission pursuant to Section
547.14, at a place therein fixed to be held not less than ten days after the
service of such complaint. The place of hearing shall be in the Municipal

issued within one year after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practices were
committed.
   (d)   Any such complaint may be amended by the Human Relations Commission or
a hearing examiner conducting the hearing, at any time prior to or during the
hearing based thereon. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer or
to amend the answer to the original or amended complaint, and to appear at such
hearing in person or by attorney or otherwise to examine and cross-examine
witnesses.
   (e)   The complainant shall be a party to the proceeding and any person who
is an indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement of the
question involved in a proceeding shall be joined. Any person who has or claims

presentation of oral or written arguments.

respondent, take into account all reliable, probative and substantial evidence,
statistical or otherwise, produced at the hearing which may tend to prove the
existence of a predetermined pattern of discriminatory practice; provided that
nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize or require
any person to observe the proportion, which persons of any race, color,
religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry or
place of birth bear to the total population or in accordance with any criterion
other than the individual qualifications of the applicant. (Ord. 16-446. Passed

reduced to writing and filed with the Human Relations Commission. Thereafter,
in its discretion, the Commission, upon notice to the complainant and to the
respondent with an opportunity to be present may take further testimony or hear
argument.
   (h)   No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself in any
hearing before the Human Relations Commission or the hearing examiner.
   (i) If upon all the reliable, probative and substantial evidence the Human
Relations Commission determines that the respondent has engaged in or is
engaging in, any unlawful discriminatory practice, whether against the
complainant or others, the Commission shall state its finding of fact and
conclusions of law, and shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent
an order requiring him to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory
practice, and to take such further affirmative or other action as will
effectuate the purposes of this chapter including but not limited to hiring,
reinstatement or upgrading of employees with, or without back pay, admission or
restoration to union membership, including a requirement for reports of the

   (j)   If the Human Relations Commission finds that no probable cause exists
for crediting the charges or, if upon all the evidence the Commission finds

of the Commission to resolve a complaint, or to enforce an order to cease and
desist issued pursuant to Section
547.18, the Law Director, whenever he deems necessary may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for an injunction directed against a respondent,
restraining him from taking any action which would prevent the Commission from
acting on a complaint or which would make any order issued by the Commission
meaningless or directing him to comply with a cease and desist order issued by
the Commission.
(Ord. 86-142. Passed 5-28-86.)
   547.20 CONTRACT AWARDING PROCEDURE.

effectiveness of such program in insuring minority group representation in all
trades and all phases of the bidder's operation. The Board may further give
consideration to whether the bidder is a minority-owned firm and the number of
minority persons such bidder employs.
(Ord. 86-142. Passed 5-28-86.)
   547.21 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY PROVISIONS REQUIRED.
   All contracts entered into by the City, involving the expenditure of the

Charter shall incorporate equal opportunity clauses, which shall read as
follows:
   (a)   The contractor or vendor shall not discriminate against any employee
or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sexual
orientation, gender identity, ancestry, national origin or place of birth. The
contractor or vendor shall take affirmative action in accordance with the terms
outlined in its proposal and the provisions of this contract to ensure that
applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
without regard to their race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender
identity, ancestry, national origin or place of birth. Such action shall
include, but not be limited to, the following: employment, upgrading, demotion
or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination;
rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training,
including apprenticeship. The contractor or vendor agrees to post in
conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants, notices to be
provided by the City setting forth the provisions of the nondiscrimination
clauses.
   (b)   The contractor or vendor shall in all solicitations or advertisements
for employees placed by or on behalf of the contractor or vendor, state that
all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without
regard to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry,
national origin or place of birth. (Ord. 16-447. Passed 12-21-16.)
   (c)   The contractor or vendor shall send to each labor union or
representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement
or other contract or understanding, a notice to be provided by the City
advising the labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's or
vendor's commitments and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places
available to employees and applicants for employment.
   (d)   The contractor or vendor shall comply with all rules, regulations and
relevant orders promulgated by the Human Relations Commission pursuant to its
duties created by ordinance.
   (e)   The contractor or vendor shall file, and shall cause each of his
subcontractors and material suppliers to file, compliance reports with the
Human Relations Commission as may be directed. Compliance reports shall be
filed within such times and shall contain such information as to the practices,
policies, programs and employment policies, programs and employment statistics
of the contractor vendor, material supplier or subcontractor and shall be in
such form as the Commission may prescribe.
   (f)   The contractor or vendor shall furnish all information and reports
required by this contract and by the rules, regulations and orders of the Human
Relations Commission pursuant hereto, and shall permit reasonable access to his
books, records and accounts by the Commission or its representative as
necessary for purposes of investigation to ascertain compliance with this
contract and rules, regulations and orders.
   (g)   In the event of the contractor's or vendor's failure to comply with
the equal employment opportunity and affirmative action provisions of the
contract including the affirmative action undertaking outlined in its proposal
or with any of the rules, regulations or orders herein referred to, it is
agreed that the City, at its option, may do any or all of the following:
      (1)   Cancel, terminate or suspend this contract, in whole or in part,
except if this contract constitutes a lease of real estate for a period
exceeding three years. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from
enforcing the terms and conditions of any such lease by injunction or other
appropriate relief.
      (2)   Declare the contractor or vendor ineligible for further City
contracts.
      (3)   Recover from the contractor or vendor by set-off against the unpaid
portion of the contract price or otherwise pursuant to this contract, the sum
of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty,
for each day that the contractor or vendor shall fail to comply with these
provisions of the contract, as determined by the Human Relations Commission in
accordance with its rules and regulations the sum being fixed and agreed upon
by and between the contractor and the City because of the impracticability and
extreme difficulty of fixing and ascertaining the actual damages which the City
would sustain in the event of such a breach of contract and that amount is
agreed to be the amount of damages which the City would sustain.
      (4)   Impose such other sanctions as may be imposed by the Human
Relations Commission pursuant to ordinances passed by Council, or seek such
other remedies as may be provided by law.
   (h)   The contractor or vendor shall include the provision of this contract
in every subcontract, so that such provisions shall be binding upon each
subcontractor. The contractor or vendor shall take such action with respect to
any subcontractors as the Human Relations Commission may direct as a means of
enforcing such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance. However, in
the event the contractor or vendor becomes involved in or is threatened with
litigation with a subcontractor as a result of such direction by the
Commission, the contractor or vendor may request the City to enter into such
litigation to protect the interests of the City.
      (Ord. 86-142. Passed 5-28-86.)
   547.22 ENFORCEMENT BY HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION.
   It shall be the duty of the Human Relations Commission to administer the
provisions of Section
547.21 by exercising a continuing review of the employment practices of the
contractors and vendors and taking such action as necessary to insure
compliance with the section, including, but not limited to, the following:
   (a)   The Human Relations Commission by its enforcement officer and/or other
authorized representative, shall investigate the employment practices of any
contractor, vendor, material supplier or subcontractor to determine whether or
not the contractual undertakings in regard to insuring equal employment
opportunities and affirmative action have been carried out in accordance with
the equal employment opportunity clause. The investigation shall be conducted
in accordance with the procedures herein set forth and the investigating
officer shall report to the Commission and the City department for which the
contract work is being performed.
   (b)   The Commission may, on its own initiative, or upon the request of a
contractor or vendor, submit to such contractor or vendor a proposed
affirmative action program designed by the Commission to prevent or eliminate
any discriminatory practices in recruitment and hiring and to assist such
contractor or vendor to comply with the terms of the contract and with any
ordinance requiring fair employment practices. Acceptance and implementation of
such an affirmative action program shall constitute compliance with the
contract and with such ordinance. However, the Commission may, as circumstances
warrant, revise and modify the affirmative action program from time to time in
order to accomplish the purpose of insuring that fair employment practices are
followed.
   (c)   The Commission shall receive and investigate or cause to be
investigated complaints by employees or prospective employees of any City
contractor, vendor, material supplier or subcontractor which allege actions
contrary to the contractual undertakings of the contractor, vendor, material
supplier or subcontractor.
   (d)   The Commission shall use its best efforts, directly and through the
contracting City departments, other interested federal, state and local
agencies, contractors and all other available instrumentalities, to cause any
labor union engaged in work under City contracts or any agency referring
workers or providing or in the course of such work to cooperate in the
implementation of the purposes of the equal employment and affirmative action
provisions of City contracts. The Commission shall, in appropriate cases,
notify the United States Department of Justice Ohio Fair Employment Practices
Commission or other appropriate agencies, whenever it has reason to believe
that the practices of any labor organization or agency violate Title VI or
Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Ohio Fair Employment Practices
Act, Ohio R.C. Chapter 4112 and Section
547.21 and such other relevant legislation as hereafter may be enacted by the
Congress of the United States, the General Assembly of the State or Council.
   (e)   The Commission may hold such hearings, public or private, as it may
deem advisable for compliance, enforcement or educational purposes.
   (f)   Where the Commission finds that a contractor, vendor, material
supplier or subcontractor has failed to comply with the equal employment
opportunity and affirmative action provisions of its contract, the Commission
may:
      (1)   Publish or cause to be published, the names of contractors or
unions which it has concluded have failed to comply with the provisions of the
contract.
      (2)   Recommend to the Department of Law that, in cases in which there is
substantial or material violation or the threat of substantial or material
violation of the contractual provisions, appropriate proceedings be brought to
enforce those provisions, including the enjoining, within the limitations of
applicable law, of organizations, individuals or groups who prevent, directly
or indirectly, compliance with those provisions.
      (3)   Recommend to the Department of Law that criminal proceedings be
brought for the furnishing of false information under oath to any City
department or the Commission, as the case may be.
      (4)   Recommend that the appropriate department cancel, terminate,
suspend or cause to be cancelled, terminated or suspended any contract or any
portion or portions thereof, for failure of the contractor, vendor, material
supplier or subcontractor to comply with the nondiscrimination provisions of
the contract. The Commission may recommend that a contract be cancelled,
terminated or suspended absolutely or that a continuance of a contract be
conditioned upon implementation of a program for future compliance approved by
the contracting department and the Commission.
      (5)   Recommend that any contracting department refrain from entering
into further contracts, or extension or other modifications of existing
contracts, with any noncomplying contractor, until the contractor has satisfied
the Commission that the contractor has established and will carry out personnel
and employment policies in compliance with the provisions of its contract.
   (g)   Whenever it becomes necessary to cancel or terminate a contract, or
whenever a contractor, vendor, material supplier or subcontractor has been
disqualified from further City contracts, because of noncompliance with the
contract provisions with regard to affirmative action to provide equal
employment opportunity, the Commission or the contracting department shall
promptly notify the Director of Finance. Any such disqualification may be
rescinded.
      (Ord. 86-142. Passed 5-28-86.)

   (c)   That the affirmative action program which the bidder or bidders
propose to undertake to insure that there will be minority group representation

contract compliance officer for information, advice and assistance in the
preparation of their proposal. An affirmative action program shall be
considered to be in compliance with this section if it includes provisions
consistent with the following guidelines:
      (1)   Use minority contractors as subcontractors;
      (2)   Employ representative numbers of minorities in all job
classifications, with any increase in the work force resulting from the project
bid upon being accompanied by a comparable increase in the number of minority
group employees;
      (3)   Establish timetables for achieving employment goals which are
directly related to the total work force;

   547.26 TIME FOR COMPLETION OF WORK; BONUS; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

Consumer sales practices - see Ohio R.C. Ch. 1345
   727.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Consumer transaction" means a sale, lease, assignment, award by
chance, or other transfer of any services and any property, tangible or
intangible, real, personal, or mixed, any franchise and any other article,
commodity, or thing of value wherever situated, to an individual for purposes
that are primarily personal, family or household, or that relate to any
business opportunity that requires both the consumer's expenditure of money or
property and the consumer's personal services on a continuing basis and in
which the consumer has not been previously engaged, or solicitation to supply
any of these things, except those transactions between persons defined in Ohio
R. C. 4905.03 and 5725.01, and their customers, or between attorneys or
physicians and their clients or patients.
   (b)   "Person" includes an individual, corporation, government, governmental
subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association
or cooperative, or any other legal entity.
   (c)   "Supplier" means a seller, lessor, assignor, franchiser, or other
person who is engaged in the business of effecting or soliciting consumer
transactions, whether or not he deals directly with the consumer.
   (d)   "Consumer" means a person who engages in a consumer transaction with a
supplier.
   (e)   "Knowledge" means awareness, but such actual awareness may be inferred
where objective manifestations indicate that the individual involved acted with
such awareness. (Ord. 91280. Passed 3-9-76.)
   727.02 DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES.
   (a)   No supplier shall commit a deceptive act or practice in connection
with a consumer transaction. Such deceptive act or practice by a supplier
violates this section whether it occurs before, during or after the
transaction.
   Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, an act or practice of a
supplier in representing any of the following is deceptive:
       (1)   That the subject of a consumer transaction has sponsorship,
approval, performance characteristics, accessories, uses or benefits it does
not have;
       (2)   That the subject of a consumer transaction is of a particular
standard, quality, grade, style, prescription or model if it is not;
       (3)   That the subject of a consumer transaction is new or unused, if it
is not;
       (4)   That the subject of a consumer transaction is available to the
consumer for a reason that does not exist;
       (5)   That the subject of a consumer transaction has been supplied in
accordance with a previous representation, if it has not, excepted that the act
of a supplier in furnishing similar merchandise of equal or greater value as a
good faith substitute does not violate this section;
       (6)   That replacement or repair is needed, if it is not;
       (7)   That a specific price advantage exists, if it does not;
       (8)   That the supplier has a sponsorship, approval or affiliation he
does not have;
       (9)   That a consumer transaction involves or does not involve a
warranty, a disclaimer of warranties, particular warranty terms, or other
rights, remedies or obligations if the representation is false;
      (10)   That goods or services will be supplied at an estimated price
given to the consumer to induce the transaction when in fact the actual charges
exceed by more than ten percent (10%), unless prior approval to exceed the
estimate is given to the supplier by the consumer.
   (b)   No supplier shall offer to a consumer or represent that a consumer
will receive a rebate, discount or other benefit as an inducement for entering
into a consumer transaction in return for giving the supplier the names of
prospective consumers, or otherwise helping the supplier to enter into other
consumer transactions, if earning the benefit is contingent upon an event
occurring after the consumer enters into the transaction. (Ord. 89127. Passed
4-2-75.)
   727.03 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The City hereby adopts and incorporates, by reference, as Appendix "A" to
Original Ordinance 80-334, the substantive rules and regulations which have
been adopted pursuant to the Ohio R. C. 1345.05(B)(2) by the State. A copy of
Appendix "A" may be obtained at the Clerk of Council office. (Ord. 80-334.
Passed 4-30-80.)
   727.04 UNCONSCIONABLE ACTS OR PRACTICES.
   No supplier shall commit an unconscionable act or practice in connection
with a consumer transaction. Such an unconscionable act or practice by a
supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during or after the
transaction.
   In determining whether an act or practice is unconscionable, the following
circumstances shall be taken into consideration:
   (a)   Whether the supplier has knowingly taken advantage of the inability of
the consumer reasonably to protect his interests because of his physical or
mental infirmities, ignorance, illiteracy or inability to understand the
language of an agreement;
   (b)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into that the price was substantially in excess of the price at which
similar property or services were readily obtainable in similar consumer
transactions by like consumers;
   (c)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into of the inability of the consumer to receive a substantial benefit
from the subject of the consumer transaction;
   (d)   Whether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was
entered into that there was no reasonable probability of payment of the
obligation in full by the consumer;
   (e)   Whether the supplier required the consumer to enter into a consumer
transaction on terms the supplier knew were substantially one-sided in favor of
the supplier;
   (f)   Whether the supplier knowingly made a misleading statement of opinion
on which the consumer was likely to rely to his detriment.
      (Ord. 89127. Passed 4-2-75.)
   727.05 DIRECTOR OF CONSUMER PROTECTION PROGRAM.
   (a) The Sealer of Weights and Measures or his representative, is hereby
authorized and directed to receive and investigate all complaints of unlawful,
deceptive and unconscionable practices under this chapter, and any violations
of federal, State and Municipal statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and
regulations affecting consumers. The Sealer of Weights and Measures may also
initiate an investigation of such practices if he has probable cause to believe
that such practice or violation has taken place.
   The Sealer may refer his findings to the Department of Law for whatever
legal action may be deemed warranted under the circumstances.
   (b) When the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs believes it would
be in the interest of the residents of the City, the Consumer Affairs Division
may receive, investigate and attempt to resolve complaints concerning consumer
transactions that take place beyond the limits of the City. The Consumer
Affairs Division may receive, investigate and attempt to resolve complaints
concerning transactions between utilities as defined in Ohio R. C. 4905.03 and
consumers, and between financial institutions, dealers in intangibles, and
insurance companies as defined in Ohio R. C. 5725.01 and consumers.
   (c)   In addition to any other powers vested in the Sealer of Weights and
Measures to enforce federal, State or local law, he shall have the following
powers and duties:
       (1)   Exercise general supervision over the personnel assigned to
enforce the laws pertaining to consumer protection.
       (2)   Submit to Council such legislation necessary and proper to
effectuate the consumer protection program of the City.
       (3)   Make appropriate studies, prepare short and long term plans for

       (4)   Attend public or private hearings of any public agency relating to
any aspect of consumer protection or other matters dealing with the
administration of this chapter.
       (5)   Collect and disseminate information and conduct educational

trade secrets obtained are properly safeguarded.
       (8)   Request, accept, receive and administer public grants, or other
funds as provided by rules, regulations and procedures of the City.
       (9)   Advise, inform, consult and cooperate with federal, State, and
local agencies, and with interested groups and persons on the subject of
consumer protection.
      (10)   In carrying out his duties, the Sealer or his representative,
shall not disclose publicly the identity of suppliers investigated unless the
identity of the supplier has become a matter of public record in hearings,
appeals, legal proceedings or in a written assurance of voluntary compliance.
This clause shall not be construed to prevent the release of information to
other governmental enforcement agencies, to apply to the compilation of studies
used by the Sealer on consumer investigations, or to apply to the release of
information about public utilities acquired either through the receipt of
complaints or through investigations.
   (d)   The Law Department shall assign an attorney as legal advisor to the
Division of Consumer Affairs. The Director of Consumer Affairs and Sealer of
Weights and Measures shall be located in the City Hall Building when space
becomes available or around the area where the Law Department is located. (Ord.
91280. Passed 3-9-76.)
   727.06 ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS.
   (a)   Whenever the Sealer has reasonable cause to believe that a violation
of this chapter exists or has occurred and in lieu of instituting or continuing
a court action pursuant to this chapter, the Sealer may cause written notice
thereof to be served upon the alleged violator and by conference and
consultation endeavor to persuade the violator to sign a written assurance of
voluntary compliance with this chapter. Such assurance may include a
stipulation for the restitution by the violator to the consumer of money,
property or other things received from them in connection with a violation of
this chapter. Violation of an assurance entered into pursuant to this section
shall be treated as a violation of this chapter, and shall be subject to all
the penalties provided therefor.
   (b)   If the alleged violator denies responsibility for the acts complained
of, if there is an emergency or other need for immediate action, or if the
Sealer is not able to amicably obtain written assurance of voluntary
compliance, he may appeal to the Director of Law upon written request to
initiate actions for injunctive or any other appropriate relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction to restrain a person from violating this chapter or the
rules or regulations pursuant thereto, and to restrain a supplier from engaging
in unfair, deceptive, fraudulent or unconscionable conduct with consumers. To
establish a cause of action under this chapter it need not be shown that
consumers are being or were actually damaged. (Ord. 89127. Passed 4-2-75.)
   727.07 ADVISORY COUNCIL ON CONSUMER AFFAIRS.
   (a)   There is hereby created an Advisory Council on Consumer Protection
which shall be known as the Advisory Council, consisting of interested
citizens.
   The Advisory Council shall be composed initially of the Monitoring and
Policy Committee as has been established by the Model Cities Consumer
Protection Program.
   The Advisory Council shall maintain an open door membership policy whereby
any concerned citizen may petition in writing to the Director of the Consumer
Protection Office for his membership. All such petitions shall be read before a
quorum of the Council and upon affirmative majority vote, shall constitute the
petitioners approval as a new member of the Council.
   (b)   The Advisory Council shall consist of not less than seven members, who
shall have the following qualifications, in addition to an adequate background
in a field relating to consumer protection problems:
      (1)   At least one member shall be an attorney.
      (2)   At least one member shall be an accountant or person holding an
advanced degree in economics.
      (3)   At least one member shall have had at least five years business or
administrative experience in the ownership or management of a commercial
enterprise, or hold an advanced degree in business administration.
      (4)   At least two members shall be active in consumer affairs.
      (5)   At least two members shall be representatives of the general
public.
   (c)   The members of the Advisory Council shall serve without compensation
and not more than forty-nine percent (49%) shall have a substantial ownership
interest in any business subject to regulations by this chapter. The Advisory
Council may enact a constitution and by-laws to govern itself.
   (d)   The Advisory Council shall elect its own chairman. Any member of the
Council may be removed by a simple majority vote of the Advisory Council upon a
showing of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance. The nonattendance at
three consecutive Advisory Council meetings without good cause shall be
presumed to be such neglect of duty as to warrant removal. Meetings of the
Council shall be held at least once each calendar quarter at a time and place
to be designated by the chairman. The Sealer of Weights and Measures shall give
a report of his operations at such meetings.
   (e)   The duty of the Advisory Council shall be to consult with and advise
the Sealer, but not to direct his conduct of the Consumer Protection Program of
the City. The Advisory Council may make such recommendations as to operations
of the Consumer Protection Program and amendment of or additions to substantive
ordinances and regulations of the City as it deems appropriate in writing, and
a copy thereof shall be forwarded to the Mayor and Clerk of Council.
   (f)   The Advisory Council at the request of the Sealer or upon its own
initiative shall recommend to City Council or the Mayor for passage of rules,
regulations and ordinances declaring specific practices in consumer
transactions to be unconscionable or deceptive and prohibiting the use thereof.
In recommending such action, the Advisory Council shall consider among other
things:
      (1)   The degree to which the practice unfairly takes advantage of the
lack of knowledge, ability, experience or capacity of consumers;
      (2)   Knowledge by those engaging in the practices of the inability of
consumer to receive benefits properly anticipated from the goods or services
involved;
      (3)   Gross disparity between the price of goods or services and their
value as measured by the price at which similar goods or services are readily
obtainable by other consumers or by other tests of true value;
      (4)   The fact that the practice may enable suppliers to take advantage
of the inability of consumers reasonably to protect their interests by reason
of physical or mental infirmities, illiteracy or inability to understand the
language of the agreement, ignorance or lack of education, or similar factors;
      (5)   The degree to which terms of the transaction require consumers to
jeopardize money or property beyond the money or property immediately at issue
in the transaction;
      (6)   The degree to which the natural effect of the practice is to cause
or aid in causing consumers to misunderstand the true nature of the transaction
or their rights and duties thereunder;
      (7)   The extent or degree to which the writing purporting to evidence
the obligation of the consumer in the transaction contains terms or provisions
or authorizes practices prohibited by law; and
      (8)   Definitions of unconscionability in statutes, regulations, rulings
and decisions of legislative, administrative or judicial bodies in this State
or elsewhere.
   (g)   All meetings of the Advisory Council shall be open to the public, and
the Advisory Council may conduct such public hearings as it deems appropriate
dealing with all matters involving consumer protection.

and consumers for the consideration of the affairs of his division, and the
Sealer shall be chairman of such meetings.

transfer all fees paid through the Finance Director to the General Revenue Fund
of the City. (1967 Code §95.64)
   731.03  LICENSE EXPIRATION DATE; RENEWAL.
   All licenses shall expire as of July 1 next following the date of issuance
thereof unless renewed. At least thirty days prior to the expiration of any
license, the holder may make written application for renewal thereof,
accompanied by the three dollar ($3.00) license fee. If plans and
specifications of the bench, or advertising matter, or location of the bench,

applicant gives his name and address and the location of the bench for which
renewal license is desired. (1967 Code §95.65)
   731.04 LICENSE FOR EACH BENCH.
   If the application is for licenses for more than one bench at the same or

shall be valid only for the particular location designated therein. (1967 Code
§95.66)
   731.05 SALE OR TRANSFER OF BENCH.

new permit must be obtained for its maintenance. (1967 Code §95.67)
   731.06 LICENSE DENIAL AND REVOCATION.
   (a) The application for a bench license shall be denied if the Engineering
Commissioner finds that the maintenance of the bench would tend to obstruct
passage along any public way, or to create a hazard, or would otherwise be
detrimental to the public safety, welfare and convenience.
   (b) Any license may be revoked, or renewal thereof denied, for violation of
any provision of this chapter, for any fraud or misrepresentation in the
application, or for any reason which would have been grounds for the denial of
the application.
   (c) Any license issued under this chapter shall be cancelled and revoked if
the licensee fails to install the bench within sixty days after the date of the
issuance of the license.
   (d) The application shall be cancelled and denied or the permit revoked, as
the case may be, if sixty percent (60%) of the property owners and persons in
lawful control or having their places of business within 200 feet of the
location of the bench or benches protest the location of the same. (1967 Code §
   731.07 BOND OR PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE.
   (a) Before a license is issued, the applicant shall post or maintain with
the Finance Director a bond or policy of public liability insurance, approved
by the Law Director and conditioned substantially as follows: that the licensee
shall indemnify and save harmless the City, its officers, agents and employees
from any and all loss, costs, damages, expenses or liability which may result
from or arise out of the granting of such license, or the installation or
maintenance of such bench for which a license is issued, regardless of the
point to which such bench or benches may be moved within the City, with or
without the consent of the licensee, and that the licensee will pay any and all
loss or damages that may be sustained by any person as a result of, or which
may be caused by, or arise out of, such installation or maintenance. The bond
or policy of insurance shall be maintained in its original amount by the
licensee at his expense at all times during the period for which the license is
in effect. In the event that two or more licenses are issued to one licensee,
one such bond or policy of insurance may be furnished to cover two or more
benches, and each bond or policy shall be of a type where coverage shall
automatically be restored after the occurrence of any accident or loss from
which liability may thereafter accrue.
   (b) The limit of liability upon any bond or policy so posted shall in no
case be less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for a loss, bodily
injuries to or death occurring to one person or arising out of any one
accident, and three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for each additional
injury or death in such accident. (1967 Code §95.69)
   731.08 LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE.
   (a) When a license is issued, each such courtesy bench shall be installed
parallel with the curb and set back, more or less, eighteen inches from the
face of the curb.
   (b) Each bench shall meet requirements established by the Engineering
Commissioner in respect to safety and appearance, and failure to meet such
requirements shall be cause for the denial of the application or revocation of
the same if it has been issued.
   (c) The licensee shall maintain each bench at all times in a safe condition
in its proper and lawful location and shall inspect each bench at least weekly,
in order that it may be properly maintained. Benches shall be kept at all times
in a neat, clean and usable condition. Ice and snow shall be removed from the
benches, and the vicinity thereof, in such a manner that each bench shall be
accessible at all times. (1967 Code §95.70)
   731.09 ADVERTISING.
   (a) No advertising matter or sign whatever shall be displayed upon any

obscene, immoral or indecent advertising shall be permitted, and all
advertising shall be subject to the approval of the Engineering Commissioner.
   (b) No advertising matter or sign on any bench shall display the words
"Stop", "Look", "Drive-In", "Danger", or any other word, phrase or symbol which
might interfere with, mislead or distract traffic. (1967 Code §95.71)

so within ten days after written notice given by mail directed to the address
of the licensee on file, and if the licensee fails to pay the cost of removal
and storage thereof within a period of sixty days after the giving of such
notice, the licensee's rights in such bench shall be forfeited, but such
forfeiture shall not excuse the licensee from the payment of the cost of
removal and storage of such bench.
(1967 Code §95.72)
   731.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor of

   743.01 TYPES OF SALES; PURPOSES.
   Public auctions, going-out-of-business sales and distress merchandise sales
of any nature are injurious to the peace, health and welfare of the community.
When employed as an established merchandising practice, these sales cause
irreparable injury to merchants not employing such devices, render uncertain
the conditions of employment in retail establishments, reduce the value of
public property in the community and foster destructive and unfair competition
in the business community. These sales, when they are conducted as established
practice, involve an unusual hazard of fraud and misrepresentation.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to prohibit public auctions, going-out-of-
business sales and distress merchandise sales as established merchandising
practice and to require such sales to be licensed limiting going-out-of-
business sales and public auctions solely to the purpose of liquidating estates
and/or businesses. (1967 Code §115.17)

   (b)   "Distress merchandise sale" means any offer to sell, or sale to the
public of goods, wares or merchandise on the implied or direct representation

distress merchandise sales shall include but not limited to any sale advertised
either specifically or in substance to be any one of the following:
      (1)   Fire sale;
      (2)   Smoke and/or water damage sale;
      (3)   Adjustment sale;
      (4)   Insurance salvage sale;
      (5)   Mortgage sale;
      (6)   Adjustor's sale;
      (7)   Reorganization sale; or
      (8)   Other terminology of similar intent to any of the above.
   (c)   "Going out of business" means a sale, offering for sale or advertising
for sale of goods, wares or merchandise to the ultimate consumer, where the
offeror or owner implies, or the consumer is reasonably led by the offeror or
owner to believe that the owner or offeror will no longer continue to engage in
such business at its present location. The owner may continue the use of such
name at a different location within the City only if the name has been and is
presently being used at the different location.
      If the person, firm or corporation has been operating two or more
business establishments at different locations within the City, the person,
firm or corporation may continue to operate the business establishments under
the same name in all of the locations other than the locations wherein such
person, firm or corporation is going out of business under this section or
without complying with the one-year clause referred to hereinafter.
   (d)   "Going-out-of-business sale" means any offer to sell to the public or
a sale to the public of goods, wares or merchandise on the implied or direct
representation that such sale is in anticipation of a business termination at

746 as it applies to such merchandise only. However, only the license under
this chapter shall be required when the merchandise constitutes no more than

the investigation, preparing afterward a written report in which he shall
include his recommendations. The report shall be filed with the Mayor prior to
the hearing described in Section
743.08. The applicant and/or his lawyer may cross-examine the Law Director
concerning the report and recommendations during the hearing. If requested by
the Law Director, in the furtherance of the investigation, the Mayor shall

books and records of the applicant, taking any inventory at the applicant's
place of business, including his warehouses. The findings shall be made a part
of the report.
   (b) Information secured by the Law Director in the course of investigation
shall not be made public except upon the written permission of the applicant or
on appeal by the applicant from a refusal by the Mayor to issue a license.
However, the report shall be introduced in the record of the hearing.
   (c) An applicant's refusal to permit examination of his books and records or
his goods, wares and merchandise is ground for the Mayor's refusal to issue a

two weeks after an application has been filed. At least three days prior to the

   743.12 BONA-FIDE MERCHANT.
   No license for a public auction, going-out-of-business sale or distress
merchandise sale shall be issued for the sale of goods, wares or merchandise of
an applicant other than to a bona-fide merchant of the City. No license shall
be granted to an applicant who sets up an establishment or to an applicant who

of conducting a public auction, going-out-of-business sale or distress
merchandise sale. (1967 Code §115.28)

   A licensee shall file with the Mayor a daily report of merchandise received.
The report shall show the quantity, kind and grade of each item received,

Code §115.37)
   743.22 REGULATIONS.

general circulation. (1967 Code §115.38)
   743.23 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE.
   The Mayor may revoke or suspend a license granted under authority of this

goods, wares or merchandise in addition to those permitted under Section
743.17, or violates any requirement or provision hereof or any law relating to
the business so licensed or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of this
chapter. (1967 Code §115.39)
   743.24 APPEAL.
   In case the Mayor refuses to issue a license or revokes or suspends a

   (a) A sale or offering for sale to the highest bidder of any gold, silver,
plated ware, precious stones, watches, clocks, jewelry or like merchandise, in
any building, or in any of the streets or alleys, or in any other public place,
where any and all persons who choose are permitted to attend and offer bids,
shall be deemed to constitute a public auction within the meaning of this
chapter.
   (b) A "going-out-of-business sale" of or in respect to a jewelry store or
establishment, wholesale or retail, whereby any of the merchandise listed in
subsection (a) hereof is offered for sale to the public or to the ultimate
consumer, shall, within the meaning, requirements and provisions of this
chapter, and wherever used in this chapter, include any sale or announcement,
advertisement or offering for sale termed, described or referred to directly or
indirectly, in form or in substance, as "removal", "loss", "termination, loss
or expiration of lease", "closing out", "liquidation creditors", "damaged
goods", "forced sale", "distressed stock", or by any other terms which shall
reasonably lead the public to believe that the owner or offeror of such
merchandise either by choice or necessity will no longer continue to engage in
such business or that such sale is other than the usual and ordinary course of
business.
   (c) By the words "stock on hand", as herein used, is meant such gold,
silver, plated ware, precious stones, watches, clocks or jewelry which a
merchant usually and ordinarily carries through the year, and does not include
gold, silver, plated ware, precious stones, watches, clocks, jewelry or like
merchandise, purchased or otherwise acquired especially and purposely for sales
at public auction or for a going-out-of-business sale.
   (d) It is hereby declared the legislative intent that jewelry auction sales
or going-out-of business sales, as herein defined, shall be held only to
liquidate estates, businesses and to avoid bankruptcy or the like, and shall
not be permitted as an established merchandising practice.
(Ord. 57049. Passed 7-16-53.)
   746.02 LICENSE REQUIRED.
   No person shall sell or offer for sale at public auction, or as a going-out-
of-business sale as defined in Section
746.01(b), any gold, silver, plated ware, precious stones, watches, clocks,
jewelry or like merchandise, whether the same be his property or that of
another, unless licensed so to do as hereinafter provided. Nothing in this
chapter shall be deemed to apply to any person executing a process or order of
a court of competent jurisdiction, nor to licensed pawnbrokers or loan
companies selling or offering for sale unredeemed pledges or chattels in the
manner provided by law. (Ord. 57049. Passed 7-16-53.)
   746.03 APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSE.
   An applicant for a license required by Section

upon forms prescribed by the Mayor, which shall include, in addition to the
name and address of the applicant, and the location and time of the proposed

operations hereby licensed. Any purchaser claiming to have been damaged by
misrepresentation in such auction sale or going-out-of-business sale may
maintain an action at law against such licensee, making such

the bond as herein provided. (Ord. 57049. Passed 7-16-53.)
   746.05 HEARING.
   Upon receipt of any such application the Mayor shall set a time and place
for public hearing thereon not later than two weeks thereafter, notice of which
hearing shall be published in a local newspaper of general circulation. When
satisfied as a result of such public hearing or otherwise that neither any
fraud nor deception in the conduct of the sale or in the advertising thereof,
nor any misrepresentation of the goods to be sold, is intended or will be
practiced, the Mayor upon receipt of the bond required by Section
746.04, duly approved by the Director of Law as to form and the Director of
Finance as to sufficiency, shall issue to the applicant a license for which
application has been made. The license fee shall be one hundred dollars
($100.00) for the first thirty days or less and a renewal fee of one hundred

   746.06 DENIAL OF LICENSE.
   No such sale by auction or going-out-of-business sale shall be licensed or
held in the month of December. No such sale by auction or going-out-of-business
sale shall be licensed or permitted for a period of more than thirty days,
Sundays and legal holidays excepted. Such thirty days shall be consecutive
except as to Sundays and legal holidays, and from December 1, to December 31,
inclusive, except that if the licensee does not sell the quantity of
merchandise permitted under Section

such sale by auction, or going-out-of-business sale shall be held or open for
business between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. of the following morning
under any circumstances, and no license shall permit any such thing to be done.
No license hereunder shall be issued for the sale of stock on hand of any
person who has not, for the period of one year next preceding such sale, been
continuously engaged in the City in the business of selling such merchandise at
wholesale or retail nor shall a license be issued for the sale or offering for
sale at public auction or going-out-of-business sale of stock on hand by any

label containing a true and correct statement plainly written or printed in
English, specifying the kind and quality of the metal of which such article is
made or composed, or the percentage or karat or purity of such metal. If such
articles are plated or overlaid, then such tag or label shall contain a true
statement of the kind of plate. When precious stones are for sale or sold by
auction or going-out-of-business sale as such or as part of an article of
jewelry, such written statement shall set forth the true name of such stones.
When imitations of precious or semiprecious stones are offered for sale or sold
by auction or going-out-of-business sale as such or as part of an article of
jewelry, such imitations shall be described or defined as synthetic or
imitations of such stones as they purport to represent. When watches and clocks
are sold, the true names of the manufacturers shall state in writing and no
parts of the movement or mechanism thereof shall be substituted or contain
false and misleading names or trade marks, neither shall secondhand or old
movements be offered for sale in new cases without a true statement to that
effect. Used and rebuilt watches should be so indicated by tag or label. Such
tag or label shall remain securely attached to any such article or merchandise,
shall be delivered to the purchaser as a true and correct description and
representation of the article sold, and shall be deemed prima-facie evidence of
intent to defraud in case such written statement is not true and the correct
description and representation of such articles sold.

years the inventory offered for sale at auction or going-out-of-business sale
shall not exceed by fifty percent (50%) the average inventory carried for the
period of time applicant has been in business. Any abnormal purchases during

issue a license. (Ord. 57049. Passed 7-16-53.)
   746.09 MISREPRESENTATION.
   No licensee, his agents or employees shall make any statements which are

   753.05 INTERNET GAME CAFES AND SWEEPSTAKES BUSINESSES.
   (a)    Definitions:
      (1)   “Internet Game Café” means any business, establishment, room or
place where entertainment devices are kept for use by the public or by persons
other than the owner of the devices, where persons give anything of value to
access the use of the entertainment devices or the premises, and the person may
be given anything of value by the operator whether the giving occurs on or off
the premises or at the same or a later time.
      (2)   “Entertainment Device” means any mechanical, electronic, video or
digital device that is capable of accepting anything of value, directly or
indirectly, from or on behalf of a person, for the purpose of playing a game,
viewing a video display, hearing an audio transmission or reading entries or
outcomes from any other kind of device. "Entertainment device" does not include
any vending maching, juke box, audio book, video player or any device that
gives anything of value where the only value given, directly or indirectly, is
a video or audio transmission or the playing of a game.
      (3)   “Anything of Value” means any cash, cash equivalents, tangible
objects, credits to play, sweepstakes entry points and any tangibles, no matter
how slight. “Anything of value” includes playing a game, viewing a video
display, hearing an audio transmission, and reading entries or outcomes from
any other kind of device. A person who gives anything of value for a product or
service, whether tangible or intangible, in any way, directly or indirectly, in
association with being given access to the use of an entertainment device, is
deemed to have given value for the access to the entertainment device.
      (4)   “Sweepstakes Business” means any privately owned business operating
in the City of Youngstown where adults may purchase a product for value that
enters the adult into a lottery with a predetermined winner or in which skill
does not determine the winner, or any other Schemes of Chance. The purchase of
the product gives the adult credits to play computer based games necessary to
win the lottery. The number of credits provided by the purchase is directly
correlated to the value of the purchase. A business which provides the
opportunity to play a machine/computer based game for the purpose of
discovering lottery results is also a sweepstakes business, even if the
purchase of a product does not require participation in the computer game for
entry to win.
      (5)   “Owner” or “Operator” means the person or business entity that owns
or leases premises to operate an internet game cafe or sweepstakes business on
those premises and receives any or all profits from the business.
      (6)   “Principals in a Business Venture” include all partners, officers,
and major shareholders.
      (7)   “On-Site Manager” means the person in charge of operating and
carrying out the day to day management of an internet game cafe or sweepstakes
business at the permitted location.
   (b)    Licensing and Fees. Any owner or operator of an Internet Game Cafe or
Sweepstakes Business shall annually apply for a permit to operate within the
City. If the business or cafe contains fewer than 4 machines and/or computers,
then the operator shall apply for a permit for each public machine and/or
computer in the amount of $250 per device. Should the business or cafe contain
four or more machines and/or computers, but fewer than 100 machines and/or
computers, then the owner shall pay $4,000 annually for a permit to operate as
an Internet Game Cafe or Sweepstakes Business. If the business or cafe contains
more than 100 machines and/or computers, the owner or operator shall pay $6,000
annually for a permit to operate as an Internet Game Café or Sweepstakes
Business.
   Every Internet Game Cafe or Sweepstakes Business shall pay a semiannual tax
of $25 per machine and/or computer payable on the first Monday of January and
the first Monday of July every year. Should the business cease to operate, the
tax will be prorated for the period that the machines and/ or computers were in
use.

partnership, corporation or other joint venture and listing the names of all

games which will be operated by the applicant as part of a Sweepstakes Business

business venture in which two or more parties are principals, all principals
shall be required to submit to a background check to verify that he/she is not
a person prohibited from being issued a permit under this section. If the
Applicant is not the actual on-site manager of the internet cafe for which the
permit is issued, then the manager of such cafe shall be required to submit to
a background check as well.
The cost of background checks required herein is to be paid by the Applicant.
   Each applicant shall be required to list all machines and/or computers being
operated or to be operated by the applicant, such list to include the following
information:

operated or to operate as a skill based game or scheme of chance;

pursuant to subsection (b) hereof becomes ineligible to hold such a permit due
to a conviction for any of the offenses set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6)
above, that permit shall result in immediate revocation of the permit holder's
permit as of the date of conviction. Continued operation of an Internet Game

other remedies at the disposal of the City of Youngstown.

occupied for an unlicensed Internet Game Cafe or Sweepstakes Business.
      (3)    No person, being the owner or lessee, or having custody, control,

licensee with the consent of the City of the bonds or policies of insurance
required in the preceding section in lieu of such agreement, an appraisal shall
be made of all claims pending against the licensee and a sufficient amount of
such cash or collateral deposited shall be retained as will guarantee the
payment of such claims. The balance of the fund, from time to time, shall be
returned to the licensee or his proper agent in proportion to the amount that
it shall be shown upon satisfactory proof that outstanding claims have been
paid or satisfied.
   In case of dispute over such appraisal or the determination of the amount to
be retained by the City, the matter shall be submitted for arbitration to a
judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the County, whose decision shall be
binding upon all parties.
   The City shall not be obligated to pay interest upon funds so deposited, nor
shall the City be entitled to the accruals upon any collateral deposited under
such agreement so long as there is no default on the obligation of the licensee
under such agreement.
   In the event that the applicant for a license or the renewal thereof, or any
licensee thereunder shall elect to take advantage of the provisions of this
section, he shall be entitled to a cancellation and release of any bond or
policy of insurance theretofore furnished under the provisions of Section
785.04, and the Law Director shall cause the cancellation and releases to be
executed and delivered to him. (1967 Code §117.05)

   No charge shall be made for the time lost through interruption of street

hiring the conveyance and this shall apply to each person or party bound for
separate and distinctly different destination, unless some members of a
distinct party shall desire to be discharged at some nearer or closer point
than that to which the other member or members of his distinct party is bound.
In this event, the party so discharged shall, at all times, be considered a

   (e)   Treatment of Industrial Wastes. The admission into the public sewers
of any waters, wastes, compatible and/or incompatible pollutants having a five
day Biochemical Oxygen Demand greater than 210 mg/l; or containing more than
240 mg/l of suspended solids; or containing any quantity of substance having
the characteristics described in subsection (c) hereof; or an average daily
flow greater than two percent (2%) of the average daily sewage flow of the
system, shall be subject to the review and approval of the Engineer.
   The Engineer has the right to reject any and all wastes which in his opinion
may be harmful to or exceed capacities of the sewage collection system and/or
the sewage treatment plant.
   Where necessary, based upon Federal guidelines for the pretreatment of
pollutants and in the opinion of the Engineer, the owner shall provide at his
own expense, such pretreatment as may be necessary to reduce the Biochemical
Oxygen Demand to 210 mg/l or less and the suspended solids to 240 mg/l or less;
or reduce objectionable characteristics or constituents to within the maximum
limits provided for in subsection (c) hereof; or control the quantities and
rates of discharge of such waters or wastes.
   Plans, specifications and/or other pertinent information relating to
proposed pretreatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of the
Engineer, the Boards of Health and the Ohio EPA and no construction of such
facilities shall be commenced until such approvals are obtained in writing and

costs relating to such plans, specifications, construction, rights of way,
etc., shall be borne by the owner.
   When determined by the Engineer that a discharge of industrial wastes with
concentrations exceeding the normal strength limitations can be satisfactorily
treated without adverse effects to the collection and/or treatment systems,
such wastes may be discharged subject to limitations determined by the
Engineer.
   The discharge of such wastes exceeding normal strength shall be subject to
and require a surcharge to compensate the Agency for all costs associated with
the collection, conveyance, treatment and final disposal for all excess
concentrations as hereinafter provided in Section
935.17.
   (f)   Joint Treatment Required. All major contributing industries shall be
required to enter into a contractual arrangement with the Agency to provide for
joint treatment. Such contractual arrangements and joint treatment shall comply
with the provisions of subsection (e) hereof.
   (g)   Industrial Flows and Loads Measuring and Control Devices Required.
Where required by the Engineer, the owner of any property served by a building
sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications
satisfactory to the Engineer or approved by him. The manhole shall be installed
by the owner at his own expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be
safe and accessible at all times and shall be subject to inspection at any
time.
   The Engineer may require, if he deems necessary, shut-off valves on all
industrial connections to the sewer system. The furnishing and installing of
such shut-off valves to be at the expense of the industry making the
connection. The valve will be controlled only by the Engineer or his authorized
personnel.
   The Engineer may require, if he deems necessary, a nonclog type of measuring
and transmission device or other approved measuring and transmission device to
be installed on all industrial discharge lines connected to the sewer system.
The installation, maintenance and telemetering of this equipment shall be
approved by the Engineer and all costs and expense therefor shall be borne by
the industry discharging the industrial wastes.
   (h)   Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage. All
measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to
which reference is made in subsection (c) and (e) hereof, shall be determined
in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency Test Procedures for
Analysis of Pollutants (Ref. FR 10-16-73, Vol. 38, No. 199, Part 11) and the
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage" and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided for in subsection (g) hereof, or
upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. In the event that no
special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to
be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the
building sewer is connected. The costs of such measurements, tests and analysis
shall be at the owner's expense.
   (i)   Rights, Restrictions and Violations.
      (1)   The Engineer reserves the right to limit or prohibit any new sewer
connection if it will cause the available capacity to be exceeded in any part
of the sewage works, including treatment capacity for hydraulic load, BOD and
suspended solids.
      (2)   In cases of repeated violations, the Engineer may revoke the permit
for the discharge of wastes into the sewer system, and effect the
discontinuation of sewer service.
      (3)   Changes in any industrial process, from which the wastes are to be
discharged into the sewerage system, shall be brought to the attention of the
Engineer before the discharge is made.
      (4)   No statement contained in these regulations shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Engineer and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Engineer for treatment subject to payment therefor by
the Industrial concern.
   (j)   Discharge of Holding or Septic Tank Wastes into Public Sewer
Restricted. No person shall discharge any holding or septic tank waste into a
public sewer directly or indirectly unless he has been issued a permit by the
Agency. Unless otherwise allowed by the Agency, the terms and conditions of the
permit will state the specific location of discharge, the time of day the
discharge is to occur, the volume of the discharge and the wastewater
constituents and characteristics. If a permit is granted for discharge of such
waste into a public sewer, the user shall pay the applicable charges and fees
and shall meet such other conditions as required by the Agency. An exception to
the above is that no permit will be required for discharge of domestic wastes
from mobile home holding tanks provided that such discharges are made into an
Agency approved facility designed to receive such wastes.
   (k)   Sampling and Monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the public
sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of such wastes. Industrial waste containing
substances listed in subsection (c) hereof shall be sampled and monitored as
often as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer. The owner shall be
responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
   If the service is provided by the Agency, the person whose wastes are being
tested shall promptly reimburse the Agency for the taking of samples and/or
testing according to the fee schedule in effect at that time.
   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the
composition of the wastes. When required, the sampling shall be accomplished by
the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite
samples.
   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Engineer or authorized
representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of
samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time
the sample was taken.
   Continuous monitoring and recording of discharge flow pH values will be
required when in the opinion of the Engineer sufficient quantities of acid or
caustic materials which could damage the sewerage system are being used or
stored on the premises.
(Ord. 80-554. Passed 6-25-80.)
   931.06 PROTECTION FROM DAMAGE.
   (a)   Notification of Accidental Discharges. Users shall notify the
Wastewater Treatment System Superintendent immediately upon accidentally
discharging wastes in violation of this chapter to enable countermeasures to be
taken to minimize damage to the wastewater treatment system, treatment
processes and the receiving waters.
   This notification shall be followed, within five days of the date of
occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the causes of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrence.
   Such notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss
or damage to the sewer system, treatment plant or treatment process, or for any
fines imposed on the Agency on account thereof.
   (b)   Employees Informed of Accidental Discharges Requirements. In order
that employees of users be informed of Agency requirements, users shall make
available to their employees copies of this chapter together with such other
wastewater information and notices which may be furnished by the Agency from
time to time directed toward more effective water pollution control. A notice
shall be furnished and permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board advising
employees whom to call in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this
chapter.
   (c)   Accidental Discharge Preventative Measures. Any direct or indirect
connection or entry point for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user’s
plumbing or drainage system shall be eliminated. Where such action is
impractical or unreasonable the user shall appropriately label such entry
points to warn against discharge of such wastes in violation of this chapter.
   (d)   Damaging Treatment Work Prohibited. No unauthorized person shall
maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, cover,
obstruct access to, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the Agency’s treatment works. (Ord. 08-216. Passed
10-15-08.)
   931.07 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Engineer and other duly authorized employees of the City bearing proper
credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter upon all properties
for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling or testing in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 80-554. Passed 6-25-80.)
   931.08 SERVICE OUTSIDE CORPORATE LIMITS; CONTRACT WITH POLITICAL
SUBDIVISION.
   The Engineer is authorized to negotiate a contract, subject to final
approval by Council, with each benefited political subdivision now connected to
the City sewerage system for the treatment and disposal of its sewage and
industrial wastes. Contracts shall be based on the same conditions and charges
and contain the same date for starting the sewerage service charge set forth in
this chapter.
   In order that no advantage may accrue to any political subdivision now
connected to the City sewerage system, by reason of its delay in consummating a
contract with the City for treatment and disposal of its sewage and industrial
wastes, the sewerage service charge shall be made retroactive from the
effective date of the contract, to the effective date of Section
935.20.
   A contract with a political subdivision not now connected to the system
shall be made only by specific authority of Council. (Ord. 80-554. Passed 6-25-
80.)
   931.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   (1)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which no
other penalty is hereinafter provided for shall be served by the Agency with
written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable
time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within
the period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
      (2)   Whoever continues any violation beyond the time limit stated in
such notice is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. Each day such
violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates Section
931.04 is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
   (c)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall become liable to
the Agency for any expense, loss or damage to the wastewater treatment system
occasioned by the Agency and/or any other expense, loss or damage incurred by
the Agency by reason of and resulting from such violation.

      (Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.16 STANDARDS MODIFICATION.
   All categorical pretreatment standards presently in effect as hereafter
added or amended are hereby adopted by reference by the District as part of
these Regulations.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.17 COMPLIANCE DATE REPORT.
   Within ninety days following the date for final compliance by the discharger
with applicable pretreatment standards set forth in these Regulations or ninety
days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the District
facilities by a new discharger, any discharger subject to these Regulations
shall submit to the District a report indicating the nature and concentration
of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the
average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional user changes in commercial processes and/or
pretreatment are necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. See Section
932.33 regarding compliance schedule reports.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-96.)
   932.18 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   Any industrial user either subject to a categorical pretreatment standard or
considered to be a significant industrial user shall submit to the District
twice a year, unless required more frequently by the District, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances
in the effluent which are required by the wastewater discharge permit. The
sampling for this report shall take place in the months of June and December.
In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement provided, however, where cost or
feasibility conditions justify, the District may accept reports of average and
maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. Users claiming a zero
discharge for the reporting period, in lieu of this report, shall submit to the
District a certification statement indicating that they did not discharge any
process wastewater during the reporting period and/or complied with 40 CFR Part
403 - General Pretreatment Regulations. The District, for good cause shown
considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget
cycles or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of such
reports on months other than those specified above. Where required by the
wastewater discharge permit, the report shall include production and operating
data and the submission of documentation indicating compliance with narrative
limits (BMP’s) when determined to be necessary.
(Ord. 08-217. Passed 10-15-08.)
   932.19 MONITORING AND ANALYSIS.
   Any sampling or analysis done as part of the reports required in Sections
932.14,
 932.15, 
932.17 or
932.18 shall be performed as follows:
   (a)   For facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist, a
minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil
and grease, sulfide and volatile organics. For facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the District may authorize a lower minimum. For
all other pollutants, twenty-four hour composite samples shall be obtained
through flow proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The
District may waive flow proportional composite sampling for any industrial user
that demonstrates that flow proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases,
samplings may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling
techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples (composited) where the
user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the
effluent being discharged. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a twenty-four hour period may be composited prior to
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
   (b)   The industrial user shall perform a minimum of one representative
sampling event to comply with the requirements of this section.
   (c)   If sampling performed by the industrial user indicates a violation,
the user shall notify the District within twenty-four hours of becoming aware
of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the District within thirty days
after becoming aware of the violation. Where the District has assumed
responsibility for sampling in lieu of the industrial user, it is the District
that shall repeat the sampling and analysis within the thirty days of becoming
aware of the violation.
   (d)   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow, the type of sample and the
nature and concentration, or production and mass where required by the
District. The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed
in the wastewater discharge permit. All analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136
does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures
for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the Deputy Director.
   (e)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in Sections
932.14, 
932.15,
932.17 or
 932.18 monitors any pollutant in its process wastewater discharge at the
permitted monitoring location more frequently than required by the District,
using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring
shall be included in the report. (Ord. 08-217. Passed 10-15-08.)
   932.20 SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   Any reports required in Sections
932.14,
932.15,
932.17 or
932.18 shall include the certification statement as follows:
      "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage
the system or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information,
the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
   Furthermore, all reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user. If an authorization under Section
932.02(3) is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has
responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization
satisfying the requirements Section
932.02(3) shall be submitted to the District prior to or together with any
reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.21 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING; INSPECTION CHAMBERS MAY BE REQUIRED.
   All sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with
an opening sufficient to permit accurate sampling and gauging of the wastewater
flow, to assure compliance with these Regulations. The District may inspect the
facilities and the process and operation records of any discharger to determine
compliance with the requirements of these Regulations. The discharger shall
allow the District or its representatives, upon presentation of credentials of
identification, access to all process and operation documents and to enter upon
the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours for the purposes of
inspection, sampling or records examination. The District shall have the right
to set up on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. The
Deputy Director shall, at all times, have free access to the premises and
process and operation records of any user, and free access to the premises and
process and operation records of any person reasonably believed by the Deputy
Director to be a user or possible user, for the purpose of inspecting, sampling
or testing the discharge emanating therefrom, or any discharge which may
emanate therefrom in order to determine whether such discharge or potential
discharge is acceptable or unacceptable to the District. Where necessary, the
Deputy Director may require the owner of the premises which discharges to the
system to install a suitable inspection chamber together with such necessary
meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the discharge or potential discharge. Such
chambers, when required, shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved
by the Deputy Director. The chamber shall be installed at the owner's expense
and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
(Ord. 29-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.22 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data furnished to the District with respect to the nature
and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the discharger demonstrates that release of such
information would divulge information entitled to protection as trade secrets
or proprietary information. A request for confidential treatment shall be
submitted in writing to the District simultaneously with submission of the
specific record, report, or other information with documentation sufficient to
support that the record, report, or other information is confidential. Said
record, report, or other information shall be stamped “Confidential” in a
prominent place on the document. Wastewater constituents and characteristics
shall not be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by
the District as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental
agency until and unless a ten day notification is given to the discharger.
   No permitholder shall have a claim against the City for release of any
information as a condition of continuance of their permit.
(Ord. 08-217. Passed 10-15-08.)
   932.23 BYPASS.
   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. "Severe property
damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (b)   Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause an applicable pretreatment standard to be violated, but only if it also
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the District at least ten days before the date of
the bypass.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the District within
twenty-four hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission
shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and steps taken or
planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The District
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within twenty-four hours.
   (d)   Prohibition of Bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the District may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The District may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the District determines that it will meet the two
conditions listed in this subsection.
         (Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.24 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE IN DISCHARGE CHARACTERISTICS.
   All industrial users shall promptly notify the Director in advance of any
substantial changes in the volume or character of pollutants in their
discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
ENFORCEMENT
   932.25 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   The District by and through its Deputy Director, or other duly authorized
representative, may, for good cause shown, suspend the wastewater treatment
service, the wastewater discharge permit of a discharger and/or terminate water
service when it appears that actual or threatened discharge presents or may
present an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons,
substantial danger to the environment, interfere with the operation of the POTW
or violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this Code or any wastewater
discharge permit issued pursuant to this Code. Written notice of such
suspension shall be served upon the discharger by personal service. Any
discharger so notified of the suspension of the District's wastewater treatment
service and/or the discharger's wastewater discharge permit, shall within a
reasonable period of time as determined by the District, cease all discharges.
In the event the discharger fails to comply voluntarily with the suspension
notice within the time specified therein, the District shall, without further
notice to the discharger and without the scheduling of a show cause hearing,
immediately commence judicial proceedings to compel the discharger's compliance
with such suspension notice and to exact civil penalties, if any, which may be
due for or as a result of the discharger's noncompliance. The District may
reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the wastewater treatment
service and terminate any judicial proceedings pending upon submission of
written proof by the discharger that it has eliminated the noncomplying
discharge or conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger
as set forth above.
   Where the Deputy Director or other duly authorized representative of the
District finds that the emergency nature of the problem created by the
discharge requires immediate emergency suspension of service and discharge
permit, then such action shall be taken without prior notice. Notice of the
District's action shall be served upon the user within the shortest reasonable
time following the emergency action. (Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.26 REVOCATION OF PERMIT AND/OR TERMINATION OF TREATMENT SERVICES.
   The District, by and through its Deputy Director or other duly authorized
representative, may revoke the permit, terminate the wastewater treatment
services to any discharger or terminate water service to any discharger which
fails to:
      (1)   Report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Allow reasonable access to the discharger's premises or records by
representatives of the District for the purpose of inspection or monitoring as
required in Section
932.21; or
      (4)   Comply with the conditions of its wastewater discharge permit, or
this Code, or any final administrative or judicial order entered with respect
thereto.
      (5)   Pay any fines or fees levied pursuant to Section
932.34 or
932.11 within thirty days of receipt. All fines assessed pursuant to this
chapter shall be added to the water bill of the permitholder and nonpayment of
same may result in termination of water service.
         (Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.27 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION; ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUSTMENT.
   Whenever the District, by and through its Deputy Director or other duly
authorized representative, finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct
which justifies revocation of a wastewater discharge permit or termination of
treatment services, pursuant to Section
932.26 hereof, the District shall serve or cause to be served upon such
discharger a written notice either personally or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within thirty
days of the date of receipt of the notice, the Discharger shall respond
personally or in writing to the Deputy Director or other duly authorized
representative who caused such notice to be served, and shall thereby advise
the District of its position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter the
parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of the allegations and, where
necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.28 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   Where the violation of any requirement of this Code is not corrected by
timely compliance voluntarily or by means of administrative adjustment,
pursuant to Section
932.27 hereof, the District, by and through its Deputy Director or other duly
authorized representative, may order the discharger to show cause before the
Deputy Director of Public Service or his duly authorized representative, why
the proposed permit revocation and/or service termination action should not be
taken. A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal service,
or certified mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of
the hearing to be held regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement
action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the
discharger to show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before
the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized
representative of a discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the District, by and through its Deputy Director or other duly
authorized representative, who shall then enter appropriate orders with respect
to the alleged improper activities to the discharger. Appeal of such orders may
be taken by the discharger in accordance with Section
932.31. If no such appeal is taken, the District may seek enforcement of its
order by judicial proceeding as herein provided.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)
   932.29 JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS.
   The Law Director or other duly authorized attorney for the District may
commence civil proceedings in the appropriate local court seeking appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief against any discharger who fails to comply with
any final administrative order issued pursuant to either Section
932.28 or
932.31 or with any suspension notice issued by the District pursuant to Section
932.25. Such relief may include civil penalties, judgment for damages,
penalties, expenses and/or costs incurred by or charged to the District by or
as a result of any and all acts and/or omissions of the discharger as required,
prohibited or governed by this Code, and injunctive relief, whether temporary
or permanent, to suspend or terminate the activities and/or operations of the
discharger as may be necessary for the District to enforce the provisions of
this Code. The Law Director for the District or the prosecutor having
jurisdiction thereover may commence criminal proceedings in the appropriate
local court upon authorization from the District.
(Ord. 92-206. Passed 4-29-92.)

   (b)   For significant industrial users only, Technical Review Criteria (TRC)
violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more
of all of the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six-
month period equal or exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the
average limits or the instantaneous limit multiplied by the applicable TRC
(TRC= 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants
except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or
longer term average or instantaneous or of any other pretreatment standard or
requirement (e.g. narrative limits)) that the Director determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of the POTW personnel or the general public);
   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment of
human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or

delivered to the discharger personally or by certified mail, return receipt
requested. Additional fines of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
violation may be assessed if ordered after a show cause hearing addresses the
violations subjected to administrative fines. For the purposes of these
administrative fines, each day on which a violation occurs or continues shall
be deemed a separate and distinct offense. All administrative fines described
herein shall be added to the water bill of the permit holder and in addition to
all other remedies set forth herein, may result in termination of water
service.
(Ord. 99-19. Passed 1-20-99.)
   932.35 RECOVERY OF COSTS INCURRED BY THE DISTRICT.
   In addition to civil, administrative or criminal fines or penalties, any
discharger who violates any of the provisions of this Code, or any wastewater
discharge permit, or who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit
or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the District's wastewater
disposal system shall be liable to the District for any expense, loss or damage
caused by such violation or discharge. The District, by and through its Deputy
Director or other duly authorized representative shall bill the discharger for

   (a)   The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of operation
and maintenance of the treatment works within the Department's jurisdiction to
each user class in proportion to such user's contribution to the total
wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength, volume and
delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation and maintenance, including replacement costs to each user's class.
   (b)   The system of charges shall be reviewed annually and revised
periodically to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs.
   (c)   The system of charges shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the
costs of all treatment works operation and maintenance provided by the

Passed 6-25-80.)
   935.07 METERED SEWAGE FLOW.
   Unless as otherwise provided for hereinafter, all premises having a
connection with a publicly owned collection and treatment works or otherwise
discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly
or indirectly into such publicly owned collection and treatment works, shall at
the owner's expense, install sewage flow meters and waste load measuring and/or
sampling devices of equipment, material and structures satisfactory to the
Engineer. Such measured sewage flows and waste loads shall be the basis for
measuring the flows and loads under this chapter. (Ord. 80-556. Passed 6-25-
80.)
   935.08 NONMETERED SEWAGE FLOW.
   Any premises having a connection with the aforesaid sewer facilities, or
otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly into such sewers, but which the owner has elected not to
install, at his expense, sewage flow meters and waste loads measuring devices,
the Engineer based on a consideration of similar premises and uses, engineering
factors and other relevant matters, may estimate the amounts, flows and waste
loads of sewage, industrial wastes, water and/or other liquids and such
estimates shall be the basis for measuring the flows and loads under this
chapter. (Ord. 80-556. Passed 6-25-80.)
   935.09 METERED WATER SUPPLY.
   Any premises having a connection with the aforesaid sewer facilities, or
otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly into such sewers, and which such connection is supplied
by the City Water System, the volume of water consumption as measured by the
water meter shall be used to determine the appropriate charges under this
Chapter. (Ord. 80-556. Passed 6-25-80.)
   935.10 PORTION OF METERED WATER NOT ENTERING SEWER SYSTEM.
   In the event that the Engineer is satisfied that a portion of the water from
any source consumed upon any premises does not and cannot enter the aforesaid
sewers, then in such case the owner or other interested party may, at the
owner's or other interested party's expense, install and maintain such separate
metering devices as demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Engineer that
portion of the water so consumed which is discharged into the aforesaid sewers,
and such portion shall be the basis for measuring the flows and loads under
this chapter.
(Ord. 80-556. Passed 6-25-80.)
   935.11 NONMETERED WATER SUPPLY.
   Any premises having a connection with the aforesaid sewer facilities, or
otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly into such sewers, and which are supplied either all or
in part by a water source other than the City Water System, the Engineer, based
on the limitations set forth in Section
935.12 and on consideration of similar premises and uses, engineering factors
and other relevant matters, may estimate the monthly amount of water to provide
adequate water service and pressure to the premises for the purpose and period
for which nonmetered water is consumed and such estimate shall be the basis for
measuring the flow and loads under this chapter. If the owner of such premises
or other interested party elects to do so, he may install at his own expense
water meters satisfactory to the Engineer to the extent necessary to measure
all such supplies of water and the quantity of water consumed on the premises,
the aggregate amount disclosed by such meters shall be the basis for measuring
the flows and loads under this chapter.

which USEPA financial assistance is used and industrial cost recovery is
required, the final grant amount shall be divided by the ICRS period (30 years)
as defined in Section
931.01 (18) which produces the annual industrial cost recovery rate. The annual
rate is then divided by the respective annual capacity of the treatment works
to produce an incremental charge per unit of usage. The method for developing
ICR rates for the two general types of improvements is as follows:
   (a)   Collection System Improvements, Except Infiltration/Inflow Correction
or Treatment.
      (1) Final grant amount
       ——————————— = Annual ICR rate
       ICR period (30 years)
      (2) Annual ICR rate
       —————————————————————— = ICR charge per 1000 cf
       Annual Capacity of sewers into WWTP (1000 cf)
   (b)   Wastewater Treatment Plant Improvements.
      (1)   Allocate final grant by facility constructed
         A. Flow
         B. BOD removal
         C. SS removal
         D. Other pollutant removal or treatment related grant
      (2)   Divide the total grant amount and the individual facility grant
amounts B. through D. inclusive by ICR period (30 years) to obtain individual
ICR rates.
      (3)   Divide individual ICR rates by respective capacities of WWTP.
         A.   Annual ICR Total rate            ICR charge per 1000 cf for
—————————————— =   normal strength or less
            Annual WWTP capacity (1000 cf)      discharge
         B.   Annual ICR BOD rate            ICR charge per 100 lbs
———————————————— =   BOD in excess of 210
            Annual WWTP capacity (100 lbs BOD)   mg/l
         C.   Annual ICR SS rate            ICR charge per 100 lbs
———————————————— =    SS in excess of 240
            Annual WWTP capacity (100 lbs SS)      mg/l
         D.   Annual ICR "other" rate         ICR charge per
———————————————— =    unit other in
            Annual WWTP capacity (units of other)    excess of normal
                              limits
            (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.04 MEASUREMENT OF INDUSTRIAL FLOWS AND LOADINGS.
   For the purpose of establishing ICR payments, the methods and manner as
hereinbefore provided for in Section
931.05 (g) and (h) shall apply. (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.05 RIGHT-TO-SERVICE INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   Where any industrial user as defined in Section
939.02 has entered into agreement with the Agency to reserve capacity and
becomes a right-to-service user as defined in Section
931.01 (64), the ICR charges to such user shall be based on the capacity
reserved or measurements of usage in accordance with Section
939.04, whichever is greater. (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.06 NEW INDUSTRY.
   A new industry is one which connects to the treatment works after the ICRS
period has commenced. ICR payments by a new industry shall begin on the date
use is initiated and shall continue for the unexpired portion of the ICR period
or until the industry ceases use of the facility, whichever occurs first. (Ord.
80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.07 DISCONTINUANCE OF USE BY INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   If an industrial user discontinues use of the treatment works, including
termination of any agreement for reserve capacity, its payment for industrial
cost recovery will cease. There is no requirement for other industries
presently using the treatment works to assume the portion of the ICR payment
which is unrecovered due to the departure of an industrial user. Total ICR
recovered from an industry which discontinues use during the ICR period shall
be the federal cost of the capacity used multiplied by the ratio of its period
of use to the ICR period.
(Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.08 LUMP SUM INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY PAYMENTS.
   An industrial user may wish to fulfill its industrial cost recovery
obligation by making a lump sum payment for its entire share of the cost of
construction of the treatment works. Such payments may be accepted by the
Agency and either processed as a normal ICR payment or set aside in a separate
account to be drawn on annually for the remainder of the industrial cost
recovery period. Lump sum payments will not relieve an industrial user from the
obligation of making additional future payments should its wastewater flow or
load increase. Discounts from the total industrial cost recovery requirement
will not be given to industrial users making advanced ICR payments. Any
interest earned on ICR payments set aside will be recoverable in the same
manner as if the ICR payments were made as due (40 CFR 35.928-2(a)).
(Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.09 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   The development of ICR rates shall be open for review by all industrial
users affected. Once established, such ICR rates shall not be subject to change
and shall remain constant throughout respective ICR period.
   Any industrial user who disagrees with the results of metering and/or
monitoring of their industrial wastes may make a written appeal to the
Engineer. Any such written appeal shall include the owner's name, location of
industrial site and nature of appeal. The Engineer shall review or cause to be
reviewed any such appeal. The Engineer may then accept any evidence that may be
produced by the appellant in the form of additional measurements and testing
conducted by qualified persons of the appellant's choice and at the sole
expense of the appellant. Such independent tests shall be conducted as nearly
as possible to the same date and time as similar tests are conducted by the
Agency. The results of the two tests shall be compared and a mutual settlement
made. In the event mutual agreement is not made, the matter shall be referred
to the Engineer who shall make a final ruling in such dispute. (Ord. 80-557.
Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.10 INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY FUND ESTABLISHED.
   All moneys collected by or through the provisions of this chapter shall be
deposited in an Industrial Cost Recovery Fund, and shall be invested,
administered and disbursed in accordance with the United States Environmental
Protection Agency Guidelines (38 FR 22523) as follows:
   (a)   The moneys collected by the provisions of this chapter shall be

States Government or any agency thereof; or
      (3)   Shall deposit such amounts in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the United States Government or by obligations fully guaranteed
as to principal and interest by the United States Government or any agency
thereof.
   (c)   The charges set forth herein are in addition to the sewer use charges
as set forth in Chapter
935.
   (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.11 DISBURSEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY FUNDS.
   Final disbursement of funds collected through the Industrial Cost Recovery
System charges shall be as follows:
   (a)   The Finance Director shall on an annual basis return to the United
States Treasury fifty percent (50%) of the amounts recovered from the
industrial cost recovery charge during the preceding year along with any
interest earned thereon.
   (b)   Forty percent (40%) of such recovered amounts including any interest
earned thereon shall be used solely in accordance with paragraph 35.928 of the
Construction Grants Regulation, 38FR5328 (eligible costs of future sewerage
system improvements). The Finance Director shall obtain the approval of the
Regional Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency
prior to commitment of the retained amounts for any expansion and/or
reconstruction.
      (1)   Pending use of these moneys in the manner prescribed, the Finance
Director shall invest such funds and any interest earned thereon in accordance
with the provisions of Section
939.10(b).
   (c)   Ten percent (10%) of the remaining amount of the recovered sums,
together with any interest earned thereon shall be transferred to the Sewer
System Improvement Fund. (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-80.)
   939.12 CHARGES MAY CONSTITUTE A LIEN.
   Each charge levied pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a lien upon the
premises charged therewith, and if the same is not paid within ninety days
after it is due and payable, it shall be certified to the Auditor of the county
in which such premises is located, who shall place the same on the tax
duplicate with the interest and penalties allowed by law, and shall be
collected as other municipal taxes are recovered. (Ord. 80-557. Passed 6-25-
80.)
   939.13 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Engineer shall make and enforce such rules and regulations as he may
deem necessary for the enforcement of the provisions hereof, for the proper
determination and collection of the charges herein provided and for compliance
with the rules and regulations adopted by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. Such rules and regulations, when not repugnant to existing
ordinances of the City or laws of the State, shall have the same force and
effect as ordinances of Council. Any conflict shall be resolved in favor with
federal regulations.

   950.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Youngstown:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the City of Youngstown to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and groundwater recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the City of Youngstown's
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Mahoning County, and the
City of Youngstown shall comply with this regulation for linear projects within
public rights-of way (e.g. roadway and sidewalk projects).
   (e)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the City of Youngstown Department of Public Works or Ohio EPA.
Such projects must be designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and
the width of disturbance. Linear construction projects must comply with the
requirements of Chapter
952 Erosion and Sediment Control. (Ord. 22-344. Passed 9-21-22.)

         (Ord. 22-344. Passed 9-21-22.)
   950.10 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; to meet the requirements of the
Construction General Permit; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated SCMs that address degradation of water resources. The
SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the water resources receiving stormwater
discharges from the site. Acceptable SCMs shall:
         A.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project and complies with Chapter
1305, Flood Damage Prevention.
         B.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable. Where feasible, bioretention, permeable
pavement with infiltration, underground storage with infiltration, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins, and/or rainwater harvesting must be the water
quality SCMs used. Separate SCMs may be used for peak discharge control and
water quality treatment. The stormwater system must also meet any additional
green infrastructure regulations found on the City of Youngstown stormwater
website.
         C.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         D.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         E.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the City of Youngstown and Ohio EPA.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for
the development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities for phased projects: For multi-phase
projects, there must be a plan for overall phasing, and stormwater must be
controlled at each phase of the project. Applicant must demonstrate that the
performance standards are met via the installed SCMs for each phase and provide
plans to demonstrate full conversion from construction BMPs to post-
construction SCMs for each completed phase of construction.
      (5)   Stormwater facilities in water resources: SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
950.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
952, Erosion and Sediment Control, and Chapter
1305, Flood Damage Protection, all as determined by the City of Youngstown
Public Works Department.
      (6)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (7)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
950.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the City of Youngstown Public
Works Department that the site is part of a larger common plan of development
where the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by an
existing SCM, or if the stormwater management requirements for the site are
provided by SCMs defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan
approved by the City of Youngstown Public Works Department.
      (8)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the City of
Youngstown Public Works Department.
      (9)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the City of Youngstown,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership. SCMs serving single lots shall be
placed on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the
property owner.
      (10)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum extent practicable.
Such practices may include minimizing site grading and compaction; protecting
and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and existing vegetation and
vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction operations in order to
minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time, and designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing and grubbing practices; and
maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and through these areas. These
practices must be used wherever feasible at the discretion of the City of
Youngstown.
      (11)   Post-Construction Soil Restoration: Except for areas that will be
covered by impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil
moisture- holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be
restored to that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent
practicable. Areas that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer
removed should be amended using the soil profile restoration design criteria in
Rainwater and Land Development.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The City of Youngstown Public Works
Department may allow modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other
surface waters only if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all
appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other
applicable federal, state, and local agencies as required in Section
950.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Section
952, Erosion and Sediment Control, and Section
1305, Flood Damage Protection, all as determined by the City of Youngstown
Public Works Department. At a minimum, stream relocation designs must show how
the project will minimize changes to the vertical stability, floodplain form,
channel form, and habitat of upstream and downstream channels on and off the
property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities, or the stormwater
quality control facility shall be sized to treat the off-site flow.
Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved until it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City of Youngstown Public Works
Department that off-site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the
development site in a manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream
flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally binding mechanisms that prohibit regrading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. The sheet flow
length shall not exceed 75 feet from impervious area or 150 feet from pervious
areas. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or other SCMs
from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as determined
by the City of Youngstown Public Works Department.
      (4)   Storm drainage systems: The following criteria shall be used to
design storm sewer systems:
         A.   Storm sewers shall be designed to meet the requirements presented
in latest revision of the Mahoning County Drainage Criteria and Storm Water
Manual.
         B.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the City of Youngstown Public Works Department.
         C.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         D.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         E.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (5)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the City of Youngstown:
         A.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
meet the requirements presented in latest revision of the Mahoning County
Drainage Criteria and Stormwater Manual.
         B.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high-water
mark.
         C.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one (1) foot of box
culverts and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must be sized to carry the twenty-five (25) year storm under these
conditions.
         D.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be twelve (12) inches.
         E.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10-
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         F.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         G.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         H.   Streams with a drainage area of five (5) square miles or larger
shall incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict
head loss differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-
year storm event.
         I.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100-year,
twenty-four (24) hour storm, or the 100-year flood elevation as determined by
FEMA, whichever is more restrictive.
      (6)   Overland flooding: Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100-year, 24-hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least two feet below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (7)   Velocity dissipation: Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more SCMs that meet or exceed the criteria in the Construction
General Permit.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms except the one (1) year storm occurring under post-
development conditions shall not exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from
a two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour storm occurring on the same development
drainage area under pre-development conditions. The one (1) year storm must not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a one (1) year, twenty-four (24)
hour storm in pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, twenty-four (24) hour storm shall have peak
runoff discharge rates no greater than the ten (10) year, twenty-four (24) hour
storm under pre- development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the City of Youngstown Public Works Department,
the total volume (acre-feet) of runoff from a one (1) year, twenty-four (24)
hour storm occurring on the development drainage area before and after
development. These calculations shall meet the following standards:
            1.   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            2.   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            3.   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and disconnected
impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            4.   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, and time
of concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            5.   Use the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States,
NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/
] for rainfall depth data for stormwater design.
            6.   Use the SCS Type II rainfall distribution for all design
events with a recurrence interval greater than one (1) year. Include lot
coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed condition.
            7.   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall reflect
the average type of land use over the past ten (10) years and not only the
current land use.
               i.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               ii.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall
use post-construction hydrologic soil groups from Rainwater and Land
Development unless the soil is amended using the soil profile restoration
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development. All undisturbed areas or
open space with amended soils shall be treated as "open space in good
condition."
            8.   Time of Concentration - Use velocity-based methods from (TR-55
NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel time
(Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel flow.
               i.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               ii.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for
shallow concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer
Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            9.   The volume reduction provided by runoff reduction SCMs may be
subtracted from the post-development stormwater volume. Volume reductions for
these SCMs may be demonstrated using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land
Development or a hydrologic model acceptable to the City of Youngstown Public
Works Department.
         B.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways except in instances of engineered permeable
pavement systems. From the volume determined in Section
950.09(D)(3)(a), determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff
is:                                               The Critical Storm will be:
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:
----                      10                      1 year
10                        20                      2 year
20                        50                      5 year
50                        100                     10 year
100                       250                     25 year
250                       500                     50 year
500                       ---                     100 year
 
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 2-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year storm.
The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency shall be
controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 2-year
frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development drainage
area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms shall be
controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 10-year
frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development drainage
area.
   (e)   Stormwater Management for Previously Developed Areas.
      (1)   SCMs on previously developed sites must meet the criteria in the
Construction General Permit.

   When the City of Youngstown determines that site constraints compromise the
intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used that result in an
improvement of water quality and a reduction of stormwater quantity. Such
alternatives shall meet the standards in the Construction General Permit and
shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity control that would be
achieved by the on-site controls required under this regulation. City of
Youngstown Public Works Department may require proof of Ohio EPA review and
approval for any alternative action proposed.

   951.04 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Compliance with the provisions of this regulation shall not relieve any
person from responsibility for damage to any person otherwise imposed by law.
The provisions of this regulation are promulgated to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the public and are not designed for the benefit of any
individual or for the benefit of any particular parcel of property.
(Ord. 22-345. Passed 9-21-22.)
   951.05 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this regulation conflicts with other provisions of law or
ordinance, the most restrictive provisions, as determined by the City of

(Ord. 22-345. Passed 9-21-22.)
   951.07 DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges. No person shall discharge, or cause
to be discharged, an illicit discharge into the MS4. The commencement, conduct,
or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited except as
described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water; discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated/desalinated swimming pool
discharges; street wash water with dry cleanup methods and no detergents; and
discharges or flows from firefighting activities (not planned exercises). These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Youngstown to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Youngstown as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Mahoning County
Board of Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in
accordance with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Mahoning
County Board of Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency issues an NPDES permitting mechanism for household sewage
treatment systems existing prior to January 1, 2007. These discharges are
exempt unless such discharges are deemed to be creating a public health
nuisance by the Mahoning County Board of Health. Discharges from new or
replacement off-lot household sewage treatment systems installed after January
1, 2007 are not exempt from the requirements of this regulation.
         In compliance with the City of Youngstown Storm Water Management
Program, discharges from all off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems must either be eliminated or have coverage under an appropriate NPDES
permit issued and approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. When
such permit coverage is available for systems existing prior to January 1,
2007, discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems
existing prior to January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the
requirements of this regulation.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illegal Connections. The construction, use,
maintenance, or continued existence of illegal connections to the MS4 is
prohibited.
      (1)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (2)   A person is considered to be in violation of this regulation if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 22-345. Passed 9-21-22.)
   951.08 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The City of Youngstown shall establish a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and
household sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water
outfalls to the MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential,
commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry
weather flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)   Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)   The City of Youngstown shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to this regulation as often as may be necessary to determine
compliance with this regulation.
      (2)   The City of Youngstown shall have the right to set up at facilities
subject to this regulation such devices as are necessary to conduct monitoring
and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge, as determined by the
City of Youngstown.
      (3)   The City of Youngstown shall have the right to require the facility
owner/operator to install monitoring equipment as necessary. This sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in safe and proper
operating condition by the facility owner/operator at the owner/operator's
expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality may be
calibrated by the City of Youngstown to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and reasonable
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed
by the facility's owner/operator at the written or oral request of the City of
Youngstown and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the facility owner/operator.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Youngstown access to a
facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City of Youngstown is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Youngstown
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this

24hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
          A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
          B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten (10) days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed.  If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the BMP must be implemented within ten (10) days
from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the planned
control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.

   1101.06 PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES; ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS AND PENALTIES.
   The following details the process that developers shall follow for the
successful implementation of their project.
   (a)   Application shall first be made in the Planning Department for a
zoning permit. This permit assures the developer and the City that the zoning
of the property in question is correct for the intended use.
   (b)   Project proposals shall then be submitted along with the zoning permit
to the Deputy Director of Planning for Design Review. Submittal requirements
include the plat, elevation drawings, site plans and preliminary building plans
and specifications. These plans shall be prepared by a licensed architect or
engineer.
   (c)   The Design Review Committee shall review the plans, at the earliest
scheduled meeting, for conformance with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1102. The Committee may approve the proposal as submitted or before approval
may require the applicant to modify, alter or adjust the proposal to bring it
into conformance. In cases where such changes are required, the developer shall
be required to resubmit the documents with the necessary revisions to the
Committee within two weeks. Any revised plans shall be reviewed by the
Committee for design conformance. The zoning permit shall then be issued,
indicating the design review process has been completed and approval has been
obtained. This approval is necessary before any building permit may be issued.
      In cases where a conflict arises between the developer and the Design
Review Committee and an agreement cannot be reached, the case shall be referred
to the City Planning Commission/Board of Zoning Appeals for consideration at
their earliest scheduled meeting.
   (d)   Once Design Review Committee approval has been obtained, the developer
shall apply for the necessary building permits from the Building Inspection
Department. Plan review shall take place by the appropriate departments,
including Engineering, Health, Water and Fire.
   (e)   The enforcing officer has the responsibility of making periodic checks
on all construction as part of the inspections process, to insure conformity of
construction with the approved design plans.
   (f)   Once all necessary inspections have been completed (design conformance
as well as general construction, electric, plumbing, heating, air-conditioning
and ventilation) an occupancy permit shall be issued. Should construction
deviate from the approved plans as determined by the enforcing officer, the
occupancy permit shall be withheld until the appropriate changes are made.
   (g)   Landscaping of the site shall be completed within one planting season
(spring, fall) of the completion of the exterior of the building.
      (1)   The developer shall establish an escrow account in an amount
equivalent to the cost of landscape materials and labor.
      (2)   The developer shall name the City as the escrow agent.
      (3)   The City and developer shall enter into the escrow agreement prior
to the issuance of the necessary building permits.
      Should the landscaping not be completed within the allotted time, this
account shall then be used to contract out the necessary landscape services.
   (h)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter or Chapter
1102 shall be punished for each offense according to the law. Each day such
violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense. The minimum fine for
such an offense shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). (Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-

CHAPTER 1102
Standards for Development
1102.01   Introduction.
1102.02   General provisions.
1102.03   Building review; site review.
1102.04   Parking.
1102.05   Signage.
1102.06   Residential development in B-1 Central Business District.
1102.07   Streetscape program.
   1102.01 INTRODUCTION.
   These standards for development have been designed to aid the developer in
designing a pleasing environment supportive of the goals and objectives of the
Central Area of Youngstown.
   These goals and objectives are as follows:
   (a)   To promote a high level of architectural character and integrity in
the Central Area.
   (b)   To encourage the preservation of the existing urban character, and to
enrich the physical form of the Central Area.
   (c)   To require that development be consistent with an established set of
comprehensive standards which will encourage a better quality living
environment.
   (d)   To recognize the importance of protecting existing culturally and
architecturally significant structures in the Central Area and to enhance,
preserve and protect such structures by encouraging the successful integration
of new proposals with these resources.
   (e)   To facilitate economic stability and growth in the Central Area.
   The planning staff, together with the Design Review Committee, shall concern
themselves with the review of all proposed development projects within the
Central Area. Proposals under Committee jurisdiction shall include all new
construction projects as well as exterior remodeling work, demolition and/or
building additions planned for existing structures.
(Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   It is not the intent of Chapters
1101 and
1102 to discourage or restrict the imagination, innovation or variety of design
schemes for downtown development but rather to encourage the designer to focus
on proposing creative high quality designs which will enhance the downtown
environment.
   Chapter
1102 is subject to amendment upon the recommendation of the City Planning
Commission and with the majority vote of Council.
   These rules shall be supplementary to the rules set forth in the Zoning
Ordinance.
(Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.03 BUILDING REVIEW; SITE REVIEW.
   All proposed construction in the Central Area, except for districts zoned I-
L Industrial-Limited and I-H Industrial-Unlimited shall be reviewed with
respect to architectural character and design, facade treatment, roofscape
design, scale, geometry and height. Because of the special nature of industrial
projects, those proposed for I-L and I-H Industrial Districts shall be reviewed
on an individual basis, so that particular development needs can be taken into
consideration. Residential development which is proposed for the B-1 Central
Business District shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section
1102.06 as well as the general provisions of this chapter.
   (a)   Architectural Character and Design. Consideration shall be given to
the compatibility of a newly proposed project's architectural character, design
and facade treatment with other sound structures in good condition that exist
in the immediate project area.
      Within the B-1 Central Business District, encouraging the renovation of
existing structures to create a unifying historic theme shall be a priority for
the Design Review Committee, particularly along West Federal Street between
Market Street and Belmont Avenue, and along the intersecting streets of Phelps,
Hazel and Chestnut.
      Renovation and restoration to a structure's original form and character
shall be encouraged where possible to highlight the individuality and
distinctive architectural qualities of various buildings in the area.
      If a historic storefront or facade is present underneath more recent
alterations, developers are encouraged to remove such alterations to expose the
storefronts and to create continuity of personal scale in relation to the
sidewalks and street furniture. In some instances, renovation of the building
may not be feasible, particularly where the original character of the building
has been lost through extensive alteration or the original building had little
or no distinguishing features.
      Where plans for alterations and additions to existing property are not
historic in design, they shall be reviewed for compatibility with the character
of adjacent property, neighborhood or environment.
      Vacant upper stories of all existing structures should be promoted for
apartment, business or office use. To prevent appearance of vacant buildings,
windows shall be lined with black plastic sheeting or some other material as
approved by the Design Review Committee.
      It is encouraged that wall clutter, including projecting air conditioning
units, overhead electric service units, sign support remnants and the like, on
all existing vacant or occupied structures be reduced or eliminated where
possible.
      (1)   Facade treatment. The use of materials which bring interesting
substance and texture to the overall project appearance is encouraged.
Suggested materials include masonry, such as split faced or decorative block
and glazed ceramic tile finishes, wood, plaster, stucco, stone, brick, marble
and terra cotta. The innovative, creative or exceptional uses of other
materials shall be considered by the Design Review Committee. Aluminum or metal
facades are strongly discouraged. To preserve area property values, solid walls
or facades lacking in design features are discouraged. New or infill materials
should correspond, be complementary in contrast or be neutral to adjacent
structures.
         When the facade of an existing building is being restored in the
Central Business District, the following standards shall apply:
         A.   In the event that a building is eligible to the National Register
of Historic Places and Federal money is involved restoration or renovation
shall follow the Secretary of the Interior's standards for historic
preservation.
         B.   When an existing structure's original facade is architecturally
or historically significant, it should be restored as such; when full
restoration is not possible, necessary alterations should be compatible with
the original period of the structure.
         C.   Original storefronts should be preserved and repaired with little
or no alteration to the architectural or historic integrity of the building as
a whole; false facades or other attempts at modernization should be removed. A
compatible relationship should be maintained between the groundfloor treatment
and overall design of the building.
         D.   When visible from the right of way, side and rear walls should be
architecturally compatible with the main elevation and shall be considered in
the architectural restoration.
         E.   The use of canvas awnings is encouraged to provide shelter,
reduce glare and conserve energy. Awning design and placement should complement
the architectural character of the building.
         F.   The use of impenetrable glass in storefronts should be considered
to eliminate the need for security gates and grates, and to alleviate security
concerns. The use of exposed roll-down doors or grills is discouraged.
         G.   The character of a building is emphasized by the shape, size and
placement of its windows and their decorative trim. Because of their
architectural importance, therefore, the alteration or elimination of existing
windows is strongly discouraged. Windows shall be provided/restored at street
level wherever possible.
         H.   The use of interior blinds, insulating curtains or glass internal
shutters and other decorative devices should be considered as an alternative to
storefront alteration or elimination, particularly where energy conservation is
of concern.
         I.   Window air conditioning units, nonfunctioning power lines,
structures and signage which cover or mar the architectural features of a
building should be removed.
         J.   The style, size, proportion and placement of signage should be
designed in keeping with the architectural and historical significance of the
building. Signage is generally intended for the pedestrian at ground level and
should be designed accordingly.
         K.   External alterations which attempt to initiate the design of
historic periods other than the original are inappropriate It is preferable to
use materials which are true to the original period of construction. Materials
including vinyl, aluminum siding, anodized aluminum, mirrored and tinted glass,
artificial stone or brick veneer are inappropriate for historic restoration, as
are the use of mansard overhangs, wood shakes, nonfunctioning shutters and the
like.
      (2)   Application of color. The application of color, whether alone or in
combination with others, shall be reviewed with respect to the existing
character of adjacent buildings in the surrounding area. Neutrals, earthtones
and natural materials in subdued shades are encouraged. Bold, vibrant colors or
color schemes, including fluorescents and neons, may not add to the quality of
a project and shall be subject to stringent review.
         The overall color scheme of external walls and structural elements,
including windows, doors and trim, shall be reviewed. Architectural treatment
of building fronts shall be compatible with materials used on the sides and
rear. Where storefronts or other ground level uses are proposed, treatment of
ground floor facades shall complement the treatment of the upper levels.
      (3)   Roofscape design. Where a roof will be visible from the street
level of adjacent properties and/or public rights of way, the roof covering
materials shall be subject to review. Such materials should be compatible in
color, texture and design with adjacent properties.
         For commercial projects in the immediate downtown business district,
suggested roof materials include slate, copper, terra cotta tiles and solar
panels. In addition, asphalt and wood shingles are also suggested for
residential areas. On all but flat roofs, roll roofing (felt paper), aluminized
flat roofing materials, aluminized roofing paints or treatments or
architectural roofing panels commonly used on pre-engineered metal buildings
are strongly discouraged.
         HVAC and other mechanical equipment, elevator shafts, and satellite
dishes located on the roof shall be as inconspicuous as possible when viewed
from adjacent properties or public rights of way at the street level vantage
point. One means of accomplishing this would be to paint the equipment black.
The equipment's appearance shall be well maintained.
      (4)   Scale, geometry, and height. The scale and geometry of a proposed
building shall come under the review of the Design Review Committee to insure
that it does not infringe upon the light and ventilation rights of adjacent
structures. In addition, the aim of this review is to prevent a structure whose
dimensions are uncharacteristic of the surrounding area. Placement and scale of
window and door openings will be included in this review. New development
should promote ground level pedestrian activity incorporating storefronts, open
or internal arcades, and other public open spaces (such as malls, plazas,
gardens) where applicable. Mallways which shorten the length of pedestrian
walking distances between the blocks are also encouraged.
         Maximum height requirements for all new structures are regulated
through the Zoning Ordinance, Article VI, Area, Yard and Height Requirements.
         The following are the suggested minimum height requirements for all
new construction within the Central Area.
 
R-1.0 General Residential      2 stories, or 20 feet
R-1.5 Multi-Family Residential 2 stories, or 20 feet
I     Institutional            2 stories, or 20 feet
B-1   Central Business         2 stories, or 20 feet
B-3   Community Business       1 story, or 15 feet
I-L   Limited-Industrial       1 story, or 15 feet
I-H   Unlimited-Industrial     1 story, or 15 feet
      (5)   Demolition. The proposed demolition of any building or structure
within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Design Review District shall be
subject to review by the Design Review Committee. Nothing in this section shall
be interpreted to supersede Ohio Basic Building Code Sections 4101:2-1-39 and
4101:2-1-40. In reviewing demolition proposals, consideration shall be given to
the following factors: potential historic significance of the building or
structure to be demolished, effect of demolition on surrounding property,
structural integrity of the building or structure in question, proposal re-use
of the property in question, and the extent to which alternatives to demolition
have been explored.
         Where demolition is requested by the applicant, the applicant must
demonstrate that no adverse impact will result or that all reasonable
alternatives to demolition have been explored and are not practical or
feasible. The Design Review Committee may request the applicant to produce
within a specified time frame, any of the following information to assist in
determining whether demolition is justified:
         A.   A written report from an independent licensed professional
engineer who practices as a structural engineer or architect with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of the structures on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation.
         B.   Testimony from the project's architect, or project developer, or
project appraiser experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility
of rehabilitation or re-use of the existing structure on the property. Written
documentation shall be filed as official evidence of testimony.
         C.   Cost estimates and cash flow analysis of the various alternative
uses of the property that have been explored, including demolition. Written
documentation shall be filed as official evidence of testimony.
         D.   Testimony and relevant documents regarding any real estate broker
or firm engaged to sell or lease the property; reasonableness of the price or
rent sought by the applicant; any advertisements placed for the sale or rent of
the property.
         E.   Economic incentives and/or funding available to the applicant
through federal, state, City or private programs.
         F.   Other information considered relevant by the Design Review
Committee.
            Any failure to comply with, or produce, information requested by
the Design Review Committee shall constitute a violation of this section.
Review will be suspended until such time as the applicant produces the
requested information or complies with this section. Nonresponsiveness by the
applicant of any Committee request which remains unanswered for more than sixty
days will constitute a voluntary withdrawal of the request for a review by the
Design Review Committee.
            Any demolition activity that occurs within the jurisdictional
boundaries of the Design Review District without prior approval of the Design
Review Committee is a violation of this section and shall be subject to
punishment as prescribed by law.
            Where demolition is required and permitted, the subsequent use of
the affected property shall conform to the standards listed in this chapter.
Special attention shall be paid to subsection (g) hereof. Where abutting walls
are damaged as a result of demolition, they shall be repaired in a manner which
is consistent with the immediate environment, and which effects the least
change in the original character of the remaining structure.
            (Ord. 97-217. Passed 9-24-97.)
   (b)   Plant Materials. Provisions shall be made by the developer for the
continued maintenance of all trees, shrubs, flowerbeds, grass, groundcover and
other plant materials used in landscaping. Dead or dying plant materials shall
be removed and replaced as necessary. Plastic or other artificial plant
materials are not considered as appropriate landscaping materials and the
Design Review Committee does not look favorably upon their use. When plant
materials are used for screening purposes, evergreen or similar plant varieties
should be used and should be large enough at planting to be immediately
effective.
      Note: The developer may wish to give careful consideration to the
placement of all plant materials with respect to existing or proposed steam
lines.
      (1)   Trees. Trees should be in scale with their surroundings and planted
so as not to impede pedestrian traffic flow. The character of the trees
(whether rounded, spreading, weeping, upright) shall be appropriate for their
location and use.
         When grouped, trees should be compatible in appearance with adequate
spacing allocated for proper growth. Strongly colored trees are best planted
separately. Flowering varieties can be grouped for an attractive seasonal
effect.
         Street trees are those medium to large-size trees which are planted in
paved areas, generally along the right of way. To permit pedestrian passage,
they shall have a clear trunk of seven feet. Street trees shall not be placed
in planters or similar containers but rather directly in the pavement, with
openings large enough to allow proper aeration and to permit water to reach the
root system. Spacing requirements range from thirty-five to fifty feet. The
minimum diameter of street trees shall be two and one-half inches at planting.
         Ornamental trees are those trees generally trained as small shrubs and
used in background planting. The ornamental qualities of these trees (branching
structure, seasonal interest, flower or fruit color) should be given careful
consideration when planning tree placement. They may be placed in planters,
providing there is adequate room for growth and development. Placement of
planters shall be out of the main pedestrian right of way.
      (2)   Shrubs. The primary consideration in selecting shrubs should be
their natural growth height and suitability to pruning. Shrubs can be used as
free-standing plants, or can be planted in groups to create hedges and screens.
These hedges can be used for camouflaging objectionable views or for adding
contrast and seasonal interest to the landscape. Shrubs and hedges should be
prevented from growing into or otherwise restricting pedestrian traffic flow.
      (3)   Ground cover. Plants used for ground cover can be used under taller
shrubs or as low-growing carpet. The varieties used should be selected for
their toughness and ability to recover from pedestrian damage. They should not
be so coarse in texture or tangled in growth habit as to make litter removal
difficult. Embankment plantings shall be extremely hardy, have spreading growth
habit and should be tolerant of drought conditions.
      (4)   Grass. Grass should be used only in passive areas and should be
able to withstand casual walking or sitting. To prevent worn paths or shortcuts
from developing through a lawn, grassed areas can be built up or contoured into
a berm or other land form. Alternately, enclosures around the grassed area can
be created by using walls, fencing and shrubs to prevent such short cuts. Small
spaces between buildings, areas under trees with dense foliage and shaded
spaces should not be covered with grass, since dampness and the lack of
sunlight and rainfall may be detrimental to grass development.
      (5)   Mulch. Mulching materials, including wood chips, bark, peat moss or
other natural materials, may be used in plant beds, planters or other suitable
areas, but shall be maintained and periodically replaced with fresh materials.
To prevent possible hazards, pedestrian ways shall remain free from such
materials.
   (c)   Paving Materials. All paving surfaces, including but not limited to
entranceways, sidewalks, public open spaces and service areas shall be of
permanent hard surfaces with adequate grading and drainage. Dirt and slag
surfacing is not permitted. Paving shall be coordinated with the street
furniture, planters, fencing and lighting elements, where applicable as well as
with the proposed structure. The following paving materials are suggested for
use alone or in some combination to introduce patterns, textures and colors
into paving treatments and to create continuity and consistency among the
streets of downtown.
      (1)   Concrete. A variety of textures, such as broom finishes, and
geometric patterns stamped or scored to resemble brick, stone or tile can be
introduced with the use of concrete.
         The use of color in pavement treatments is permitted if it has been
carefully chosen to blend with the proposed building and site. Stone aggregates
are available in a variety of colors, and precast concrete slabs also come in a
variety of textures, colors and finishes.
      (2)   Stone. Slate, granite, quartzite, sandstone, marble and bluestone
are all permitted paving materials. Stone cobbles, although attractive, are
strongly discouraged in active pedestrian concourses. Loose stones of gravel
are not permitted for paving pedestrian ways.
      (3)   Brick. Brick may be used for the entire paved surface or as a
contrasting trim to concrete. The texture, color, size and durability should be
taken into consideration for the intended use. Earthtones or a carefully
selected range of colors are encouraged. Brick paving should be bonded to a
concrete underlay with mortared installation or laid in a granular bed with
sufficient drainage.
   (d)   Screens and Fences. The following materials are permitted for fencing:
brick, masonry, stone, wood, wrought iron and evergreen hedging. Height and
locational requirements can be found in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Street Furniture. The Design Review Committee shall review the use of
street furniture as it relates to its environment. This review includes, but is
not limited to benches and other seating arrangements, sculpture and other art
pieces, planters, wastepaper containers, fountains, telephone booths, play
equipment, tree grates, lighting posts/standards, kiosks and information
booths. The location of street furniture in public open spaces is encouraged,
but shall be placed out of direct pedestrian circulation paths.
      The use of natural materials such as wood, brick, stone or living plant
materials to introduce texture and interest to this element of the landscape is
encouraged. The Design Review Committee discourages the use of plastic
materials. Recycled oil barrels or similar means of collecting trash are also
strongly discouraged.
      Outdoor furniture and equipment should be appropriate for the climatic
conditions of the area, and for the degree of use they are expected to receive.
Factors including extent of wear and tear, vandalism or other abuse should be
taken into consideration when designing and choosing street furniture.
   (f)   Lighting. The design, scale and placement of lighting fixtures should
relate to the overall site image. Materials that are complementary to existing
or proposed street furnishings should be used. Light fixtures should also be
compatible with the proposed building. Suggested materials for lampposts are
wood, cast iron, steel, aluminum and concrete or other materials as approved by
the Design Review Committee.
      Careful consideration shall be given to the height and spacing of all
lighting equipment. As a safety consideration, adequate illumination shall be
maintained in all areas being served. Street lights are typically mounted at
the height of thirty feet, with lower mounts used on streets of aesthetic or
historic importance. In pedestrian ways requiring lighting, primary fixtures
are mounted at the height of ten to fifteen feet. Lower level supplemental
lighting or additional overheads should be used in potentially hazardous areas
where grade changes or steps are located, for example.
      Lighting equipment, when at ground level or low-mounted, shall not be an
obstruction to the pedestrian, and shall be designed to avoid accidental
disturbance, vandalism and electric shock if damaged.
      In no case shall lighting create a glare or become a nuisance to adjacent
property owner, particularly in residential areas. Additional requirements for
parking lot lighting can be found in the Zoning Ordinance, Section 77.
      (1)   Decorative or accent lighting. Consideration should be given to
illuminating particularly attractive, unusual or historically significant
buildings, monuments or other features located on site with floodlights during
evening hours to accent special features or qualities.
         Tree, landscaping or flower beds are often lighted with units set
directly in the beds and screened. Fountains and pools which are part of
landscaping schemes can be illuminated through the use of submerged floodlights
or similar equipment.
      (2)   Parking lot lighting. When commercial or private parking lots are
operational during evening hours they shall be well lighted for pedestrian
safety and protection from vandalism.
         The internal parking area shall be lighted with omni-directional
floodlighting equipment, located along principle parking aisles. Entrances
shall be well lighted and clearly marked. Accent lighting, when incorporated
into the landscape strip around the lot perimeter, shall not be an obstacle to
the pedestrian.
   (g)   Allocation and Treatment of Open Space and Yards.
      (1)   General. Yards and open space should employ attractive paving
materials, planting and landscaping, the use of street furniture where
applicable, adequate lighting, screening or other elements to define the space
and to relate such areas to adjoining buildings and street frontage.
         Yards and open space on the site may be developed at the normal grade
level, terraced or recessed to not more than four feet below ground level.
Plans for open spaces incorporating sculpture, art work, murals, fountains,
pools or similar water features, or other pieces of architectural significance
shall be reviewed and approval is required by the Design Review Committee.
      (2)   Yard and height requirements. Area, yard and height requirements
are set forth in the Zoning Ordinance, Article VI. Additional requirements are
listed below.
         In the B-1 Central Business District there are no setback requirements
and construction may take place to the property lines. However, when any
building is being proposed to a property line which abuts a public right of
way, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of the paved
sidewalk, sidewalk area, driveways and grass strips abutting such land. The
developer is also encouraged to participate in the streetscape program as
described in Section
1102.07.
         Front yard setbacks should be in line with those of adjacent sites to
promote the continuity of street frontage and to facilitate pedestrian
movement.
         Along West Federal Street between Market Street and Belmont Avenue,
and along the intersecting streets of Phelps, Hazel and Chestnut, no front
setback is permitted for the first or second story of any new development or
restoration. The minimum height of said new development or restoration is two
stories.
          Front yards shall be kept free of parking, waste disposal facilities,
service or loading docks and other similar activities.
         When parking is present in the rear yard, it shall be effectively
screened from public view by planting a four foot minimum width landscape strip
around the perimeter of the rear yard. This landscape strip should be continued
along the side yards towards the front of the property where possible. This
strip prevents car bumper overhang along the public right of way, reducing
possible vehicular-pedestrian conflicts.
         All yards shall be landscaped in a manner compatible with the
immediate surroundings. Where appropriate, paving materials and planters are
encouraged as substitute for, or complement to, grass or other ground cover.
Paving shall be of a permanent, hard surface and decorative in design. Clay,
sand, gravel, dirt or other temporary paving treatments are prohibited. When
planting landscaping materials, vision clearance shall be maintained at all
intersections, regardless of zoning district.
         Where fencing is employed on or around the perimeter of a site, wood,
brick, stone, masonry, wrought iron or evergreen hedging is permitted. When
chain link fencing is proposed, consideration should be given to painting it
black and accompanying it with evergreen or other plantings to soften its
appearance. Planters, hedging, earthforms, berms or similar treatments used for
screening or fencing are also permitted.
      (3)   Landscaping of building entrances. All building entrances shall be
developed to make them attractive and convenient to the user. Ornamental trees,
shrubs and other planting materials are encouraged, whether in planters or at
the ground level near these entrances. These planting requirements may not
apply in areas where extensively planted plazas have already been established.
Proper signage is required for all public entrances, and when these entrances
are to be operational during the evening hours, lighting shall also be
provided.
      (4)   Pedestrian and vehicular circulation. Site and building design
shall accommodate pedestrian circulation from parking structures or lots and
from other buildings on the site. Pedestrian and automobile circulation shall
be separated as much as possible throughout the site, with pedestrian paths
designated through the use of different paving treatments.
         The use of special passenger drop-off plazas, turn-arounds, motor
courts and the like immediately adjacent to the building are encouraged where
appropriate. Where two or more structures are in close proximity these plazas
may be shared or common.
      (5)   Servicing, utilities and waste disposal. Servicing, loading and
delivery shall be oriented towards the rear or side yard of the site whenever
possible. These activities shall be located off-street and should be
internalized where possible. View of the service area from public roadways,
primary entry drives or drop-off plazas, courts, parking and pedestrian areas
shall be screened. Paving of such service areas shall be of a permanent hard
surface material and well drained.
         A.   Utilities. Where possible, underground placement of utility and
communication lines is encouraged to reduce visual clutter. When it is
necessary to place equipment above ground, it shall be screened from view and
landscaped.
         B.   Waste Disposal. Outside dumpster areas shall be located in the
rear yard where possible, enclosed and screened from public view. This area
shall be paved with permanent hard surfacing and shall be accessible to
vehicular servicing. The dumpster screen shall be constructed of material that
is the same as or compatible with the primary building materials. The Design
Review Committee recommends landscaping the area around these screens. In no
instance shall dumpsters be permitted in the front yards of any site. (Ord. 94-
528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.04 PARKING.
   (a)   General. All proposals, whether to create new parking facilities or to
modify existing parking lots or structures, shall be submitted to the Design
Review Committee for approval.
   Each parking structure and/or lot should be designed with respect to the
size of the property, surrounding street pattern, adjacent properties, nature
of local soils and climate, and the number of cars to be accommodated. Where on
site parking is required, the parking area may be internalized either within
the proposed building or in attached or detached parking garages. Surface
parking is permitted, but shall be oriented to the side or rear yard areas. The
required number of parking spaces shall be supplied as inconspicuously and
conveniently as possible in an attractive setting.
   (b)   Parking Garages. Proposed parking garages, whether for private or
commercial use, shall come under the review of the Design Review Committee.
Architectural character, design and treatment of a garage structure shall be
compatible with or complementary to the principle building on the site or the
adjacent structures it will be serving. The exterior elevations of parking
structures should be designed to minimize the use of blank concrete facades. In
the parking garage, no part of a parked car below the hoodline should be
visible from the ground level of any part of the site, adjacent sites or public
right of way.
   The minimum setback for a parking structure shall be the same that is
required for a principle structure. Points of ingress and egress shall be
clearly marked and shall be no closer than twenty-five feet to an intersection
or other curb cut.
   The use of planters, trellises and vegetation is encouraged for screening
and decorative purposes. The Design Review Committee recommends planting a
landscape strip with a minimum of four feet in width around the perimeter of
the garage, consisting of some combination of evergreen trees, shrubs, vines,
flowers, ground cover and lawn. When a garage is open during the evening hours,
it shall be well lit both internally and externally.
   (c)   Surface Parking Lots. All parking proposals, whether for private or
commercial use, can be found in the Zoning Ordinance, Section 77. Additional
requirements are listed below.
      (1)   Location. In the B-1 Central Business District, private surface
parking lots shall be oriented to the rear and/or side yard of the building
being served.
         For residential development, all required parking shall be provided
for on the same lot occupied by the main building, with internalized parking
preferred. For other uses, more than fifty percent (50%) of the required
parking shall be provided for on the same lot with the balance provided on
private property within 400 feet of the main use.
      (2)   Access. Curb cuts for access drives connecting commercial or
private surface parking lots to the right of way shall be no closer than
twenty-five feet to an intersection or other curb cut. Parking shall not be
permitted in these drives. To prevent excessive vehicular traffic flow
interruptions and to reduce vehicular-pedestrian conflict, no more than two
access drives into any one lot shall be permitted. New curb cuts will not be
permitted on West Federal Street between Market Street and Belmont Avenue.
      (3)   Peripheral lot treatment. All sides of a commercial or private
parking lot abutting a public right of way (including streets, sidewalks and
public open spaces) shall be treated as follows:
         A landscape strip at least four feet in width shall be provided around
the periphery of the parking lot. It is strongly recommended that this easement
be planted with some combination of trees, shrubs, flowers, grass and ground
cover. Decorative paving may also be used in combination with the above
materials.
         A fence or screen shall be provided along the inside of the landscape
strip, and shall be not less than four feet, nor greater than six feet in
height. This fence shall serve to prevent car bumper overhang onto any abutting
public right of way. Convenient breaks along fences or screens shall be
provided to allow for surveillance, security and pedestrian access.
         Materials for the screen shall be permanent in nature with wood,
masonry, brick, stone, wrought iron, compact evergreen hedging or some
combination thereof permitted. It is suggested that if chain link fencing must
be used, it shall be painted black and accompanied by evergreen or other
plantings to soften its appearance. Railroad ties are strongly discouraged.
         The screen can be built in the form of a planter, earthform or berm,
taking all or part of the width of the landscape strip. The combined height of
such screening methods and their plantings shall not be less than four feet.
Fences, planters, earthforms or berms may be used individually or in some
combination.
         All parking lots, regardless of perimeter treatment, shall have
pedestrian access to the public right of way and to all buildings served.
         Where the parking lot abuts private property, including open lots,
buildings, private drives or aisles, the landscape strip requirements shall be
the same.
      (4)   Internal lot treatment, public and private parking lots.
         A.   Configuration. While the configuration of the parking lot is left
to the designer, each stall shall be a minimum of nine feet by nineteen feet,
exclusive of drive aisles and turning bays. Where traffic is one-way, access
aisles shall be a minimum of twelve feet in width; where traffic is two-way,
access aisles shall be a minimum of twenty-four feet in width.
         B.   Paving. Paving shall be of a permanent hard surface, with
standing concrete or better quality curbs and gutters. Paving materials should
approximate those in the landscape guidelines and incorporate decorative
elements. Such paving shall be properly graded and drained to dispose of all
surface water, with grading and drainage plans approved by the Commissioner of
Engineering.
         C.   Landscaping. The landscaping requirements listed below are
exclusive of requirements for peripheral lot treatment.
            The Design Review Committee looks favorably upon the development
plans which incorporate the use of planting islands for the internal portion of
large parking lots, both private and public, which accommodate more than 100
cars. These islands should be placed either at the end of each row of car
stalls or within the row, with a minimum of one island per twenty-five car
stalls. End islands should be a minimum of five feet by fifteen feet for a
single row of cars, with one shade tree planted or five feet by thirty feet for
double rows, with two shade trees planted.
            Where islands are within the row of cars, they should be a minimum
of five feet by five feet. Tree guards, grates, bollards, curbing or wheelstops
should be used to protect trees from car damage. End islands may also
incorporate some combination of shrubs, flowers, ground covers, mulch or
paving.
            Sidewalks placed between rows of parked cars shall be paved and
shall be wide enough to accommodate bumper overhang. Decorative parking and
landscaping should be incorporated into these pedestrian ways. In all cases,
the line of vision clearance for vehicles traveling through the lot shall be
maintained.
            When more than one private parking lot is proposed on the same site
and they are to be adjacent to each other, they shall be separated by a
landscaped buffer four feet minimum in width.
      (5)   Additional requirements for commercial lots. Attendant booths or
kiosks shall be permanent in nature. Materials used in construction shall
approximate those prescribed for new construction, Section
1102.03(a)(1).
         Such structures shall be placed on concrete islands. Commercial
parking lots shall not be within 100 feet of each other along the same side of
a public right of way. It is suggested that there be only one sign per lot
entrance, no larger than six square feet, with the name of the business, the
word "parking" or simply the letter "P" encircled. In addition, there shall be
one sign per kiosk or booth indicating the parking rates and hours of
operation. (Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.05 SIGNAGE.
   The review of signage proposed for development projects shall address size,
scale, geometry, location on building or site, materials, colors, detail,
legibility, illumination, movement and wall or ground anchorage details.
   (a)   General Guidelines. These requirements are supplementary to the City's
signage regulations. Private signs shall be designed with reasonable
proportions and in keeping with the area and its buildings. Signs which combine
inventiveness, excellence in lettering, coordination with the buildings colors
and materials, legibility, creative lighting and effective use of logos or
decorative devices are desired.
      Signage is generally intended for the pedestrian at ground level and
should be designed with this in mind.
      The visual impact of any illumination during evening hours shall be taken
into consideration by the Design Review Committee. Illuminations shall not be
by harsh, colored lights and shall not flash or pulsate.
      Signage shall not employ moving parts, or emit noise, smoke or other
foreign substances so as not to distract motorists or cause a safety hazard.
      It is recommended that signage be limited to two per building. Letter
height on signage should not exceed twenty-four inches.
      Signage for multiple tenant buildings shall be reviewed by the Design
Review Committee on a case-by-case basis. One consolidated sign identifying all
building tenants is recommended.
   (b)   Permitted Signage. The following is a summary list of permitted signs:
Walls signs, including directories, plaques and signs for building or business
identification
      Ground signs, including dedication and memorial monuments and monuments
for building or business identification
      Signage painted on windows
      Canopies and awnings
      Marquee signs (theaters, hotels, motels, inns only)
      Parking lot or parking garage signs
      Temporary signs (by permit only)
      (1)   Wall signs. Wall signs are those signs which are attached flat
against the wall of any building or structure. They shall be architecturally
integrated with the building upon which they are displayed. No sign shall
project more than twelve inches from the wall of the building or structure. The
bottom edge of a wall sign shall not be less than eight feet above the
sidewalk, except for those signs which do not project over three inches beyond
the face of the building over public property. Wall signs shall not cover the
ornamental features of a building. Wall signs should relate to the cornice line
of the buildings and should reinforce the pedestrian scale.
         One sign is permitted per street front. All copy shall be clear,
legible and in good contrast to sign background material. Illumination of
signage shall not produce a glare. Signs painted directly on the wall of a
building are included in this category.
      (2)   Ground signs. A ground sign is any detached sign supported by
uprights, braces or a foundation. They stand independent of a building or
structure. Billboards are not included in this category.
         Ground signs and monuments shall be architecturally compatible with
the building to which they are related. One ground sign is permitted per street
frontage. Signage constructed as part of a landscape area shall be compatible
with those landscape elements.
         Placement of all ground signs or monuments shall be reviewed by the
Design Review Committee. No sign shall be placed in front of the building
setback requirements. Clear sight shall be maintained at all times along a
public right of way for vehicular as well as pedestrian safety. All ground
signs shall have a side yard clearance of at least five feet from buildings and
lot lines.
         No ground sign shall at any given point be more than twenty-two feet
nor less than two feet above grade line, and shall be properly supported and
braced.
         Copy shall be clear, legible and in good contrast to background
material. Illumination is permitted, either internally or by concealed
floodlight. The base of monuments may be landscaped with combination of low
growing bushes, plants or flowers.
      (3)   Window signs. Window signs are those signs in which all lettering,
logos and illustrations are painted directly on the glass surface of windows,
doors, or storefront bays. It is recommended that such signs not exceed thirty
percent (30%) of the total glass area of the window.
         Lettering of all window signs shall be clear, using colors which are
compatible with the building facade or storefront. One window sign per street
front is permitted to create a more uniform street front.
      (4)   Canopies and awnings. Canopies and awnings shall be architecturally
integrated with the character of the building to which they are attached. A
minimum clear space of seven feet under canopies or awnings shall be required
for safe pedestrian passage.
      (5)   Marquee signs. Marquee signs shall be constructed entirely of metal
or noncombustible materials and may be attached to or hung from a marquee. When
hung from a marquee, at its lowest level the signs shall be at least nine feet
above sidewalk or ground level.
         Signs shall not extend outside the line of the marquee. Signs may be
attached to the sides and front of a marquee and such signs may extend the
entire length and width of such marquee, provided the sign does not exceed more
than six feet above nor one foot below such marquee, but under no circumstances
shall any sign have vertical dimensions greater than six feet.
      (6)   Parking lot and garage signs. Signs which identify parking lots or
garages, whether commercial or private, shall not exceed six square feet in
area. One sign per entrance is permitted to maintain proper sight clearance.
         One additional sign is permitted per kiosk or attendant booth with
copy limited to identifying the parking rates and hours of operation. This sign
shall not exceed four square feet.
      (7)   Temporary signage. Temporary signage, relating to advertisement,
construction of announcement, real estate, banners, flags or pennants shall be
permitted pursuant to Section 2307 of the existing City signage regulations. In
addition, all banners, flags or pennants, whether suspended from marquees,
canopies, awnings, utility poles or similar means, shall not be hung lower than
eight feet above the sidewalk or ground level to allow for safe pedestrian
passage. The placement of such temporary signage shall first be approved by the
Design Review Committee before any permits are issued.
   (c)   Prohibited Signage. The following signs are prohibited:
      (1)   Portable or trailer signs, including those with changeable copy,
shall not be on permanent display.
      (2)   Free-standing signage, other than those noted, including pole signs
and sandwich boards.
      (3)   Signs which are hung in such a manner so as to swing or move
freely.
      (4)   Signs projecting into a right of way so as to cause possible
vehicular or pedestrian hazard.
      (5)   Temporary signs, other than those noted.
      (6)   No sign painted or printed on paper muslin or other fabric shall be
extended over public property or posted, tacked or otherwise secured on any
exterior surfaces of buildings or other surfaces of other fixed objects except
as provided under temporary signage.
      (7)   No sign shall be erected or placed over the face of an existing
sign. No additional sign or advertising device shall be attached to or
suspended from any sign.
   (d)   Exempt Signage. Signage which is exempt from the requirements set
forth in this section includes the following:
      (1)   Institutional signage. Institutional signage includes those signs
for public, charitable or religious institutions.
      (2)   Integral signs. Decorative or architectural features built into the
walls of buildings as an integral part of their design including memorial
plaques or tablets, cornerstones, historic tablets and the like consisting of
bronze, brass, glass, marble, stone, aluminum, stainless steel or other similar
materials.
      (3)   Municipal signs. Signs required by law to be maintained or posted
through governmental order, rule or regulation. This includes directional and
traffic signs, legal notices, railroad and danger signs, public safety and
convenience signs (such as those indicating public transit service, public
utilities, pedestrian convenience information), flags or other government
insignia. (Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.06 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN B-1 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   All proposals for residential development within the B-1 Central Business
District shall be reviewed on an individual basis by the Design Review
Committee. Proposals shall be subject to the requirements of this section as
well as other sections as deemed necessary by the Committee, based on the
nature of the project.
   (a)   New Residential Development Projects. The ground floor or basement
level gross floor area can be devoted to commercial or office space use in mid
to high-rise development proposals. Commercial uses not directly related to the
rental or sale of the units are not permitted in low-rise or garden-style
residential proposals.
      Principal buildings shall be set back from the right of way a minimum of
twenty-five feet. No parking is permitted in this setback area. Side and rear
setback from the right of way shall be a minimum of fifteen feet.
      When two or more buildings are proposed for the same site, they shall be
a minimum of thirty feet apart, with no dwelling unit facing the rear of any
other dwelling unit or structure. Garden-style and townhouse development are
limited to a minimum of four or maximum of eight units per building. Parking
shall be provided at the rate of 1.25 spaces per dwelling unit, or one space
for every three units when the development is solely for elderly housing.
Additional parking spaces required for commercial or office uses shall also be
provided as stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance.
      Parking in secured, covered garages or underground structures is
encouraged. In the case of townhouse development, when individual attached
garages are proposed for each dwelling unit the balance of the parking
requirement shall be provided for in off-street parking bays. Where attached
garages are not provided, separate garage structures, off street parking bays
or some combination is expected. All surface parking lot shall be located in
the rear of the development and shall be pursuant to the requirements of
Section
1102.04.
   (b)   Apartment Conversions: Existing Buildings. The following requirements
shall apply to existing buildings which are being converted into apartments,
lofts or other residential units.
      Developers are encouraged to retain and promote commercial or office uses
at the ground level. All changes to the exterior of the building shall conform
to the requirements of Section
1102.03.
      Where front, side or rear yards are present, they should be landscaped.
Such yards and vacated alleyways leading to or from the block's interior should
be designed to accommodate a plaza or open space suitable for passive
recreation for the tenants. Developers are encouraged to remove existing
pavement in these areas and to sod or seed with grass or other ground cover.
The planting of some combination of trees, shrubs, flowers and ground cover is
recommended at the ground level or in planters. Building entranceways shall be
landscaped and lighted. Where an existing building is on the property line
adjacent to a public right of way, the developer is encouraged to participate
in the Streetscape Program as described in Section
1102.07. Consideration should be given to building security systems.
      Parking is required and shall be supplied at 1.25 spaces per dwelling
unit. When on site, the design of parking lots shall follow the requirements of
Section
1102.04. However, due to the nature of the development, land for the required
parking may not be available on site. The required parking shall therefore be
provided on a permanent basis in a private or leased lot that is located within
300 feet of the building entrance. (Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)
   1102.07 STREETSCAPE PROGRAM.
   Because zoning does not require setback requirements in the Central Business
District, construction can and often does take place to the property line. This
leaves little space for landscaping or other visual relief, except in the
public right of way.
   The City mandates through Section
913.05 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code that the property
owner has the responsibility of keeping land, including paved sidewalks,
sidewalk areas including driveways and grass strips abutting such land in
repair and free from nuisance. Where the property owner would like to get
further involved with landscaping the right of way abutting his property, the
following guidelines are set up.
   (a)   Paving. The continuation of the downtown design theme is encouraged
through the use of decorative paving materials in earthtone colors,
particularly in walkways, building entrance areas, median strips, tree cut-outs
or other appropriate areas of public right of way.
   (b)   Landscaping. When street trees are planted, they should have two and
one-half inch minimum diameter trunks and should be placed thirty-five to forty
feet apart. Tree guards should be utilized to protect trunks from damage. Tree
cut-outs should provide for adequate drainage and aeration. All attempts to
landscape are encouraged, whether directly at ground level or through the use
of attractive planters.
   (c)   Any street furniture that is proposed such as benches, trash
receptacles, planters and the like, shall be placed out of direct pedestrian
circulation; and shall conform to requirements set up in Section
1102.03(b) to (g)
   (d)   Plans for streetscape proposals shall be made available to the Design
Review Committee for their review and approval. (Ord. 94-528. Passed 1-11-95.)

   1103.08 PROTECTION OF ROADS; WATER AND SEWER LINES.
   The landowner shall be responsible for repairing any damage to public
streets and highways, water lines, sanitary sewer lines and storm sewer
facilities caused by or associated with the timber harvesting operation. If, in

   1103.10 RIGHT OF APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   Any person, landowner or operator who has a bona fide controversy with the

permit, be permitted to file with the Deputy Director of Planning an appeal in
writing to the Board of Engineering and Zoning Appeals as hereinafter provided.
   The appeal shall be based on one or both of the following grounds, to wit:
    (a)    That the action of the Deputy Director of Planning constituted an
erroneous application of the provisions of this chapter, related laws and
ordinances, or was otherwise contrary to law; and/or
    (b)    That the action of the Deputy Director of Planning imposes an undue
hardship on the complainant, and a modified application or alternative
arrangement is available and feasible, whereby the hardship can be relieved
without defeating the purpose and intent of this chapter.
   The complainant shall set forth in his petition on appeal the
interpretation, ruling or order appealed from, and the provisions of this
chapter and related laws and ordinances involved, and shall state wherein the
interpretation, ruling or order is erroneous. If the appeal is based on the
grounds of hardship, the petition shall show the nature of the hardship and
point out what kind of modified application or alternative arrangement can be
put into effect which shall relieve the hardship without defeating the purpose
and intent of the provisions of this chapter.
   No appeal shall be accepted for filing, unless the complainant at the time
of filing the appeal, deposits with the Deputy Director of Planning the
nonrefundable sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) which shall be
submitted to the Director of Finance, to compensate the City for the costs and
expenditures incurred by the City as a result of such appeal.
(Ord. 00-175. Passed 5-22-00.)
   1103.11 INSPECTIONS; SUSPENSION OF OPERATIONS.
   (a)    The Deputy Director of Planning may go upon the site of any timber
harvesting operation before, during, or after active logging to review the
logging plan or any other required documents for compliance with these
regulations, and inspect the operation for compliance with the logging plan and
other on-site requirements of these regulations.
   (b)    Upon finding that a timber harvesting operation is in violation of
any provisions of these regulations or of the logging plan, the Deputy Director
of Planning shall order the operation suspended until such time as the
operation is brought into compliance with these regulations.
(Ord. 00-175. Passed 5-22-00.)
   1103.12 LIABILITY OF CITY.
   Failure of the Deputy Director of Planning or any official or public
employee of the City to observe or recognize hazardous conditions or to
recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the landowner or operator from
liability for the condition or for injury to persons or property resulting
therefrom. The issuance or denial of a logging permit or any action by the City
under this chapter shall not create in the City, its officers, agents or
employees any liability or responsibility for injury to persons or property
caused by or related to such action. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed
to relieve the landowner or operator from liability for injury to persons or
property.
(Ord. 00-175. Passed 5-22-00.)
   1103.13 DUTIES OF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING; CITY ENGINEER; LAW DIRECTOR.

shall consult with the City Engineer for technical assistance in the
administration and enforcement of these regulations. The Law Director shall,
immediately upon a violation of these regulations having been called to his
attention, institute appropriate legal action.

   1103.99 PENALTY.
   Any landowner or operator who violates any terms or provisions of this
chapter or fails to comply with a suspension order issued under Section
1103.11 shall be deemed to be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. Each
day's violation shall be deemed to be a separate offense.

   1104.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDING.
   It is hereby found and determined that there exist within the City of
Youngstown premises that by reason of age, obsolescence, dilapidation,
deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or the occurrence of drug
offences, prostitution, gambling and other criminal acts which constitute
public nuisances at the premises or combination thereof constitute a blight and
a nuisance upon the surrounding neighborhood because such premises are fire
hazards, health hazards, places of retreat for immoral or criminal purposes or
for the breach of the public peace, substantial and unreasonable interferences
with the reasonable and lawful use and enjoyment of other premises in the
neighborhood, or factors seriously depreciating property values in the area. It
is further found that programs aimed at specific elimination of particular
blights or nuisances involved in neighborhoods of the City of Youngstown have
sometimes proven inadequate or ineffective, have sometimes failed to prevent
recurrence of the nuisance or blight, and have sometimes resulted merely in the
alteration of the nature or form of the nuisance or blight that previously
existed. It is further found that it therefore becomes necessary in order to
eliminate nuisance and blight and prevent recurrence of blight on the premises
for the City to obtain the title of the blighted premises and to take direct
action to remove the blight or provide for its removal by others and to make
further provisions for future development, redevelopment or use of the premises
in such a way as to prevent any recurrence of blight or nuisance on the
premises. It is further found and determined that acquisition of such blighted
property by the City in order to eliminate blight or nuisance and to prevent
its recurrence constitutes a public purpose.

   “Blighted premises" shall mean premises which because of their age,
obsolescence, dilapidation, deterioration, lack of maintenance or repair or
occurrences of drug offences, prostitution, gambling and other criminal acts
which constitute public nuisances at the premises or any combination thereof,
including the ineffectiveness of House Code enforcement after lawfully issued
citations or violation notices, constitute an apparent fire hazard, place of
retreat for immoral and criminal purposes or repeated and serious breaches of
the peace constituting a public nuisance, a health hazard, a public safety
hazard or any combination thereof; constitute an unreasonable interference with
the reasonable and lawful use and employment of other premises within the
neighborhood; or constitute a factor seriously depreciating property values in
the neighborhood. (Ord. 07-17. Passed 1-17-07.)
   1104.04 NEIGHBORHOOD.

or any combination thereof.
(Ord. 07-17. Passed 1-17-07.)
   1104.07 DETERMINATION OF BLIGHTED PREMISES.
   (a)    The Community Development Director or his designee or the Health
Commissioner or his designee, with the consent of the member of Council in
whose ward the premises is located, who may use a community based group located
in the ward where the premises is located to recommend to the legislation,
shall present to Council, from time to time and as circumstances warrant,
legislation which shall list therein the location and ownership of premises
which said Director or Commissioner has reason to believe are blighted premises
and which are located within the City of Youngstown. The legislation shall
state briefly the factors which would warrant the determination that the
premises in the legislation are blighted. The premises so listed in the
legislation shall be only those blighted premises which, in the opinion of the
Director, are such that, in order to eliminate the existing blight and to
prevent future blight, acquisition thereof will be necessary for one or more of
the following reasons which shall be stated in the legislation:
      (1)    The owner of the blighted premises cannot or will not:
         A.    Eliminate the blighted condition, and/or
         B.    Prevent recurrence of the blighted condition.
      (2)    The owner of the blighted premises has not responded to a lawful
order by the City to take action to eliminate its recurrence within 30 days
after due notice of the request or order has been given by:
         A.    Posting such order or notice on the premises; or
         B.    Personal delivery; or
         C.    Mailing such order or notice to the last known address, as
listed in County property tax records, of the owner; or
         D.    Publishing in a newspaper of general circulation a notice of the
issuance of the order relating to the premises and directing the owner to
contact the Community Development Director in regard to such order.
      (3)    Direct action, short of acquisition by the City to eliminate the
blight, including but not limited to clearing the premises of the debris,
demolition of blighted structures, or barricading such structure has proved to
be unsuccessful:
         A.    To eliminate the blight; or
         B.    To prevent its recurrence.
      (4)    In the opinion of the director or directors requesting the
legislation based upon conditions existing on the premises and in the
neighborhood, such direct action would be likely to prove inadequate to
eliminate blight or prevent its recurrence.
   (b)   For purposes of subsection (a)(1) hereof, it shall be prima facie
evidence that the owner of the blighted premises is unwilling or unable to
eliminate or prevent the recurrence of the blighted condition of the premises
if:
      (1)    The blighted premises has been condemned; or
      (2)    The blighted premises is a vacant lot which has been cited by the
Health Commissioner more than three times in a one year period or where the
City has had to clean the lot at least twice during a one year period; or
      (3)    The blighted premises has been used on more than two occasions
during a one year period as the site for the commission of drug offenses,
prostitution, gambling, or other criminal acts which constitute a public
nuisance.
   The owner's unwillingness or inability to eliminate or prevent the
recurrence of the blighted condition of the premises may also be established
through testimony and documentary evidence of the Council committee hearings on
the legislation.
(Ord. 07-17. Passed 1-17-07.)
   1104.08  PUBLIC HEARING.
   Upon completion of the Administrative Review of legislation introduced in
accordance with Section
1104.07 , including submission of the legislation to the City Planning
Commission for report and recommendation, the Council shall set a date for
public hearing by the proper committee or committees thereof in regard to the
existence of blight on the premises and the necessity for acquisition of the
premises by the City in order to eliminate blight and prevent the recurrence
thereof. Said hearing shall be held not less than 30 or more than 45 days from
the time the legislation is received by the Clerk of Council at the completion
of the Administrative Review. Upon the fixing of a day for a public hearing,
the Clerk of Council shall promptly cause notice to be given to the owner or
owners of record of the premises and the known occupants thereof, if any, or
the known person in charge of the premises, if any, notifying them of the time
and place of the hearing and apprising them of their right to appear at such
hearing to show cause why the
premises should not be declared to be blighted or why the City should not
acquire said premises for the purpose of eliminating blight thereon and
preventing the recurrence of blight. Notice of such hearing shall be given by:
   (a)    Posting the notice thereon on the premises; or
   (b)    Personal service; or

or owners of record of the premises or person known in charge of the premises
or to known occupants thereof; or

the City of Youngstown.

   1104.09 PROCEDURE.
   (a)   At the public hearing required by Section
1104.08, the legislation shall be read and shall constitute prima facie
evidence of blight on the premises and the need for the City to acquire such
premises in order to eliminate the blight and prevent recurrence of blight
thereon. Thereafter, the owner or owners, person in charge, occupant of the
premises or any person having an interest therein may proceed to show cause why
the premises should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire
said premises for the purposes of eliminating blight or preventing its
recurrence. At the hearing, the owner or owners, person in charge of the
premises or occupant may cause to be presented to the committee or committees
of Council any records of the City pertaining to issues relevant to the hearing
and may examine City employees in regard thereto; provided that the production
of such records or the presence of such employees is required by the owner or
owners, person in charge or occupant of the premises in writing at least 24
hours prior to the hearing.
   (b)   If the owner or owners, person in charge or occupant of the premises
does appear and presents testimony for the purpose of showing cause why the
premises should not be declared blighted or the City should not acquire the
premises for the purposes of eliminating the blight and preventing recurrence
of blight, the director or directors requesting the legislation, or designated
representatives, shall proceed to present evidence to the committee or
committees of Council of the existence of blight on the premises and the need
to acquire the premises for elimination of the blight and the prevention of the
recurrence of the blight thereon. Members of the general public residing in the
neighborhood or who may otherwise have knowledge of the condition of such
premises may address the committee or committees at the public hearing in
regard to the proposed action by the City. The committee or committees of
Council may adjourn the public hearing, from time to time, and grant
continuances in order that further argument or evidence can be presented in
regard to the existence of blight on the premises or the need for the City to
acquire the premises in order to eliminate blight or prevent the recurrence of
blight thereon.

Regulations is to regulate non-commercial, commercial and event signage with a
comprehensive system of reasonable, effective, consistent and nondiscriminatory
sign standards and requirements. These Sign Regulations will identify
guidelines that detail specifics for signs identifying non-commercial and
commercial establishments, events and statements, while maintaining public
safety and overall community welfare. Commercial signs shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the current edition of the Ohio Building Code.
Additional guidelines for signs located in the geographic area of the city
designated as the Design Review District are provided for in Chapters
1101 and
1102 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Youngstown.
   (b)   Objectives. With these purposes in mind, City Council hereby declares
that the enactment of these comprehensive Sign Regulations is necessary to
achieve the above stated purposes and to accomplish the following objectives:
      (1)   Accommodate the advertising needs of businesses and improve the
image of business areas by creating an aesthetically attractive environment
that promotes business and is inviting to the public.
      (2)   Enhance the aesthetic quality of the City by encouraging signage
that is compatible and appropriate with surrounding buildings, landscaping and
other site features.
      (3)   Establish sign standards that will enable the public to locate
goods, services, and facilities in Youngstown easily.
      (4)   Recognize that signs constitute a uniquely public form of
communication that has effects on the public that more selective media do not.
      (5)   Reduce the confusion and visual clutter caused by proliferation,
improper placement, illumination, animation, and excessive height and area of
all signs that also compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.
      (6)   Protect the public from the dangers of unsafe signs and require
signs to be located, constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and
satisfactory manner.
      (7)   Establish sign size in relation to the scale of the lot and
building frontage along which the sign is to be placed.
      (8)   The intent of these regulations is not to limit the message content
of signs but to regulate the time, place, and manner of their display; to
balance the free speech of individuals with the collective rights of the
community.

   1105.06 REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.
   (a)   Permanent Sign Standards. The following standards apply to all
permanent signs unless specifically exempted in other parts of the Sign
Regulations or by a variance granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. In many
instances, the following standards are minimum requirements and the sign(s) may
be subject to additional requirements elsewhere in the Sign Regulations. In all
instances, signs shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
current regulations of the Ohio Building Code.
      (1)   Area. The area of a sign shall be equivalent to the total exposed
surface devoted to a sign message, including ornamentation, embellishment and
symbols, but excluding supporting structures. Listed below are additional area
definitions and specifications:
         A.   Aggregate Area. The following rules shall apply in determining
the aggregate area of all signage on a single parcel of land:
            1.   The aggregate area shall not exceed one (1) square foot of
signage per linear foot of lot frontage.
            2.   Parcels with dual frontage may calculate maximum allowable
aggregate area as the total of two (2) contiguous frontages.
         B.   Maximum Area. The maximum area of any one (1) sign shall be
determined by the following formulas:
            1.   Wall-mounted signs shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
façade on which it is mounted, up to a maximum of one hundred fifty (150)
square feet.
            2.   Projecting signs shall not exceed one-half (0.5) square foot
per linear foot of building frontage to a maximum of thirty-two (32) square
feet.
            3.   Freestanding (pole or monument) signs shall not exceed one
hundred twenty (120) square feet in size, and shall not exceed one (1)
freestanding sign per lot.
         C.   Single-Faced Signs. The area of a sign with one (1) sign face
shall be calculated as the total area of the face. In the case of cutout
letters, displays, symbols, statuaries or logos, the area will be calculated as
that area which can be enclosed within a rectangle, series of attached
rectangles, or other geometric shapes.
         D.   Double-Faced Signs. The area of a sign with two (2) sign faces
shall be calculated as one (1) sign face only as long as the sign faces are
identical and parallel.
         E.   Multi-faced (3 or more) Signs. The sign area shall be computed as
the sum of the area of all sign faces.
         F.   Multiple Signs. Whenever more than one (1) sign is hung
continuously or placed on a freestanding or projecting structure, the
combination of signs shall be considered as one sign for the purpose of
computing sign area and determining the number of signs on a parcel.
      (2)   Height. The maximum height for any freestanding sign and supporting
structure is not to exceed thirty (30) feet. Height is measured from the
average grade at the base of the sign to the top of the highest point of the
sign.
      (3)   Location. The following rules and standards shall apply in
establishing the location of signs:
         A.   No sign shall be placed so as to impede the visibility of
motorists or pedestrians.
         B.   Signage may be mounted on any side of a building.
         C.   No signs or sign structures shall be built or placed on the
sidewalk, curb or area between sidewalk and curb, or within any public right-
of-way.
         D.   Projecting signs located over sidewalks or public ways shall be
placed not less than eight and one-half (8.5) feet from the travel way to the
base of the sign. The projecting edge of the sign shall be at least two (2)
feet back from any curb line.
         E.   Freestanding signs shall be installed a minimum of six (6) feet
from the street right-of-way and five (5) feet from the side lot line. No sign
may cross the plane of the adjacent lot.
         F.   On a corner lot, freestanding signs shall not be placed within a
triangle formed by measuring twenty-five (25) feet along each right-of-way line
and connected by a hypotenuse.
      (4)   Illumination.  The following rules and standards shall apply in
establishing the type of illumination that may be used for signs:
         A.   The source of a sign's illumination (bulb or direct lamp image)
shall not be visible from any street, sidewalk or adjacent property. This shall
not preclude the use of neon sign elements.
         B.   Internally illuminated single-sided signs larger than thirty-two
(32) square feet shall have the copy in a darker color than the background.
This includes changeable copy signs.
         C.   The light from any illuminated sign shall be shaded, shielded or
directed so that the light intensity or brightness will not be disruptive to
residential property or create a distraction to a motorist.
         D.   On premises digital signs shall adhere to the timing and
brightness requirements for off premises digital signs as described in Section
 1105.08(d)(1)A. through D.
         E.   Only indirect lighting may be used for signs visible from
residential districts.
      (5)   Structural and Safety Considerations.
         A.   All exterior signs shall be designed to withstand wind and snow
loads as specified by the current Ohio Building Code. The Building Inspector
may require structural signs to be designed by an Ohio licensed engineer with
plans complete with required information and professional stamps.
         B.   All electrical service for sign lighting shall be provided with
underground or hidden devices. All such devices, as well as signage using
electrical devices, must comply with the current edition of the National
Electrical Code.
         C.   Exposed reflective type bulbs, incandescent lamps or other
illuminating devices that exceed forty (40) watts shall not be used on the
exterior surface of any sign so as to expose the face of the bulb, light or
lamp to any public street or adjacent property.
         D.   All parts of any electric, illuminated or transparent sign shall
be of metal or other materials that are not readily combustible.
         E.   Freestanding signs must be anchored in concrete unless the
structure is sufficiently small to allow alternative means of anchoring.
         F.   Wall-mounted and projecting signs shall be directly secured by
metal anchors, bolts, supports, stranded cable or braces, in such a manner as
to assure that the sign remains securely attached.
         G.   All structural components shall be compatible with surrounding
design and architectural features.
   (b)   Temporary Sign Standards.
      (1)   The area of a temporary sign shall not exceed thirty-two (32)
square feet. No temporary sign shall exceed four (4) feet in vertical
dimension.

         A.   Plastic signs (placards) less than ten (10) square feet in area
shall be allowed, however there shall be no more than one sign of this type
displayed per street frontage.
         B.   All other signs that are not permanent or included in the
permanent sign permitting process shall require a temporary sign permit as
provided in Section
1105.10.
   (c)   Maintenance Standards.
      (1)   Maintenance Requirements.
         A.   All damage must be promptly repaired.
         B.   Sign faces must be maintained in a legible condition. Sign faces
that are badly weathered, peeling, vandalized, or damaged must be considered as
requiring maintenance.
      (2)   Neglected Maintenance. If maintenance is neglected, the building
department shall notify the sign owner, in writing, of the type of maintenance
required. If the maintenance is not provided within sixty days, the Building
Inspector may revoke the permit and confiscate the sign face.
   (d)   Other Standards.
      (1)   Existing Signs. No sign or billboard erected before this code was
in effect shall be repaired or altered unless it be brought into compliance
with the requirements of this code. This section shall not prevent repairing,
or restoring to a safe condition, any part of the structural supports of any
sign.
      (2)   Sandwich Signs. Shall be permitted in commercial zones or in front
of commercial uses. Such signs shall not exceed ten (10) square feet per side
and shall be removed daily.
      (3)   Resemblance to Traffic Devices. No sign shall by reason of shape,
color, use of lighting, or other factor be similar in both size and appearance
to any traffic signal or traffic sign or railroad sign or signal in a way that
may, in the judgment of the Building Inspector or the Zoning Specialist,
interfere with traffic movement or safety.
      (4)   Vegetation Impairing Sign Visibility. For the purpose of enhancing
sign visibility, a tree, shrub, or other vegetation may not be trimmed,
removed, damaged, or destroyed if;
         A.   Its removal is prohibited or its preservation in its current
state is required by any section of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Youngstown or any other requirement or condition under any City permit, or
         B.   The owner or management of the property on which the vegetation
is located has not given express written permission for the work.
      (5)   Informal Signs. The total of all casually hand-lettered or hand-
drawn signs on a lot or building site that were not , or do not appear to have
been, designed by a sign or a graphics professional shall not exceed twelve

   (a)   General. In order to achieve the general purpose and objectives of the
Sign Regulations, it is necessary to remove all signs that are illegal,
nonconforming, prohibited and unused. Each such classification of signs
involves a varying level of impact upon the general purpose and objectives of
the Sign Regulations. The following subsections identify circumstances under
which such classifications occur and the method of correction and/or
disposition required.
  
    (b)   Removal.
      (1)    Determination of Violation. Any sign and its supporting structure
determined to be in violation of the Sign Regulations shall be removed within
thirty (30) days from the date of notice of violation, unless the Building
Inspector and/or Zoning Specialist has determined that such sign qualifies as a
nonconforming sign. If such signs are not removed from the premises by the
owner, tenant or operator following the thirty (30) days notice of violation,
such signs shall be subject to removal by the Building Inspector or his/her
designee in accordance with the provisions set forth below. The existence of

provisions of the Sign Regulations and shall be subject to penalties as stated
in Section
1105.10.
      (2)   Removal by Authorities. The Building Inspector is hereby authorized
to remove any sign determined to be in violation of the Sign Code. The Building
Inspector shall mail to the sign permittee or owner by first-class, certified
or registered mail a bill for the removal costs. Such costs shall be paid
within thirty (30) days of receipt of the bill by the owner, agent or person
having the beneficial use of the building, structure or premises upon which the
sign is located. If such costs have not been remitted to the City of Youngstown
as directed, such unpaid charge shall constitute a lien upon the real estate.
The City Law Director is hereby authorized to file a notice of lien in the
office of the County Clerk to foreclose this lien, and to sue the owner of the
real estate or sign permittee, or their agents, to recover the money due, plus
all its costs, together with reasonable attorney's fees to be fixed by the
court. Included in the expenses recoverable by the City shall be the costs,
together with all office and legal expenses, incurred in connection with
collection of the amount due hereunder. Any sign removed by the Building
Inspector, pursuant to the provisions herein contained, shall become the
property of the City and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by
the City.

Regulations by independent action of the sign owner or user upon review and
approval of an application for a permit by the Zoning Specialist. Zoning permit
fees shall be waived for any nonconforming sign brought into conformity with
the Sign Code. Building permit fees will not be waived.
      (3)   If one of the following triggering events occurs and the property
contains one (1) or more nonconforming signs, the nonconforming signs shall be
brought into conformity with the Sign Regulations within two (2) years of the
triggering event. Triggering events are:
         A.   A building permit is sought or required for construction valued
at fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or greater, or
         B.   A change in business use or activity, or
         C.   A nonconforming sign is altered, repaired or relocated, which
results in a decrease in the sign's nonconforming features.
      (4)   An area and/or height variance of up to ten percent (10%) may be
issued for an existing non-conforming sign. Only one (1) sign per property may
be granted a variance.
   (d)   Unused (Abandoned) Signs.
      (1)   All unused signs that are also nonconforming with the provisions of
the Sign Code shall be removed from the premises upon which it is located
within thirty (30) days from the date of notice of violation.

Sign Code and have a valid sign permit may remain on the premise for six (6)
months following the conclusion or termination of the reason for the sign. The
unused sign shall have the copy, text, icon or any other message delivering
features removed within thirty (30) days from the date of notice of violation.

the erection, remodeling, enlarging, moving, alteration, operation, mounting
and maintenance of all signs within all zoning districts. It also provides for
the elimination of certain signs, requiring conformance over a period of time,
and providing penalties for violations of said Regulations. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed a waiver of the provisions of any other code or

shall be heard and acted upon by the Board of Zoning Appeals only after all
other administrative procedures required for issuance of a zoning permit and
building permit have been completed. The Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized
to grant a variance when they find that unique situations require a deviation
from the provisions and that the purpose and intent of the Sign Code, as stated
in Section
1105.01, have not been violated.
   (e)   Appeal. An appeal of any action pertaining to the Sign Regulations
shall be heard and acted upon pursuant to Section 103 of the City of Youngstown

GENERAL PROVISIONS
   1305.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Youngstown has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near floodprone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City of Youngstown as identified in Section
1305.06 including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City of Youngstown.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study for Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas, both effective November 18, 2009.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
   (c)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Youngstown as required by Section
1305.25 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Youngstown City Hall, 26 S. Phelps Street,
Youngstown, Ohio 44503.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
      (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Youngstown, any officer
or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.11 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   Appeal.  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (3)   Base Flood. The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (4)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (5)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (6)   Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (7)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface    waters
from any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 1 (one) foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
LOMC's are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Youngstown
Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated July 18, 1977, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (27)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)

registered in the State of Ohio and submitted with an application for a
floodplain development permit when applicable:
      (1)   Floodproofing certification for non-residential floodproofed
structure as required in Section
1305.27. 
      (2)   Certification that fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor of a
structure not meeting the design requirements of Section
1305.26(e) are designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces.
      (3)   Description of any watercourse alteration or relocation that the
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished, and
maintenance assurances as required in Section
1305.31(c).
      (4)   A hydrologic and hydraulic analysis demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood by more than one foot in special flood hazard areas
where the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway as required by Section
1305.31(b).
      (5)   A hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis showing impact of
any development on flood heights in an identified floodway as required by
Section

floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Section
1305.32 through
1305.37, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail. (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.22 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
   (c)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and

   1305.31 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1305.20(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Youngstown and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1305.31(a)(2), items A. and C.-E.
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, state, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Youngstown, specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1305.20(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
         (Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.32 APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.

reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 09-353. Passed 11-18-09.)
   1305.35 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Youngstown.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for
a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires.
      (1)   In considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board shall
consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the following
factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1305.35(c)(1) A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the

   1307.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective March 1, 2005, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
   1307.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
   1307.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   Exceptions:
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units

having jurisdiction. This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller. (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;

in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
   1307.04 COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to

(ORC 3791.01, 3791.03)
   (c)   No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration or

the plans or drawings, specifications, and data have been approved as Ohio R.C.
3791.04 requires, or the industrialized unit inspected at the point of origin.
No plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given

rule made under those chapters.
(ORC 3791.04)
   1307.05 EXISTING STRUCTURES.

alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of

occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
   1307.06 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Adjudication Orders Required Before Legal Proceedings. Before the

it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1307.07. Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board. The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board. Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1307.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
   1307.07 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance. Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition. Failure to cease
work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public nuisance.
(OBC 114)
   1307.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio. The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders
issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743, of the Ohio Revised Code
prevail in the event of a conflict.

   The City hereby elects to utilize the procedure described in Ohio R.C.
3929.86 whereby no insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a
claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the City
where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all
policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless there is compliance with
the following procedures:
   (a)    When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief in the aggregate two
thousand dollars ($2,000) for each twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) and each
fraction of that amount, of a claim or, if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or
companies, the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed
estimate of the cost of removing or repairing the building or other structure,
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the
estimate.
Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the
cost of removing or repairing the building or other structure after the
transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the fund in
excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds; provided that the City
has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
(Ord. 16-131. Passed 4-20-16.)
   (b)    Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as
security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by
the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
When transferring the funds as required by this section, an insurance company
shall provide the City with the name and address of the named insured or
insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or insureds,
certify that the proceeds have been received by the City and notify them that
the following procedures will be followed:
The fund shall be returned to the named insured or insureds when repair or
removal of the building or other structure has been completed and the required
proof received by the designated officer. Proof of repair shall be demonstrated
by proof of inspection completed by the Mahoning County Building Inspection
Department demonstrating a Certificate of Use and/or Certificate of Occupancy.
If the City has not incurred any costs for such repair, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, such costs shall be paid from the fund and if
excess funds remain, the City shall transfer the remaining funds to the named
insured or insureds. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the
ability of the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the City and the named
insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer

costs within one year from the date the costs were incurred. Such certification

take any retaliatory action toward an occupant, lessee, or tenant who reports a
failure of the Owner to obtain a Lead-Safe Certificate, or who reports
suspected lead-based paint hazards to the Owner or to the City, or reports
other issues suggesting non-compliance with this Chapter or the City Building
or Housing Code. Retaliatory actions include, but are not limited to, any

   (a)   Properties that are vacant when a Lead-Safe Certificate is required.
When a Lead-Safe Certificate is required under this Chapter, if any Residential

becomes vacant and not yet leased to a tenant, the Owner of that property may
not lease the unit for occupancy until the Owner obtains a Lead-Safe
Certificate.

that property may not lease the unit for occupancy to a new tenant until the
Owner obtains a Lead-Safe Certificate.
   (c)   Evictions of current tenants. No Owner without good cause to evict a
tenant may cause a tenant to be evicted because the Owner does not wish to
comply with the requirements of this Chapter. No Owner without good cause may
refuse to renew a month-to-month or other periodic tenancy because the Owner
does not wish to comply with the requirements of this Chapter.
   (d)    Rights of tenants under the Ohio Landlord-Tenant Act. Nothing in this
Chapter shall be construed to limit the rights of tenants under the Ohio
Landlord-Tenant Act, including but not limited to the right to withhold rent or
terminate a tenancy in response to owner's failure to comply with the Ohio
Landlord-Tenant Act.
   (e)   Lead-Safe Certificate provided upon lease. Upon leasing a Residential
