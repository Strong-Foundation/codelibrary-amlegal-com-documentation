EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Whitehouse was

the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Whitehouse Codified Ordinances is indicated.

be submitted to the Council by a petition signed by electors of this
Municipality not less in number than ten percent (10%) of the electors voting
at the last regular municipal election which shall in no case be less than
thirty-five (35) signatures. Such petition shall designate not less than three
(3) of the signers thereof as a committee authorized to take action as provided
in this section.
   Upon initial submission to Council, the Clerk of the Council shall within
ten (10) days ascertain the sufficiency of such petition as to the count of
signatures, that appropriate date is posted, and the designated committee of
three (3) signers is so noted. Within the same ten (10) days the petition shall
be delivered to the Lucas County Board of Elections to determine the final
sufficiency of such petition and at the next meeting of Council, the Clerk of
Council shall report, if found sufficient. Council shall take final action,
either enacting, amending, or rejecting the proposed legislation within forty
(40) days after initial submission to the Council.
   If the Council fails to pass such proposed ordinance or resolution, or
passes it in some form different from that set forth in the petition, the
petitioners, through the Committee named in such petition, may, not later than
the next regular meeting of the Council, request in writing that the
legislation as set forth in this petition be submitted to a vote of the
electors. Not later than the next regular meeting thereof following receipt of
such request, the Council shall provide for submitting the petitioned ordinance
or resolution to the electors at the next general election or regular municipal
election occurring more than sixty (60) days after the filing or such request.
If such petition is signed by at least twenty percent (20%) of such electors,
or such number of electors so requested by petition, the Council shall provide
for submitting such legislation to a vote of the electors at an election to be
held at a date fixed by the Council but not later than eight (8) months after
the initial submission of such petition.
SECTION 14.02 REFERENDUM
   Within thirty (30) days after the final passage by Council of any ordinance
or resolution which is subject to a referendum under the laws of the State of
Ohio, a petition signed by electors of the Municipality not less in number than
twenty percent (20%) of the total electors voting at the last regular municipal
election may be submitted with the Council requesting that the ordinance or
resolution be repealed or submitted to a vote of the electors. Upon initial
submission to the Council, the Clerk of Council shall within ten (10) days
ascertain the sufficiency of such petition as to the count of signatures and
the appropriate date is posted. Within the same ten (10) days the petition
shall be delivered to the Lucas County Board of Elections to determine the
final sufficiency of such petition. At the next meeting of Council, if found
sufficient, the Council shall within forty (40) days after the initial
submission of such petition, reconsider such ordinance or resolution.
   At such time as a referendum petition is initially submitted with the Clerk
of Council, the ordinance sought to be reconsidered shall be suspended from
taking effect. Such suspension shall terminate when any of the following
occurs:
A.    There is a final determination of insufficiency of the petition
B.    The petitioner's committee withdraws the petition
C.    Council repeals the ordinance
D.    Thirty days have elapsed after a vote by the electors on the ordinance
   If, upon such reconsideration such ordinance or resolution is not repealed,
the Council shall provide for submitting the same to a vote of the electors at
the next general election or regular municipal election occurring more than
sixty (60) days after the initial submission of such petition; provided that if
a referendum petition is submitted at such time that the submission of the
legislation referred to therein to a vote of the electors at a general election
or regular election would not occur within a period of six (6) months after the
initial submission of such petition the Council shall provide for submitting
such legislation to a vote of the electors at an election to be held at a date
fixed by the Council but not later than eight (8) months after the initial
submission of such petition.
SECTION 14.03 RECALL
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
any elected official of the Municipality. If such person shall have served six
(6) months of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be submitted to
the Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name and address of the person
submitting the petition and the date of such submission, and deliver to such
person a receipt thereof, and attach a copy thereof to said petition. A
petition may be circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be
bound together and submitted as one instrument. Each part shall contain the
name and office of the person whose removal is sought and a statement of not
more than two hundred (200) words on the grounds for the removal. Such petition
shall be signed by at least that number of electors which equals twenty percent
(20%) of the total number of electors voting at the last general election.
   Within ten (10) days after the day on which such petition shall have been
submitted, the Clerk of Council shall determine, using the same methods as
outlined in the section on Referendum, whether or not the petition meets the
requirements thereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition
insufficient, he shall promptly certify the particulars in which the petition
is defective, deliver a copy of his certificate to the person who submitted the
petition and make a record of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a
period of twenty (20) days after such delivery in which to make the petition
sufficient and return same to the Clerk of Council for certification of
sufficiency.
   If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, he shall
promptly so certify to Council, shall deliver a copy of such petition and
certification to the officer whose removal is sought, and shall make a record
of such delivery. If such officer shall not resign within five (5) days after
the day on which such delivery shall have been made, Council shall thereupon
fix a day for holding a recall election, not less than sixty (60) days nor more
than ninety (90) after the date of such delivery. At such recall election this
question shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer) be
allowed to continue as (naming the office)?" with provision being made on the
ballot for voting 'yes' or 'no' on such question. If a majority of votes cast
shall be voted negatively ('no'), as certified to by the Lucas County Board of
Elections, such officer shall be considered as removed, his office shall be
declared vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.
The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for
appointment to the vacancy created thereby.
SECTION 14.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS
   The manner of signing, the method of circulating, the form and requirements

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be

liability of tax, penalty, or interest and the balance, if any, at the election
of the taxpayer communicated to the Commissioner, shall be refunded or

Whitehouse tax based upon such final determination of Federal Tax liability,
and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.

or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment,
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,

liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes,
penalties, or interest due.
   (h)   The Tax Return is considered received, if mailed, on the date post
marked by the United States Postal Service or on the date delivered without
mailing to the Whitehouse Tax Office.
   (i)   Extension of time for filing returns. Taxpayers granted extensions of
time for filing their Federal income tax returns may have an extension for
filing their Whitehouse Tax Return provided that a copy of the federal

   The extended date for filing the Whitehouse return will be the same as the
extended date for the federal return regardless of the original due date of the
tax return. Statutory interest of one- half per cent (1/2%) per month (Section
185.10) or fraction thereof and penalty of one per cent (1%) per month or
fraction thereof will be charged from the original due date of the return until
the date of actual payment. The extension is for extending the due date of the
tax return and does not extend the time for paying any tax due.
   If a taxpayer wishes to extend the time for filing the Whitehouse tax return
to a date other than that provided by the automatic federal extension, the
taxpayer must file such a request in writing to the Commissioner prior to the
due date of the automatic extension. The extension may be granted by the
Commissioner upon terms and conditions set forth by him or her. A taxpayer's
extension request may be denied if the taxpayer is delinquent in the filing of
any tax returns or payments of any taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (j)   The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing
such forms or from paying the tax due.
   (k)   Payments received shall be allocated first to taxes due, then to
penalties due, and then to interest due.
   (l)   The Commissioner is authorized, but is not required, to arrange for
the payment of unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of
installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the Commissioner that,
due to certain hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of tax
due. Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by
the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
   (m)   The Commissioner of Taxation is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation, subject to the approval of the Board of Review, that the return of
an employer or employers (W-2 Form), showing the amount of tax deducted by said
employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee and paid by him or them to the Commissioner of
Taxation shall be accepted as return required of any employee whose sole
income, subject to the tax or taxes, under this chapter, is such salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation.
   (n)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking
directories or such other method, or in case any person operates a division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village constituting
a portion only of its total business, the Commissioner of Taxation may require
such additional information as may be necessary to ascertain whether net
profits allocable to the Village are being distorted by the shifting of income,
apportionment of expenses, or other devices available to a common controller.
If the Commissioner of Taxation finds that a person's net profits allocable to
the Village are distorted by reasons of transactions with stockholders or with
other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or
transactions within such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity or by some other method, he may adjust such transactions so as to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village. If
necessary, the Commissioner of Taxation may require the filing of a
consolidated return.
   (o)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax due which the Village is
entitled under the provision of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder, or at his election, indicated on
the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded, provided that
no additional taxes or refunds of less than ten dollars ($10.00) shall be
collected or refunded.

benefit of the Village and any such tax collected by such employer from its
employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (f)   The offficer or the employee having control of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the return and making payment, shall be personally
liable for the failure to file the return or pay the tax due as required by
this section. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any such
employer does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior
failure of the corporation to file returns or pay taxes, penalties or interest
due.
   (g)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish Forms 1099 to IRS for
individuals or businesses to whom or which they have nonemployee compensation

thereof, a list containing the same information as required by IRS on the

payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's return to be disallowed.

withholding taxes due Whitehouse for a period of five years from the date of
the Reconciliation Form, W-2 Forms and 1099 Forms are filed.

to be filed by an employer are received on the date postmarked by the United
States Postal Service or on the date delivered without mailing by the taxpayer
to the Whitehouse Tax Office.
   (j)   The failure of any employer to receive or procure a return, or other
required form shall not excuse the employer from preparing any information
return, withholding tax returns or from filing such forms or from paying the
tax due.
   (k)   Payments received for withholding taxes due shall be applied first to
taxes due, then to penalty due, and then to interest due.

than five (5) years.
   (c)   The Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of

   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
       (A)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal
taxable income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the
intangible income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held
for the production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

the computation of federal taxable income;

reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable
income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss
carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than
necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
 186.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also

corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
          (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.    
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
 186.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.

file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
          (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to

         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold

remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
186.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
186.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section 186.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for
whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
186.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
186.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
186.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
186.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
186.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
186.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
186.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
186.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated

taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-

         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
186.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
186.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
186.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's
 net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or
loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate
taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
186.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
186.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
186.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
186.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
186.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

186.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID (REPEALED)
186.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former Section
186.081 was repealed by Ordinance 2-2022, passed May 3, 2022.)
186.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
186.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
186.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
186.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
186.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
186.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
186.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a

   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
186.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
186.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
186.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
 186.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
 186.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
186.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax

the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

186.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
 186.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
186.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
186.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
186.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
186.10 of this Chapter.

186.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other

the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
186.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
 186.99 of this Chapter for a violation of

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
186.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Ohio Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
186.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
186.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section 186.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed,
so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment
is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
 186.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

of employment of each tenant within thirty (30) days after a new tenant

said tenant and identifying each such vacating tenant.
   (C)    Refusal by any property owner of rental property of any kind located

lieu thereof, a list containing the same information as required by the IRS.

payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's return to be disallowed.
(Ord. 10-15. Passed 12-1-15.)
186.23 REGISTRATION OF TAXPAYERS.

186.97 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available

   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section re mains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
            The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs
of abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof
shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
      (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about

      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

   (a)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this Municipality whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license has
been suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2151.354, 2151.87, 2935.27, 3123.58,
4301.99, 4510.032, 4510.22 or 4510.33.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima- facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving
under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of subsection (A) of
Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or any combination of two or more violations of subsection
(A) of Ohio R.C. 4510.111, or Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section. (ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

otherwise adequate to permit medical treatment to the pregnant woman, even if
it does not comply with Ohio R.C. 2919.12.
         B.   In a manner so that the offense is applied or is construed as
applying to a woman based on an act or omission of the woman that occurs while
she is or was pregnant and that results in any of the following:

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. (ORC
2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
 
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
 
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST OF CONFINEMENT.
   (a)   Any person convicted of a criminal offense pursuant to the Village
ordinances, in the Maumee Municipal Court, and who as a consequence of such

act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of          Maximum
 Misdemeanor               Fine
First degree          $5000.00
Second degree          4000.00
Third degree          3000.00
Fourth degree          2000.00
Minor             1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified 2000.00

      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
 
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

(Ord. 6-97. Passed 6-3-97.)
909.04 PLANS TO BE APPROVED BEFORE BUILDING PERMIT IS ISSUED.

adjoining and connecting walk. All new lateral walks, from the main sidewalk to
the property line hereafter constructed shall have a uniform slope from the
main sidewalk to the property line of one-quarter (1/4) inch per foot, the low
end of the aforesaid new lateral walk being adjacent to the main sidewalk and

such person shall be immediately removed and not again employed on any part of
the work.
   (d)   The Director of Public Service may assign inspectors to the work, or
such part thereof as may be necessary; however, the presence of the inspector
will not in any way relieve the owner or contractor from any responsibility in
complying with the specifications relating to the construction or
reconstruction of walks, driveways or curb openings. Any work done or performed
contrary to this chapter or the applicable rules or specifications shall, upon
direction of the Director be made good or removed as directed.

rules and regulations the thickness, width, materials and specifications of

referred to in this chapter. Such additional rules and regulations shall be

shall be replaced. All replacement of sidewalks shall be done in accordance
with the general construction and material specifications of the Village.

serviceability and durability of restoration, the matter of appearance will be
considered in determining the area to be restored, regardless of the size of
the opening. The restoration of complete blocks will be required in all cases
and the walk shall be cut at the joints with a concrete saw and the new work
shall be joined up with the old work in a neat and workmanlike manner. The
finish shall be the same as the surrounding area. Expansion joints shall be
restored where required, regardless of whether they existed in the original
walk.
   (c)   Restoration of sodded areas. For this type of cut, every effort must
be made to replace not only the actual disturbed area, but any adjacent area
which may have been injured or destroyed by the permittee’s work. If the
existing sod can be removed and is not injured thereby, it may be replaced, but
any damaged sod must be replaced by new sod. Restoration will not be considered
complete until restored sod shall have knitted with the subgrade. Any
maintenance necessary, such as watering, shall be considered a part of the
restoration.

   (c)   All costs and expense incident to the installation and connection of
the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the
Village from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned
by the installation of the building sewer.
   (d)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the
whole considered as one building sewer; and with further exception that two
adjacent buildings may use a common building sewer within the limits of the
public right of way. In the latter case, a separate permit shall be required
for each building.
   (e)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   All material used shall be new and of first quality and acceptable to
the Superintendent. The building sewer shall be constructed of one of the
following alternative materials: a) ABS plastic truss (composite) ASTM D2661,
or solid wall pipe with minimum wall thickness of 0.29 inches for solid wall
pipe and with joints of the chemically welded type using a solid ABS coupling
on the exterior of the joints; b) PVC plastic pipe, ASTM D3034 (SDR-35) with
elastomeric gasket joints of the integral bell type; c) cast iron soil pipe,
ASTM A74, with joints complying with applicable plumbing code requirements.
   (g)   Any sewer contractor, before laying pipe or making the connection to
any wye, tee, riser or crossover, shall uncover said appurtenances to ascertain
the condition. No sewer pipe shall be laid before the representative of the
Superintendent is on the job. The sewer contractor shall determine the slope of
the building sewer from the elevations of the minimum slope being in accordance
with subsection (h) hereof. Should there not be enough fall available to
provide the minimum slope, the Superintendent shall be advised immediately.
Sewer pipe laying shall start at the connection to the public sewer. The sewer
contractor shall install a joint adaptor, if necessary, to connect the building
drain to the building sewer. The Superintendent may require either a low
pressure air test or water test on the building sewer.
   (h)   The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than
six (6) inches.
   (i)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid
parallel to and within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be
weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The
building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar
as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe
and fittings. Under no conditions shall be 90 degree bend pipe fitting by
installed into any public or private sanitary sewer line. Any public or private
utility service structure or line shall be maintained at a minimum of five feet
horizontal clearance between said building sewer and said utility, except for
water lines which shall be maintained at a minimum of 10 feet horizontal
clearance, unless that part of the building sewer that is located within 10
feet of a water line shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe. No other
utilities will be permitted in the same trench as the building sewer.
   (j)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, wastewater carried by such drain shall be
lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (k)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise permitted or required by the
Superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with
ASTM Specification C 12, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work
has been inspected.
   (l)   All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
   (m)   The Village cannot guarantee the exact location of any existing wye,
tee, riser or crossover. The connection of the building sewer into the public
sewer shall be made at a riser, tee or wye, if such outlet is available at a
suitable location. Where no properly located outlet is available in the public
sewer, the owner shall at his expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer to
receive the building sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle
of about 45 degrees and at the location specified by the Superintendent. The
connection of the building sewer to the public sewer shall, in general, by
above and near the spring line of the sewer, but never in the top of the public
sewer. A 45 degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end
cut so as not be extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. A smooth,
neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by
approved waterproof joint material before encasing in concrete. Concrete
encasement shall not be considered waterproof. Special fittings may be used for
the connection only when approved by the Superintendent. Any damage to the
public sewer pipe during installation of the connection shall require
replacement of the entire length of sewer pipe damaged, at the sewer
contractor’s expense.
   (n)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent 48 hours before an inspection and connection to the public sewer
is made. All notifications of this kind shall include and permit number and the
location. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the
Superintendent or his representative. The Superintendent, or any person
authorized by him, must be permitted at all times to inspect all work, material
and fixtures.
   (o)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, driveways, sewers, utilities and other public or private
property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Superintendent. No sewer contractor shall open any pavement
on any public or private property without first receiving written permission
from the Superintendent or proper authorities. At least 48 hours notice shall
be given for this permission. Where the trench method is used through paved or
unpaved streets, roads, driveways, alleys, etc., it will be necessary to use
granular material, preferably sand or limestone screenings, for backfill. It
shall be placed in layers of not more than six inches and tamped with a
mechanical tamp or puddled in layers at the direction of the Superintendent.
After the backfill is thoroughly compacted, it will be necessary to replace the
pavement with the same type of materials as was removed, and in no case shall
substitute paving materials be used without first securing the approval of the
proper authority. All surplus excavation must be removed from the site to a
location satisfactory to the Superintendent, leaving the berms and pavement in
substantially the same condition as before construction started. All of the
above mentioned work and material shall be performed in accordance with the
standard specifications of the Ohio Department of Transportation. At all
locations where the building sewer passes under another sewer, drainage pipe,
water main or other utility, the line passed under must be supported by 4"x4"
wood timbers, brick or concrete masonry and extra precaution will be required
in backfilling and tamping the trench in order to avoid any danger of a break,
settlement or crack in the line passed under.
   (p)   The Village may install a “Y” branch if it deems it advisable and said
“Y” branch can be used by adjacent property owners.
   (q)   A building sewer permit shall be required for all repair work

   The Village will evaluate the complete baseline report and data furnished by
the discharger and may require additional information. Within 30 days after
full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the Village shall notify
the discharger of the Village’s acceptance thereof. The Village shall issue
orders to the community where the discharger is located outlining the effluent
limitations and monitoring requirements.
      (3)   Standards modification. The Village reserves the right to amend
this chapter and the terms and conditions thereof in order to assure compliance
by the Village with applicable laws and regulations. Within 9 months of the
promulgation of a national categorical pretreatment standard, this chapter
shall be amended to require compliance by dischargers with such standards
within the time frame prescribed by such standards. All national categorical
pretreatment standards adopted after the promulgation of this chapter shall be
adopted by the Village as part of this chapter. Where a discharger, subject to
a national categorical pretreatment standard, has not previously submitted a
baseline report as required by subsection (b)(2) hereof, the discharger shall
file a baseline report with the Village within 180 days after the promulgation
of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard by the U.S. EPA.
In addition, any discharger operating on the basis of a previous filing of a
baseline report shall submit to the Village within 180 days after the
promulgation of an applicable national categorical pretreatment standard, the
additional information required by subsection (b)(2) hereof. The discharger
shall be informed of any proposed changes in the chapter at least 30 days prior
to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the chapter
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (c)   Reporting Requirements for Discharger.
      (1)   Compliance report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set forth
in this chapter or 90 days following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject to the
chapter shall submit to the Village a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an
authorized representative of the discharger.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the
County, shall submit to the Village during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently by the Village, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which
are limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In addition, this report
shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and maximum daily
flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be reported on the basis of
actual measurement, provided however, where cost or feasibility considerations
justify, the Village may accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated
by verifiable techniques. The Village for good cause shown considering such
factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other
extenuating factors may authorize the submission of said reports on months
other than those specified above.
         B.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the Village. The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard of this chapter. All analyses shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, Part 136
does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures
for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and
amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures
approved by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.
   (d)   Monitoring Facilities. Each discharger shall provide and operate at
the discharger’s own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of each sewer. Each monitoring facility shall be
situated on the discharger’s premises, except where such a location would be
impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the Village may concur
with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk area
providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There should be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance
with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of permit by
discharger.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling. The Village may inspect the monitoring
facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Village or its representatives to
enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the
purpose of inspection, sampling or records examination. The Village shall have
the right to set up on the discharger’s property such devices as are necessary
to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering
operations.
   (f)   Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the
Village with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Village that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets or proprietary information of the discharger.
   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the discharger furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
   Information accepted by the County as confidential shall not be transmitted
to any governmental agency or to the general public by the Village until and
unless a 10-day notification is given to the discharger.
(Ord. 9-89. Passed 6-20-89.)
927.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension of Service. The Village may for good cause shown
suspend wastewater treatment service to a discharger when it appears to the
Village that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens an
imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial
danger to the environment, interference with the operation of the POTW or
violation of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger
notified of the suspension of the Village’s wastewater treatment service shall,
within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Village, cease all
discharges. In the event of failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily
with the suspension order within the specified time, the Village shall commence
judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger’s
compliance with such order. The Village shall reinstate wastewater treatment
service and terminate any judicial proceedings upon proof by the discharger of
the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat
of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
   (b)   Revocation of Treatment Services. The Village may terminate wastewater
treatment services to any discharger who fails to:
      (1)   Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of
its discharges;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to the discharger’s premises by
representatives of the Village for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
   (c)   Notification of Violation - Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the
Village finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of wastewater treatment services, pursuant to this section, the
Village shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger, a written
notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within 30 days of the
date of receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond personally or in
writing to the Village, advising of its position with respect to the
allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity of
the allegations and, where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof.
   (d)   Show Cause Hearing. Where the violation of this chapter hereof is not
corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the
Village may order any discharger who causes or allows conduct prohibited by
this chapter to show cause before the Village why the proposed service
termination action should not be taken. A written notice shall be served on the
discharger by personal service, certified or registered, return receipt
requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Village
regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken,
the proposed enforcement action and directing the discharger to show cause
before the Village why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served no less than 10 days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized representative of a
discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the Village,
which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper
activities of the discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the
discharger in accordance with applicable local or State law.
   (e)   Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the Village
with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, the Solicitor for the Village may, following the authorization of such
action by the Village, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or
equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
   (f)   Enforcement Actions - Annual Publication. A list of industrial
dischargers which were the subject of enforcement proceedings pursuant to this
section during the 12 previous months whose violations remained uncorrected 45
or more days after notification of noncompliance; or who have exhibited a
pattern of noncompliance over that 12 month period or who involve failure to
accurately report noncompliance shall be published annually by the Village in
the largest newspaper circulated in Whitehouse, summarizing the enforcement
actions taken against the dischargers during the same 12 months.
   (g)   Right of Appeal. Any discharger or any interested party shall have the
right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Village on any
matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply.
In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with matters of
performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity
relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a discharger’s
request shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid
written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to this
chapter may be taken in accordance with local and State law.
   (h)   Operating Upsets. Any discharger who experiences an upset in
operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this chapter shall inform the Authority thereof within 24 hours of first
awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given
orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the Discharger
with the Village within five days. The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset’s impact
on a discharger’s compliance status.
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and, if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
A documented and verified bonafide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Village against a discharger
for any noncompliance with the chapter which arises out of violations alleged
to have occurred during the period of the upset.
(Ord. 9-89. Passed 6-20-89.)

to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractors
responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to the
Whitehouse Engineer and/or its agent. The SWP3 shall identify all
subcontractors engaged in activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The
SWP3 shall contain signatures from all the identified subcontractors indicating
that they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary
contractor prior to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3
training log to demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during earth disturbing
activities. The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Stormwater shall be directed to vegetated areas to increase
sediment removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to re-stabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability, or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff control practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment control practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or
channels alone are not considered a sediment control practice unless used in
conjunction with a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and
maintenance of erosion and sediment controls shall address factors such as the
amount, frequency, intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of
resulting stormwater runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of
soil particle sizes expected to be present on the site.
All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff to be
considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not
considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up-slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Sediment settling ponds or equivalent best
management practice upon approval from the Whitehouse Engineer and/or the Lucas
County Engineer is required for any one of the following conditions:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment baniers.
         C.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
   Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from Whitehouse.
   The sediment -settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
   When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Whitehouse Engineer and/
or the Lucas County Engineer.
   The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
   Method 1: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000 ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
   Method 2: The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
   When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and
areas which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets
and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least two units of
length for each one unit of width > 2:1 length-to-width; however, a length to
width ratio of > 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment
settling pond when the design capacity of the sediment storage zone has been
completely filled by sediment accumulations. This limit is typically reached
when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When designing sediment
settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety, especially as it
relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin and alternative
sediment controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe
design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion control measures to
achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where
intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level
contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship
between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is
shown in Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend
the size of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls. Altemative perimeter controls for
sheet flow discharges may be considered by Whitehouse but their use shall not
exceed the limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detailed drawings and plan
notes shall specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such
alternative perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices. Stormwater diversion practices
shall be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such
devices, which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff
from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be
cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard. Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned
weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without posing a
public safety hazard. Based on site conditions, the Whitehouse Engineer and/or
the Lucas County Engineer may require additional best management practices to
control off site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
            i.    Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
            ii.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from
these areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment
settling pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
931.09(d) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to wash
vehicles.
            iii.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Whitehouse Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tm.ping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State Protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources. A 50-foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be provided
around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is infeasible to
provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the SWP3 shall
comply with the stabilization requirements in Section 931.09(b)(1) for areas
within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland setbacks if
applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and, unless
infeasible, preserve topsoil. If a riparian or wetland setback is greater than
50 feet, no disturbance of natural vegetation shall occur within the riparian
or wetland setback unless a variance to the riparian or wetland setback
regulation has been granted. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas
within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be addressed
in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources or
wetlands.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         G.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
      (10)   Non-sediment pollutant controls. Liquid waste or solid waste,
including building materials, shall not be discharged in storm water runoff.
The applicant must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic
materials, hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources
or wetlands or the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to
the following:
         A.   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
         B.   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
         C.   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
         D.   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall
be stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
         E.   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      F.   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP) standards)
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
            i.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated
runoff and prevent discharge.
            ii.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer
with the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
            iii.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily or other such
methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
   The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building
materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such plan is
maintained on site.
         G.   Compliance with other requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
         H.   Trench and ground water control. There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
         I.   Internal inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24-hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Whitehouse Engineer and/or the Lucas County Engineer and all
the following conditions are met:
            i.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one
month).
            ii.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and
temporary stabilization is achieved.
            iii.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
            iv.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-
Winter Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner, developer,
engineer, contractor of the project, and Whitehouse prior to October 1, to plan
and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as defined in the most current
online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct
these inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to
evaluate whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures
are required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Whitehouse
Engineer and/or the Lucas County Engineer within seven working days from the
inspection and retained at the development site. These inspections shall meet
the following requirements:
            i.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that
are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the
potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
            ii.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by Whitehouse, Ohio, or an alternate
form acceptable to the Lucas County Engineer.
               The inspection form shall include:
               a.    The inspection date.
               b.    Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
               c.    Weather information for the period since the last
inspection, including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event,
duration of each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm
event in inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
               d.    Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
               e.    Locations of:
                  i   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
                  ii.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
                  iii.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
                  iv.    Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at
the time of inspection.
               f.    Corrective action required including any necessary changes
to the SWP3 and implementation dates.
            iii.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
            iv.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
            v.    The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following
final stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and
qualifications of personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections,
major observations relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification
as to whether the facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on
any incidents of non-compliance determined by these inspections.
         J.   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up-slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the
Whitehouse Engineer and/or the Lucas County Engineer.
      When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation
of erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be
followed:
            1.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
            2.    When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be
installed within ten days of the inspection.
            3.    When BMPs depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in accordance
with the schedule, the BMP must be implemented within ten days from the date of
the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals that the planned control
practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as
to why the control practice is not needed.
         K.   Final stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by
the Village of Whitehouse Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final
stabilization, the applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further
inspection requirement applies to that portion of the site. Final stabilization
also requires the installation of permanent (post- construction) stormwater
control measures (SCMs). Obligations under this chapter shall not be completed
until installation of post- construction BMPs is verified.
            (Ord. 5-2017. Passed 2-21-17.)
931.10 ABBREVIATED STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN (SWP3).
   (a)   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the
applicant shall submit an Abbreviated SWP3 in accordance with the requirements
of this regulation.
   (b)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall be submitted by the property owner or his/
her representative and shall be named the responsible party and shall be
knowledgeable in the requirements of the SWP3. The Village may require the
Abbreviated SWP3 be certified by a professional engineer, a registered
surveyor, certified professional erosion and sediment control
specialist, or a registered landscape architect.
   (c)   The Abbreviated SWP3 shall include a minimum of the following BMPs.
The Village of Whitehouse Engineer and/or the Lucas County Engineer may require
other BMPs as site conditions warrant.
      (1)   Construction Entrances: Construction entrances shall be built and
shall serve as the only permitted points of ingress and egress to the
development area. These entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of
aggregate stone or recycled concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in
diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and constructed in conformance with
specifications in the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be indicated on the
plan. Use for other waste and wastewater is prohibited.
      (3)   Street Sweeping: Streets directly adjacent to construction
entrances and receiving traffic from the development area shall be cleaned
daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on
these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall be cleaned weekly.
      (4)   Stabilization. The development area shall be stabilized as detailed
in Table 4.
Table 4: Stabilization
 
Area requiring stabilization             Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed area within 50 feet of a   Within 2 days of the most recent
surface water of the state and not at    disturbance if that area will remain
final grade.                             idle for more than 14 days.
For all construction activities, any
disturbed area, including soil           Within 7 days of the most recent
stockpiles, that will be dormant for     disturbance within the area
more than 14 days but less than one
year, and not within 50 feet of a stream
Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1
winter
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability, or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching and erosion
matting.
 
      (5)   Inlet Protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, including rear yard inlets. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks are not acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (6)   Silt Fence and Other Perimeter Controls. Silt fence and other
perimeter controls approved by the community shall be used to protect adjacent
properties and water resources from sediment discharged via sheet (diffused)
flow: Silt fence shall be placed along level contours and the permissible
drainage area is limited to those indicated in Table 3 in Section 931.09 of
these regulations.
      (7)   Internal Inspection and Maintenance. All controls on the
development area shall be inspected at least once every seven calendar days and
within 24 hours after any storm event greater than one-half inch of rain per
24-hour period. Maintenance shall occur as detailed below:
         A.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If the internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or
maintained within ten days of the inspection.
         B.   When BMPs fail to provide their intended function. If the
internal inspection reveals that a BMP fails to perform its intended function
and that another, more appropriate control practice is required, the
Abbreviated SWP3 must be amended and the new control practice must be installed
within ten days of the inspection.
         C.   When BMPs depicted on the Abbreviated SWP3 are not installed. If
the internal inspection reveals that a BMP has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the inspection reveals that the
planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a statement of
explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
      (8)   Final Stabilization: Final stabilization shall be detetmined by the
Whitehouse Engineer and/or the Lucas County Engineer.
         (Ord. 5-2017. Passed 2-21-17.)
931.11 POST CONSTRUCTION RUNOFF CONTROLS.
   (a)   To protect a receiving stream's physical, chemical and biological
characteristics and to assure stream functions are maintained, post-
construction storm water practices shall provide perpetual management of runoff
quality and quantity. To meet the post-construction requirements of this
regulation, the SWP3 must contain a description of the post-construction BMPs
that will be installed during construction for the site and the rationale for
their selection. The rationale shall address the anticipated impacts on the
channel and floodplain morphology, hydrology and water quality.
   (b)   Detailed drawings and maintenance plans shall be provided for all
post-construction BMPs. Maintenance plans shall be provided by the applicant to
the post-construction operator of the site (including homeowner associations)
upon completion of construction activities. Applicants may be required to
develop and implement a maintenance plan to comply with regulations for
municipal separate storm sewer systems. Maintenance plans must ensure that
pollutants collected within structural post-construction practices are disposed
of in accordance with local, state and federal regulations.
   (c)   Large Construction Activities: For all large construction activities
that involve the
disturbance of five (5) or more acres of land, or will disturb less than five
(5) acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres of land, the post-construction BMPs chosen
must be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream
channels, stream erosion control and improved water quality. Structural
(designed) post-construction storm water treatment practices shall be
incorporated into the permanent drainage system for the site. The BMPs chosen
must be sized to treat the water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance
with Ohio's Water Quality Standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQv shall be
equivalent to the volume of runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be
determined according to one of the following methods:
   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the authorized reviewing agent
that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and local long-term hourly
precipitation records, or using the following equation:
      WQv = C * P * A/12 where:
      WQv =water quality volume in acre-feet
      C =runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (See Table
4)
      P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
      A = area draining into the BMP in acres
Table 4: Runoff Coefficients Based on Land Use
 
Land Use                                          C
Industrial and Commercial                         0.90
High Density Residential (5 to 8 Dwellings/Acre)  0.70
Medium Density Residential (2 to 4 Dwelings/Acre) 0.55
Low Density Residential (1 Dwelling/Acre)         0.30
Open Space and Recreational Areas                 0.25
Agricultural                                      0.15
 
   Where land uses will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average.
   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be incorporated
into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration capacity. It is
recommended that BMPs be designed according to the methodology included in the
most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual. BMPs shall be
designed such that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment, but
short enough to provide storage available for successive rainfall events as
described in Table 5.
Table 5: Target Drain Times for Post-Construction BMPs
 
Best Management Practice (BMP)             Drain Time of WQv (Hours)
Infiltration                               24 to 48
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip           24
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basin)       48
Retention Basin (Wet Basin)                24
Constructed Wetland (Above Permanent Pool) 24
Media Filtration, Bioretention             40
 
   The applicant may request approval from the authorized reviewing agent to
use alternative structural post-construction BMPs if the applicant can
demonstrate that the alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those
listed in Table 5. Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition
if it can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing
structural post-construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of
development or if structural post- construction BMPs are addressed in a
regional or local storm water management plan. For redevelopment projects
(i.e., developments on previously developed property), post-construction
practices shall either ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the site impervious
area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination
of the two.
   (d)   Small Construction Activities. For all small land disturbance
activities (which disturb one (1) acre or more, but less than five (5) acres of
land and are not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres of land), a description of measures that
will be installed during the construction process to control pollutants in
storm water discharges that will occur after construction operations have been
completed must be included in the SWP3. Structural measures should be placed on
upland soils to the degree attainable.
   Such practices may include, but are not limited to: storm water detention
structures (including wet basins); storm water retention structures; flow
attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions;
infiltration of runoff onsite; and sequential systems (which combine several
practices). The SWP3 shall include an explanation of the technical basis used
to select the practices to control pollution where flows exceed predevelopment
levels.
   Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and
along the length of
any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to
a watercourse so that the natural physical and biological characteristics and
functions are maintained and protected (e.g., no significant changes in the
hydrological regime of the receiving water).
(Ord. 5-2017. Passed 2-21-17.)
931.12 FEES.

933.04 RULES GOVERNING THE WATER DEPARTMENT.
   Rule 1. This section shall be considered a part of the contract with every
person that is supplied with water through the waterworks system of the
Village, and every such person taking water shall be considered to have
expressed his or her consent to be governed thereby.
   Rule 2. The Village does not guarantee quality of service. The supply of
water to all parties for any purpose whatever is subject to the understanding
that the consumer is not guaranteed a fixed or continuous pressure, or a
guarantee of the water delivered as to quality, purity, as established by state
and federal regulations, or temperature, the same all being subject to the
variable conditions and maintenance of the waterworks system.
   Rule 3. Water mains may be shut off without notice. In the case of breaks in
mains, services, pumping machinery, or other waterworks equipment, and for the
purpose of tapping, extending, repairing, replacing or cleaning mains, or fire,
the water may be shut off without giving notice and no claims shall be
considered for damage of any nature whatsoever arising from such action,
although, under ordinary conditions, consumers shall be notified.
   Rule 4. The Water Department reserves the right, through its authorized
agents, to enter the premises to which its service extends, at all reasonable
hours, for the purpose of reading, repairing, installing, removing or
inspecting meters, inspecting the piping systems thereof, or for any other
purposes which it deems necessary in properly safeguarding the interests of the
Village and the consumer. When such access is refused, the water shall
immediately be turned off and not turned on again until access to enter has
been complied with and an “off/on” charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for
customers in the Village has been paid.
   Rule 5. All water services must be metered, including firelines, in
accordance with this chapter.
   Rule 6. (a)   An application for water service shall be made on the
following form, shown as Exhibit A - attached to original Ordinance 9-2001, or
a similar form as may be provided by the Water Department. All applications for
the use of water from the Village must be made in writing by the owner of the
premises on the form provided by the Water Department. When a final meter
reading is ordered for transferring service, a reading must be obtained from
the inside meter and the remote reading meter. If access to the meter is
unavailable, the water shall immediately be turned off and not turned on again
until an “off and on” charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for customer is paid.
Any party desiring water service from the Village who has a past record of
nonpayment of water rental charges shall not have water service until such time
as a cash deposit equal to one-half the prior normal annual billing amount has
been paid to the Division of Water. If a customer moves within the Village
service area, a deposit shall be required for the new address and the previous
deposit shall be refunded upon payment of the final bill for the old address.
   (b)   (i)   The Village shall require, as a condition precedent to the
provision of sewer and water utility services to any new non-resident users of
said service system of the Village, that said non-resident users sign a
contract agreement. Said contract agreement shall provide provisions for
payment obligations, rate surcharges, and further shall contain provisions for
the consent of the non-resident utility service users, their heirs, successors
in interest, and assigns, to consent to future annexation of the subject
property being served by non-resident utility services in the Village, to the
Village, in the event said annexation petitions, requests or agreements are
formulated in the future. Said contract agreement may be amended from time to
time by motion of Council and as of the date hereof is in the form shown in
Exhibit A attached to original Ordinance 9-2001 and incorporated by reference
herein.
      (ii)   Excepting therefrom certain properties located in Swanton and
Providence Townships subject to a specific water service agreement dated June
30, 2000, between the Village of Whitehouse and Lucas County, Ohio.
   (c)   If the Village is required to attempt to turn off the water service to
any customer for any violation of the Water Rules, then a charge of twenty
dollars ($20.00) for customers shall be paid, irrespective of whether or not
the water service is actually turned off.
(Ord. 9-2001. Passed 5-15-01.)
   Rule 7. Any residential meter installed after the effective date of this
section shall be a remote reading meter and inside meter.
   Rule 8. The Village shall require a permit for the installation of more than
one master meter on a service branch supplying an apartment building or a
building containing more than one distinct apartment, or more than one
commercial or industrial enterprise, when plans showing the piping arrangements
are submitted to and approved by the Superintendent. In cases where additional
meters are installed, it shall be required that:
   A.   The meters all be contained compactly or in a meter room and that each
be controlled independently of the others; and
   B.   The Village may assume responsibility for the installation and
maintenance of meters under terms of an agreement made with the owner.
Buildings containing more than two units shall have a master meter for the
building, if so desired. Condominium units will be individually tapped and
metered.
   Rule 9. Bulk water may be provided for construction, private or public,
under conditions and rates as established by the Administrator.
   Rule 10. An annual pool credit may be given on a sewer bill based on the
first time per season filling.
   Rule 11. Every meter is registered by a service number and applies to street
number and to the property owner’s name. A person making an inquiry regarding a
meter shall give the street number and, if possible, the service number.
   Rule 12. The cost of maintenance and replacement of a meter, beyond normal
wear, including a meter the titles to which may have been assigned to the Water
Department by individual owners, shall be at the expense of the customer.
   Rule 13. A property owner shall be held responsible for, and shall reimburse
the Water Department for the loss or theft of a meter which has been installed
on his or her property.
   Rule 14. Every water meter shall be furnished at the expense of the person
applying therefor, shall comply with the requirements or specifications
prescribed by the Administrator and shall be of the make, type, model and
design approved or adopted for use by the Water Department.
   Rule 15. A meter shall be removed only by an authorized employee of the
Water Department. Unauthorized persons removing or tampering with meters shall
be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
   Rule 16. When, upon inspection, a meter seal is found to have been broken
from any cause whatsoever, the water will be turned off and service not
restored until twenty-five dollars ($25.00) has been paid to the Village as
liquidated damages and expenses involved. At the Administrator’s discretion,
such fee may be waived.
   Rule 17. The Water Department reserves the right to remove a meter from any
premises and substitute another meter in its place for the purpose of making
repairs and testing.
   Rule 18. The Water Department shall, on its own initiative, undertake the
testing of a meter which, in its judgment, is registering incorrectly, without
charge to the owner.
   Rule 19. If the property owner or consumer requests the Village to test the
meter owned by him or her, the Water Department reserves the right to charge
for the cost of removing and testing the meter even if the meter is found to be
in correct working order. If a meter is found not in correct working order, the
billing for the prior quarter only shall be adjusted.
   Rule 20. A meter shall be kept freely accessible to meter readers and other
authorized employees of the Water Department and shall not be permitted to
become covered with or obstructed by rubbish or any other material regardless
of whether such meter is located in a meter vault, areaway or basement. A meter
shall not be installed in a coal bin, coal cellar or crawl space. The Water
Department reserves the right to shut off water when a violation of this rule
is not corrected following due notice of such violation to the owner by the
Water Department.
(Ord. 13-88. Passed 9-20-88.)
   Rule 21. Charges for water used shall be based on the meter consumption at
the rates legally adopted by Council. The rates for water to consumers outside
the Village shall not be less than one hundred ten percent (110%) greater than
the rates established for consumers in the Village. Current rates may be
obtained on inquiry at the office of the Water Department.
(Ord. 9-2001. Passed 5-15-01.)
   Rule 22. A water meter shall be read quarterly on a schedule established by
the Water Department. If no meter reading was obtained, the Department reserves
the right to estimate and bill for the water consumed on the basis of preceding
comparable quarterly consumption. If a meter cannot be read and an estimated
billing is sent for two consecutive quarters or twice in any twelve month
period, the property owner shall have a remote reading meter installed at the
owner’s expense. If a meter cannot be read due to an unfriendly animal in the
area of the meter, the property owner assumes full responsibility and shall
have a remote reading meter installed at his or her expense.
   Rule 23. Bills for metered water shall be rendered quarterly. Consumers may
prepay on a monthly basis. This credit shall be applied to the next quarterly
billing.
   Rule 24. A bill not paid by the fifteenth of the billing month shall be
considered delinquent and shall be subject to a ten percent (10%) penalty
charge. The water may be shut off on the fifteenth day of the month following
the billing month, provided that written notice of delinquency is forwarded by
mail to the address shown on the application for service or delivered to the
residence, at least two weeks before the shut-off. At the time of the shut off
notice, an additional penalty of five dollars ($5.00) shall be added to the
bill. When the fifteenth day of the billing month falls on a Saturday, Sunday
or a holiday, the due date shall be the next business day.
   Rule 25. When water service has been turned off on account of a delinquency,
it shall not be turned on until the delinquency has been paid, together with an
“off/on” charge of twenty dollars ($20.00) for customers in the Village.
Service will be restored when access to enter the premises is made available.
The same procedure is to be followed for an owner-requested “off/on”.
   Rule 26. The Department shall deliver bills for water by depositing the same
in the post office only as a matter of convenience to the owner or consumer.
The failure to receive bills shall not be construed to relieve any owner from
his or her obligation as to the payment of such bills.
   Rule 27. If the owner of any premises elects to have his or her tenant or
lessee pay the water charge as they accrue, such tenant or lessee does so as
the agent of the owner and such owner shall not thereby be relieved from the
payment of delinquencies that might occur. If the tenant or lessee has made
proper application and is not delinquent in payment, the owner does not have
the right to order water off without permission from such tenant or lessee.
   Rule 28. No deduction shall be made, or rebate allowed, to a consumer of
water under meter control because of alleged leakage in any water pipe, tank or
other apparatus or device. The amount of water registered by a meter shall be
charged and paid in full, irrespective of whether such water, after having been
registered, was lost by leakage, accident or otherwise. Adjustments to water
bills, other than those covered by Rule 19 hereof, shall be at the discretion
of the Water Department.
   Rule 29. The Water Department is not responsible for replacing frozen meters
nor the cost therefor. The Department reserves the right to estimate and bill
for the water consumed on the basis of preceding comparable quarterly
consumption.
   Rule 30. The installation of fire protection service connections, to supply
water to stand pipes and sprinkler systems for fire protection only, shall be
permitted when applications and plans for such service have been approved by
the Department, the Building Department and appropriate fees have been paid by
the customer.
   Rule 31. All connections to the water works mains by industrial or
commercial establishments for fire protection service shall include an inside
meter set on the line bypassing the check valve.
   Rule 32. Lines installed for fire protection shall under no circumstances be
tapped or used for the general water supply of any premises.
   Rule 33. When, upon inspection, a seal has been found broken for a cause
other than fire protection, the water will be turned off, the Fire Division
notified and service shall not be restored until twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
has been paid to the Water Department as liquidated damages and expenses
involved.
   Rule 34. The operating of fire hydrants and the drawing of water therefrom

1127.01 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS; VARIANCES.
   (a)   The proposed subdivision and its ultimate use shall be in the best
interests of the public welfare and the neighborhood development of the area.
   (b)   The tract to be subdivided should not encroach upon an area designated
for future public facilities. Such area shall be incorporated in the drawing
and reserved for one (1) year after approval thereof, or for a longer period as
may be mutually agreed upon, to allow the appropriate public agency time to
acquire such land.
   (c)   Variations, exceptions and/or modifications to these regulations may
be made by the Planning Commission in specific cases where it is deemed that
unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such variation,
exception and/or modification, provided that plats are self-contained and do
not encroach unfavorably on or interfere with the normal development of
abutting properties. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.02 LOTS.
   (a)   Lot Dimensions.
      (1)   All lots shall conform to the minimum dimensional requirements of
the Zoning Code.
      (2)   Where lots are more than double the minimum lot width and/or lot
area required for the zoning district, the Planning Commission may require that
those lots be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of
future streets where they would be necessary to serve potential lots, all in
compliance with the Zoning Code and these regulations. Depth and width of
properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial, or industrial purpose
shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities
required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in
the Zoning Code.
   (b)   Lot Arrangement. All lots shall abut on a public street or place.
   (c)   Corner Lots.
      (1)   All corner residential lots shall have extra width sufficient for
maintenance of building lines on both streets. The minimum width shall be one
hundred (100) feet.
      (2)   Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
erection of buildings, observing the minimum front yard setback from both
streets.
   (d)   Lot Orientation. In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles
to street lines (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from
this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
   (e)   Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.
      (1)   Double frontage and reversed frontage lots shall be avoided except
where necessary to provide separation of residential development from traffic
arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
      (2)   Lots shall not, in general, derive access exclusively from a major
or secondary street. Where driveway access from a major or secondary street may
be necessary for several adjoining lots, the Planning Commission may require
that such lots be served by a combined access drive in order to limit possible
traffic hazards on the street. Where possible, driveways should be designed and
arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major and
secondary arterials.
      (3)   Any lot having an area of twenty thousand (20,000) square feet or
less shall not be deeper than three (3) times its width and contain a minimum
width of ninety (90) feet.
      (4)   Any lot over twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area shall not
be deeper than two and one-half (2-1/2) times its width.
      (5)   All lots shall have a minimum lot width of ninety (90) feet and a
minimum lot depth of one hundred twenty (120) feet.
         (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.03 STREETS.
   (a)   Streets shall be planned for convenient circulation toward the
principal directions of travel, bus routes, schools and playgrounds. The
pattern shall be continuous but indirect enough to discourage an excessive
amount of through traffic. On the interior design, T-type intersections shall
be predominant, while cross-intersections shall be avoided except at major
streets. The street patterns shall include some extensions to the boundaries of
the development to provide circulation between adjoining neighborhoods.
   (b)   Street widths shall conform to the following minimums:
   Classifications               Right-of-Way Width (in feet)
   Expressway                        200
   Principal Arterial                     140
   Minor Arterial - dominant major street or main county road   100
   Major Collector - major street               100
   Secondary Major - local collector                80
   Minor Street                         66
   Alley                            20
   Such classification and widths shall conform to the designation as contained
in the Master Plan.
   (c)   Streets shall intersect each other at as nearly right angles as
possible. Intersections having more than four (4) corners shall be prohibited.
   (d)   New streets shall be a continuation of existing streets or provide a
minimum jog of one hundred fifty (150) feet from the centerline of existing
street alignment.
   (e)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not be over six hundred (600) feet in length
and the terminus shall be a circular area with a minimum diameter of one
hundred forty (140) feet. Any water mains serving a cul-de-sac shall be looped.
   (f)   A two (2) foot buffer lot shall be required at the terminus end of a
stub street which abuts unplatted/undeveloped land.
   (g)   Private streets shall be constructed to Whitehouse standards.
   (h)   Streets and subdivisions shall not be duplicated in name nor confused
with existing names. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.04 BLOCKS.
   (a)   Blocks shall be designated to accommodate lots of a size required for
the zoning district and to provide convenient circulation, service and safety
on the boundary streets. The block shall be designed so that rear lot lines
coincide with drainage courses, railroads and divisions in land use.
   (b)   The maximum length of a block shall generally be one-fourth (1/4) of a
mile or one thousand three hundred twenty (1,320) feet. The Planning Commission
may require a cross walkway in a block that exceeds nine hundred (900) feet.
   (c)   The width of a block shall be sufficient to accommodate two (2) tiers
of lots, except a single tier of lots which have a greater depth than the
minimum requirement of one hundred twenty (120) feet may be required to
separate residential development from major streets adjoining nonresidential
uses or unusual topographic or natural features. An easement for screen
planting of at least ten (10) feet in depth may be required along the lots
abutting such major street or nonresidential land use, and such easement shall
not be traversed by vehicles.
   (d)   Blocks for multifamily, commercial or industrial subdivisions shall be
adequate to accommodate the building sites and to provide the yards, service
drives, off-street parking and other required facilities. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed
12-20-16.)
1127.05 PUBLIC SPACES.
   (a)   Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of outstanding natural
and cultural features, such as scenic spots, watercourses and historic sites.
   (b)   It is recommended that when available, sites be joined by walking
trails and/or multi-use paths to existing walkway easements to provide
convenient pedestrian access to all portions of the subdivision and other areas
in the municipality, such as shopping, parks and schools.
   (c)   In cases of green space reserved for exclusive use of residents of a
project or for parkland created and maintained by a homeowners' association,
restrictions for use of the land shall be placed on the subdivision or plat
drawing and on deeds for the land.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.06 SETBACKS; BUILDING LINES.
   All lots, including commercial, industrial and residential lots, shall have
a minimum setback or building line of thirty (30) feet from the right-of-way,
except where the Zoning Code requires a greater amount. In such case the
greater of the two shall be required.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.07 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Utility easements five (5) feet in width shall be provided along the
rear of each lot and/or along side lot lines where necessary. Such easements
shall provide continuous easement to streets or alleys where necessary.
   (b)   Open ditch easements equal to the width of the required cross-section
of such ditch plus twenty (20) feet on one side shall be provided.
   (c)   Easements for enclosed drainage systems shall be a minimum of fifteen
(15) feet in width. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.08 COMMERCIAL AREAS.
   (a)   A commercial subdivision may show lots which need not conform to any
minimum width or area, but it shall show the location within which buildings
may be erected and the area that is to be reserved for off-street parking and
service areas.
   (b)   The location for vehicular movement between the area and adjacent
streets shall be indicated, and restrictions shall be recorded upon the plat
which will restrict such vehicular movement to the location shown on the plat.
   (c)   Easements may be required providing for vehicular movement through
parking areas and to and from service areas, as well as easements which can be
improved as buffer areas wherever the area adjoins property zoned for a
residential use. The installation of plantings, walls, fences or other
improvements that will ensure a satisfactory buffer, or a protective screen
within such easement, may be required.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.09 HIGH WATER LEVEL.
   No plat will be approved when more than 10% of the lots planned thereon are
in excess of one (1) feet below the high water level at the building site.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1127.10 STREET TREE REQUIREMENTS
   (a)   Prior to the approval of any final plat, a contractor/subdivider shall
prepare a Street Tree Plan for review and approval by the Village Whitehouse
Tree Commission. The subdivider/contractor shall be encouraged to confer with
the Tree Commission prior to the preparation and adoption of said plan as to
guidance and direction for said plan.

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1301.03 SCOPE.
   (a)   Application and Compliance. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code,
the Ohio Mechanical Code and the Ohio Plumbing Code shall apply to the
construction, alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair,
equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of
every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such
buildings or structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code, no plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.

   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Whitehouse, Lucas County, Ohio has
special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may
result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located

values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Whitehouse, Lucas County, Ohio as identified in subection (f) below, including
any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village of
Whitehouse.
(Ord. 10-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map, Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Study, Lucas County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
Effective August 16, 2011. (Ord. 6-2011. Passed 8-16-11.)
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Whitehouse as required by Section
1333.04 (c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of Whitehouse, Village Hall, 6925
Providence Street, Whitehouse, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances, including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Whitehouse, Ohio, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)    Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 10-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)
1333.02 DEFINITIONS.

Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths
are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of
1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected
from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
   Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation plus one foot (1’) of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Whitehouse’s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   (Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701- 27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Whitehouse
Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 19, 1981, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
floodprone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage
sustained by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a 10-year period
for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. When the combined total of all previous
improvements or repairs made during the life of the structure equals or exceeds
50 percent of a structure’s market value, that structure is considered a
substantial improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 10-2010. Passed 10-19-10.)

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.  
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the

1333.03 (j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1333.03 (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Whitehouse, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Whitehouse have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Whitehouse Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represents the
Village of Whitehouse boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Whitehouse suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the
new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Whitehouse has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1333.05, Appeals and Variances
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures in special flood hazard
area; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost
of Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 10- 2010. Passed 10-19-10.)

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1333.04 (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.- 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Whitehouse specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1333.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Fill.     The following standards apply to all fill activities in
special flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method,
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal.
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes. When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided.
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover,
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material,
      (5)   Fill shall not be placed in the designated floodway,
      (6)   Fill shall not be placed in designated wetlands.

Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Planning Commission.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Planning Commission shall
fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in
interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Planning Commission shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Planning Commission.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee as set forth in the Rate and Fee Schedule adopted by
the Village of Whitehouse, Lucas County, Ohio.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Planning Commission shall schedule
and hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least thirty (30) days before the
date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Planning Commission requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Planning Commission shall consider and make findings of fact
on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections
of these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these
regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1333.05 (d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Planning Commission, but including all
documents presented and a written record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Planning Commission shall issue subpoenas upon written request
for the attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of
issuance and service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Planning Commission prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning
Commission may appeal such decision to the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1339.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   There is hereby established a Design Review Board which shall have the
powers and duties as are hereinafter set forth in this chapter. The Board shall
consist of five members, who shall be appointed by the Mayor, subject to
confirmation from Council. Design Review Board members shall be appointed with
due regard for the need to include preservation district property owners and
professional expertise in the fields of architecture, engineering, history,
archaeology, urban planning, landscape architecture, art design or other
related disciplines. The Design Review Board shall consist of:
   (a)   An architect;
   (b)   A Council member;
   (c)   A member of the Whitehouse Historical Society, and
   (d)   Two preservation district property owners.
   If the Village does not have members from these disciplines, the Village can
enter into contracts for technical assistance.
   Members shall be appointed to serve three years, except the Council member
shall be appointed to a two-year term. For the initial year, two members shall
have one-year terms, one member shall have a two-year term, and one member
shall have a three-year term. Members shall serve until their successors have
been named and qualified. A majority of the members ip of the Board shall
constitute a quorum, and any action or decision of the Board shall have the
support of such a majority of its members.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to serve as
chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The Administrator shall provide such
staff assistance as is necessary and available. All municipal departments and
agencies shall cooperate in expediting the work of the Design Review Board.
   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations, consistent with
this chapter, governing its procedures and transactions. The Design Review
Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
certificates of appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once a year. Special meetings may be held at the call of the
chairperson of the Design Review Board.
   Within the boundaries of any preservation district, the Design Review Board
shall review any proposed new construction and alterations to property as
herein defined. The Board’s approval of such new construction and alteration
shall be secured before any owner of property may commence work thereon. In
reviewing proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a
minimum use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by
the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior as follows:
   (a)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
   (b)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (c)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
   (e)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (f)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other building or structures.
   (g)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
   (i)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.
   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of Interior’s
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design review
criteria with Council approval based on the preservation district’s predominant
architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/archaeological
attributes.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.05 TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building or zoning permit for an
alteration within the preservation district, the permit application will be
deemed as an application to the Design Review Board. All property owners within
the preservation district must receive Design Review Board approval prior to
building permit issuance.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.06 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES AND PERMITS.
   No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any designated preservation district shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the Building Department. A
certificate of occupancy shall be issued by the Building Department for the
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place,
site, building, structure, object, or work of art within a designated
preservation district unless the application for such permit is approved by the
Design Review Board through the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a preservation district proposes
new construction or alteration to any portion of a structure within the
district, he/she shall first apply for (through the Building Department) and
secure a certificate of appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The
application for a certificate shall be made with the Building Officer, together
with such plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board
may from time to time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the preservation district, and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall issue
the certificate of appropriateness.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the preservation district, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the certificate of appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five day review period that a certificate of appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object, or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Building Department of such
determination and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons for
denial and recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)   Upon denying a certificate of appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with the owner
of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to both.
The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within thirty days
from the date of disapproval, if a compromise proposal is acceptable by both
parties, the Board may henceforth issue a certificate of appropriateness.
   (g)   In the case of denial of a certificate of appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meetings shall be held at least every forty-five days after the initial
meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
certificate of appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
certificate of appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction or alteration is reached then the applicant may appeal the
decision to Council. Council may affirm or reverse the Board decision, if
Council affirms the decision, the denial of certificate of appropriateness will
stand.
         (Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.08 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   The owner of an historic structure or any structure within the preservation
district shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to
ensure its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration,
whether the building is vacant or inhabited.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.09 EXCLUSIONS.
   Normal and ordinary maintenance functions performed on buildings within the
preservation district and the removal/demolition of declared public nuisances
(e.g. fire damaged buildings) that pose a threat to the health and safety of
the general public shall be excluded from this chapter.
(Ord. 18-98. Passed 10-6-98.)
1339.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever constructs, reconstructs, alters, changes, or demolishes any
exterior feature of any structure, work of art, object, or area in violation of
this chapter, or whoever maintains, changes, or installs a sign in violation of
this chapter, shall be deemed in violation of the Codified Ordinances and such
violation shall be punishable under Section 1244.07 of the Codified Ordinances.
Each day of violation shall constitute a separate and distinct violation for as
long as one year with respect to alterations and for as long as two years with
respect to demolition. These periods correspond to those during which the Board
may delay a proposed alteration or demolition.

1351.04   Compliance required.
1351.05   Conflict of laws.

1351.07   Separability.
1351.08   Saving clause.
 
1351.01 TITLE.
   This Title Seven of the Building Code shall be known as "The Exterior
Property Maintenance Code of the Village of Whitehouse, Ohio" and hereinafter
shall be referred to as the "Exterior Property Maintenance Code" or the
"Maintenance Code."
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Maintenance Code is to protect the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare as it pertains to premises and buildings
used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. This protection is
hereinafter provided by:
   (a)   Establishing minimum standards for maintaining residential, commercial
and industrial environmental quality to preserve and achieve the presentable
appearance of existing structures and premises; avoiding blighting effects of
the substandard maintenance of structures and premises and its negative impact
on the value of surrounding properties; and eliminating hazardous conditions;
   (b)   Fixing the responsibilities of owners, operators and occupants of
structures and their premises; and
   (c)   Providing for administration, enforcement and penalties.
      (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.03 SCOPE AND APPLICATION.
   (a)   The scope of this Maintenance Code is strictly limited to the
establishment of minimum standards for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and
exterior functioning units of all structures and buildings within the Village.
No provisions of this Maintenance Code shall, in any way, directly or
indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or limit the right of, any owner
or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in such manner and
form as they may determine appropriate, consonant with other applicable
provisions of law. This Code is directed to obvious visual problems which may
occasion safety, health, welfare, or incipient blighting conditions within the
Village.
   (b)   The provisions of the Maintenance Code shall apply to all premises and
structures used for human habitation, commercial purposes, or industrial
purposes which are now or may become in the future substandard with respect to
structure, maintenance, proper drainage and sanitary conditions, or other
similar conditions which otherwise constitute a public nuisance. The existence
of such conditions, factors or characteristics adversely affect public health,
safety, morals and general welfare and leads to the continuation, extension and
aggravation of blight and its attendant negative effect on surrounding property
values. Therefore, this Maintenance Code is hereby declared to be remedial and
preemptive, and it is intended that this Maintenance Code be construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
   (c)   This Maintenance Code shall not be construed to prevent the
enforcement of other provisions of Village codes or the Ohio Revised Code that
prescribes standards other than is provided in this Maintenance Code. (Ord. 10-
2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.04 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   Every portion of a building or premises used or intended to be used for
residential, commercial, or industrial purposes, shall comply with the
provisions of this Maintenance Code, irrespective of when such building has
been constructed, altered or repaired, or premises occupied, and without regard
to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or
occupancy of the building or premises for the construction or repair of the
building, or for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to
the effective date of this Maintenance Code, except as hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.05 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   (a)   Every building, structure and land use shall meet all of the
provisions and requirements of the official zoning code, building code, fire
code and health ordinance applicable to the structure and it's intended and
present use. Where these codes require the provision of a particular facility
or equipment, or where they set a structural or installation standard, such
related parts of every structure and dwelling unit shall be maintained to the
minimum standard provided for in Chapter
1367 of this Maintenance Code or to the minimum standard provided for in the
above codes, whichever standard is higher.
   (b)   In any case where a provision of this Maintenance Code is found to be
in conflict with a provision of any zoning, building, fire, safety or health
regulation or other regulation, the provision which establishes the higher
standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and health of the
people shall prevail. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.06 EXISTING REMEDIES.
   Nothing in this Maintenance Code shall be deemed to abolish, impair, or
prevent the execution of any existing remedies related to the abatement of a
public nuisance.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.07 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
Maintenance Code is declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of this Maintenance Code, which shall
continue in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions of this
Maintenance Code are hereby declared to be severable.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1351.08 SAVING CLAUSE.
   This Maintenance Code shall not affect violations of any other resolution,
ordinance, code or regulation existing prior to the effective date of this
Maintenance Code, and any violation of such shall be governed and shall
continue to be punishable to the full extent of the law under the provisions of
those ordinances, codes, or regulations in effect at the time the violation was
committed. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)

Maintenance Code.
   (b)   Relief from Personal Responsibility. Any officer or employee of the
Village, acting in good faith and without malice, is hereby relieved from all
personal liability or costs in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted for
damage accruing to persons or property as a result of any act performed by that
officer or employee in the lawful discharge of official duties under the
provisions of this Maintenance Code, and shall be defended by the legal
representative of the Village until the final termination of the proceedings.
However, the Village will not be liable for the actions of any independent
contractor, hired by the Village to effect this Maintenance Code, for acts
outside the scope of official duties.
   (c)   Rulemaking Authority. The Enforcement Officer shall have power as
necessary in the interest of public safety, health and general welfare, to
adopt and promulgate rules and procedures to implement the provisions of this
Maintenance Code, to secure the intent thereof, and to designate requirements
applicable because of local climatic or other conditions. Such rules shall not
have the effect of waiving structural or fire protection requirements
specifically provided in this Maintenance Code, or of violating accepted
engineering methods involving public safety.
   (d)   Modifications. Whenever there are practical difficulties involved in
carrying out the provisions of this Maintenance Code, the Enforcement Officer
shall have the authority to grant modifications for individual cases, provided
the Enforcement Officer shall first find that special individual reason makes
the strict letter of this Maintenance Code impractical and the modification is
in compliance with the intent and purpose of this Maintenance Code and that
such modification does not lessen health, life, and fire safety requirements.
The details of action granting modifications shall be recorded and entered in
the official records for the property.
   (e)   Official Records. All inspections, notices, and orders shall be in
writing and be certified by the Enforcement Officer. An official record shall
be kept of all inspections and related activities of the Enforcement Officer as
long as the building or structure to which such records relate remains in
existence. All such records shall be open to public inspection during business
hours and according to reasonable rules to maintain the integrity and security
of such records. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.02 INSPECTIONS.
   The Enforcement Officer is authorized, subject to constitutional
restrictions on unreasonable searches and seizures, to make inspections of all
residential, commercial, industrial, and all other building exteriors and
premises for purposes of enforcing the provisions of this Maintenance Code.
   (a)   The Enforcement Officer, in enforcing provisions of this Maintenance
Code, is authorized and directed to make inspections either in response to a
complaint alleging the existence of a public nuisance or when the Enforcement
Officer has reasonable grounds to believe a public nuisance exists. The
identification of a person who makes a complaint pursuant to this Maintenance
Code shall be kept confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under
Ohio R.C. 149.43.
    (b)   Whenever inspections are necessary by any other department of the
Village, the Enforcement Officer shall make reasonable effort to arrange for
the coordination of such inspections so as to minimize the number of visits by
inspectors, and to confer with the other departments for the purpose of
eliminating conflicting orders before any are issued. A department shall not,
however, delay the issuance of any emergency orders.
   (c)   The Enforcement Officer or any official or employee connected with the
enforcement of this Maintenance Code shall not be engaged in, or be directly or
indirectly connected with, the furnishing of labor, materials or appliances for
the construction, alteration or maintenance of a building, or the preparation
of construction documents thereof; nor shall such officer, official, or
employee engage in any work that conflicts with official duties or with the
interests of any Village Department.
   (d)   For the purpose of making such inspections, pursuant to the Village
Charter and applicable ordinances, the Enforcement Officer may enter any
building, premises or real estate, including vacant land, or any appurtenance
thereto in the Village of Whitehouse to perform any duty imposed upon him or
her by this Maintenance Code or may apply to a judge of a court of record,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2933.21(F), for a search warrant to conduct an
inspection. Every occupant of a building, premises or real estate or any
appurtenance thereto shall give the Enforcement Officer access to any part of
the building, premises or real estate or any appurtenance thereto at all
reasonable times for the purposes of making an inspection as necessary to
comply with this Maintenance Code.
   (e)   Expert Opinion. The Enforcement Officer is authorized to engage such
expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that
arise.
      (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.03 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (a)   Whenever the Enforcement Officer determines that there is a violation
of the provisions of this Maintenance Code, notice of such violation and order
for compliance shall be given to the person or persons responsible therefore,
as hereinafter provided. No owner shall fail to comply with any notice of
violation, and no owner or other person shall obstruct or interfere with
service or the enforcement of the notice. The Enforcement Officer may issue
additional warnings to property owners nearing violation of applicable
requirements contained in the Exterior Property Maintenance Code.
   (b)   Content. Such notice of violation and order shall:
      (1)   Be in writing.
      (2)   Include a description of the real estate sufficient for
identification.
      (3)   Include a statement of the reason or reasons why the notice is
being issued, including identification of the relevant sections of the
Maintenance Code or ORC.
      (4)   Include a correction order allowing a reasonable time for the
repairs and improvements required to bring the property into compliance with
the provisions of this Maintenance Code;
      (5)   Advise that if the order to abate the conditions indicated in the
notice of violation is not complied with by the specified date of compliance,
the Enforcement Officer may:
         A.   Initiate a civil and/or criminal action against the owner, or
         B.   Cause the conditions indicated in the notice of violation to be
corrected by Village personnel or private contractor and charge the costs of
such correction as a lien upon the real estate.
      (6)   State the right of the violator to file an appeal of the notice and
to have a hearing with the Board of Zoning Appeals within fifteen (15) days of
receipt of the notice.
   (c)   Service of Notice of Violation.
      (1)   A notice of violation shall be deemed to be properly served if one
(1) or more of the following methods are used:
         A.   By personal delivery to the owner or occupant of the premises or
by leaving the notice at the premises with a person of suitable age and
discretion; or
         B.   By certified mail deposited in the United States Post Office
addressed to the person or persons responsible at his/their last known address,
with return receipt requested. If a certified mail envelope is returned with
endorsement showing that the envelope is unclaimed, then service shall be sent
by ordinary mail and the mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of mailing
which shall be filed by the Enforcement Officer. Service shall be deemed
complete when the fact of mailing is entered of record, provided that the
ordinary mail envelope is not returned by the postal authorities with an
endorsement showing failure of delivery; or
         C.   By posting a copy of the notice form in a conspicuous place on
the premises found in violation and publishing a legal notice in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Village. The published legal notice shall identify
the owners of the property, the last address, if known, of the owners, the
parcel identification, the location and nature of the violation; or
         D.   Publication in a newspaper of general circulation in Lucas County
a minimum of once per week for three (3) consecutive weeks where a copy of the
newspaper, with the notice clearly marked, shall be mailed to the owner at the
last known address and the notice shall be deemed received as of the date of
the last publication.
      (2)   When the notice of violation has been served, it shall be effective
as to anyone having any interest in the real estate whether recorded or not at
the time the order was issued, and shall be effective against any subsequent
owner as long as the conditions causing the real estate exist and the
Enforcement Officer maintains a record of the notice of violation in a public
file.
      (3)   Written or oral acknowledgement by the owner of receipt of a notice
of violation shall be evidence that the owner received the notice. An appeal of
the notice by the owner pursuant to Section
1359.08 (Appeals) shall constitute evidence of written acknowledgement by the
owner of service of the notice of violation.
   (d)   Emergencies. Whenever the Enforcement Officer finds that an emergency
exists which requires immediate action to protect the public health and safety,
a written order shall be provided to the owner reciting the existence of such
an emergency and specifying such action as necessary be taken to meet the
emergency, or such action deemed necessary by the Enforcement Officer using
Village or private contractor resources to abate the conditions causing the
emergency.
      (1)   The Enforcement Officer may declare the property as a public
nuisance or declare the structure a hazardous public nuisance pursuant to
Section
1363.02 (Hazardous Structures).
      (2)   The Enforcement Officer shall make every reasonable effort to
personally serve the owner with the order; however, it shall be adequate to
affix upon the door or entrance to the building, premises, or real estate, to
include vacant land, or appurtenances thereto, where the emergency is alleged
to exist, a placard on which shall be printed the written order issued by the
Enforcement Officer.
      (3)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this Maintenance Code, such
order shall be effective immediately and shall be complied with immediately.
      (4)   If in the opinion of the Enforcement Officer action is deemed
necessary using Village or private contractor resources to abate the conditions
causing the emergency, the Enforcement Officer shall cause a request for a
temporary restraining order to be filed seeking judicial approval for the
Village to abate the public nuisance.
         A.   The cost of any repairs shall not exceed fifty (50) percent of
the fair market value of a structure to be repaired. Determination of such
shall be made by a certified appraiser to be contracted for that purpose by the
Village.
         B.   When repairs are made or other corrective action is taken at the
direction of the Enforcement Officer, the cost of such repairs and corrective
action shall be paid by the Village and shall constitute a debt in favor of the
Village against the owner of the repaired structure.
         C.   In the event said owner fails, neglects, or refused to pay the
Village the amount of this debt within sixty (60) days from receipt of the bill
for repairs, the Village Administrator may recover the costs against the owner
in a civil action or certify the cost and expense of repairs to the county
auditor and the same shall become a lien upon the real estate.
      (5)   The owner has the right to immediately appeal the emergency order
to the Board of Zoning Appeals, but such appeal does not waive the owner's
requirement to immediately comply with the order.
         A.   If the owner appeals the emergency order, the burden is on the
Enforcement Officer to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an emergency
existed which required immediate action on the part of the owner. The owner has
the burden to prove there was not an emergency.
         B.   If the Court has issued a temporary restraining order approving
demolition or modification, an owner's appeal will not stay the Court's order.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.04 TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.
   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building or structure who has
received a notice of violation to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise
dispose of to another until the provisions of the notice of violation have been
complied with, or until such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee,
mortgagee or lessee a true copy of any notice of violation issued by the
Enforcement Officer, and shall furnish to the Enforcement Officer a signed and
notarized statement from the grantee, transferee, mortgagee or lessee,
acknowledging the receipt of such notice of violation, and fully accepting the
responsibility without condition for making the corrections or repairs required
by such notice of violation.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.05 PROCEDURE UPON FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Whenever the Enforcement Officer determines that a person or persons against
whom a notice of violation has been issued has failed to timely comply with the
notice or where Village abatement of an emergency has occurred, the Enforcement
Officer may:
   (a)   Cause to be filed against the owner a civil complaint for injunctive
relief seeking abatement or any other remedy provided by law or any other
appropriate action to prevent or terminate the conditions cited in the notice
of violation; and/or
   (b)   Cause to be filed against the owner a civil action styled "complaint
for civil forfeiture" to recover any accumulated civil forfeiture penalties of
one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) or as otherwise specified herein for each
calendar day that the owner fails to comply; and/or
   (c)   Cause to be filed against the owner a criminal complaint pursuant to
Section
1359.99. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.06 ABATEMENT OF NUISANCE BY VILLAGE AND COST RECOVERY.
   (a)   Provided that thirty (30) days notice is given in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 715.26(B), should the nuisance not be abated at the expiration of the time
stated in the notice or order of the Enforcement Officer or any extensions
granted or such additional time as may be granted upon appeal, the Enforcement
Officer shall be authorized at any time thereafter to cause entry upon such
premises and the owner shall permit such entry to take such action as deemed
appropriate to abate the nuisance, in addition to any remedies provided
elsewhere in this Maintenance Code.
   (b)   Such abatement shall not be deemed to be a limitation or restriction
on the authority of any department, division, official or employee of the
Municipality, but shall be deemed to be in addition to any authority existing
by virtue of the statutes of Ohio or any ordinance heretofore enacted by
Council.
   (c)   In abating such nuisance, the Enforcement Officer may call on any
department, for whatever assistance may be necessary to abate the aforesaid
nuisance or may, by private contract, abate such nuisance and the cost of the
contract will be paid for from Village funds specifically authorized by Council
in order to abate such public nuisance. The fees for abatement activities and
services performed by the Village of Whitehouse in carrying out its
responsibilities under this Code shall be at the rate of one hundred and fifty
($150.00) dollars per person-hour with a minimum charge of not less than one
hundred fifty ($150.00) dollars. Fees for any private abatement contracts shall
be at the rate of the private contract plus a Village administrative fee at the
aforementioned rate per person-hour.
   (d)   All costs for abating such nuisance shall be recovered in the
following manner:
      (1)   The owner(s) shall be billed directly by United States certified
mail with return receipt requested or by personally serving the owner with a
copy of such bill. In the event the certified mail envelope is returned with
endorsement showing that the envelope is unclaimed, then service shall be sent
by ordinary mail and the mailing shall be evidenced by a certificate of
mailing. If all other service fails, the billing notice may be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality once a week for two (2)
consecutive weeks.
      (2)   If the costs are not so recovered within sixty (60) days of receipt
of the mailing described above in this section, the Village in accordance with
authority granted by Ohio R.C. 715.26.1 may cause the cost of the abatement to
be levied as an assessment against the property or may commence a civil action
to recover the total costs from the owner.
         (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.07 PROSECUTION.
   In case any violation order is not promptly complied with, the Enforcement
Officer may request the Whitehouse Solicitor to institute an appropriate action
or proceeding at law to exact the penalty provided in Section
1359.99 of this Maintenance Code, and in addition thereto, proceed at law or in
equity against the person responsible for the violation for the purpose of
ordering him/her to abate such nuisance.
(Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.08 APPEAL.
   Any person affected by any notice of violation which has been issued in
connection with the enforcement of any provision of this Maintenance Code, may
request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Board of Zoning
Appeals, provided that such person shall file in the office of the Enforcement
Officer a notice of appeal on forms provided by the Village within fifteen (15)
days after the date of delivery of the Enforcement Officer's Notice of
Violation.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall provide notice, hear, and decide
appeals in the same manner as appeals taken from Zoning Code decisions. Appeals
of notices and orders (other than emergency orders) shall stay the enforcement
of the Enforcement Officer's notice and order until the appeal is heard by the
Board. The failure of the petitioner or his representative to appear and state
his case at such hearing shall have the same effect as if no petition were
filed.
   (b)   Findings. Prior to ruling on any violation notice and compliance
order, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall make the following findings:
      (1)   The violator was served with a Notice of Violation as provided for
in Section
1359.03 which stated the specific nature of the violation; all corrective
action needed to be taken to abate the violation; and a specific time period
for abatement of the violation.
      (2)   Within the time period stipulated in the Notice of Violation, the
violator failed or intends to fail to comply with the correction order by not
abating the violation, and/or by not bringing the use into compliance with the
Maintenance Code.
      (3)   Upon expiration of the date indicated for compliance in the Notice
of Violation, the property was or will be maintained in violation of specific
provisions of the correction order and/or conditions previously imposed by the
Board of Zoning Appeals as a prerequisite to the modification of a previous
compliance order.
   (c)   Court Review. Any person, whether or not a previous party of the
appeal, shall have the right to apply to the appropriate court for a writ of
certiorari to correct errors of law. Application for review shall be made in
the manner and time required by law following the filing of the decision in the
office of the Village Administrator. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1359.99 VIOLATION AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   No person shall violate any provision or fail to conform to any of the
requirements of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code or fail to comply with
any order made thereunder.
   (b)   The owner, tenant, business or person in control of property that
violates any provision of this Exterior Property Maintenance Code is guilty of
a misdemeanor of the third degree and may be fined not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each offense. A separate offense may be deemed committed
each day that such condition, violation or noncompliance occurs or continues to
exist.
   (c)   The application of the penalty provided herein shall not be held to
prevent the enforced removal of the prohibited conditions.

      (3)   The structure is occupied by more persons than permitted under
relevant health and zoning codes, or was erected, altered, or occupied contrary
to law.
   (b)   If the Health Department condemns any dwelling or premise as unfit for
human habitation or use, once the property is vacated after such Health
Department order, it shall be unlawful for any person to enter such structure
except for the purpose of securing the structure pursuant to Section
1363.04 (Vacant Building Maintenance Standards), making the required repairs,
or razing the structure. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1363.02 DESIGNATION AS A HAZARDOUS STRUCTURE.
   (a)   Any building or structure shall be a hazardous public nuisance when in
the judgment of the Enforcement Officer its condition constitutes an imminent
danger of injury or death to persons or property. Such designation shall be
warranted upon the following findings:
      (1)   The structure does not provide minimum safeguards to prevent
unlawful entry or protect occupants in the event of fire;
      (2)   The structure contains unsafe exterior fixtures or equipment which
in such disrepair or condition that such equipment is a hazard to life, health,

removing the hazardous condition, or razing the structure. Any such building
shall not be reoccupied until the Enforcement Officer determines that the
emergency no longer exists.

placarded as a hazardous structure public nuisance by the Enforcement Officer
shall be brought to a safe condition within a reasonable time as ordered by the
Enforcement Officer, by commencing the ordered repairs or razing the structure.
Any repairs or demolition undertaken shall be completed within the time period
ordered by the Enforcement Officer.
   (d)   Failure to bring the building or structure into a safe condition is a
violation of this Maintenance Code, such that the Enforcement Officer may cause
any proper legal action to be initiated on behalf of the Village to abate the
hazard to the community.
   (e)   Whenever, in the opinion of the Enforcement Officer, there is imminent
peril due to an unsafe condition, the Enforcement Official shall order the
necessary work to be done to render such structure temporarily safe pursuant to

such property shall be secured according to Section
1363.04 (Vacant Building Maintenance Standards).
   (c)   Upon abandonment of any construction project, all buildings or
structures not completed to the degree such buildings or structures have been
indicated on the plans submitted in support of a building permit, and all
building materials, signs, goods, supplies, and construction equipment shall be
removed from the site and depressions to the grade level of the lot shall be
filled. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
1363.04 VACANT BUILDING MAINTENANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   A building or structure which the Enforcement Officer has declared a
hazardous structure, abandoned, or where the Health Department has declared the
structure a public nuisance unfit for human habitation or public nuisance,
shall be secured and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this
Maintenance Code and each of the following requirements:
      (1)   All windows, doors, openings, or holes in the structure shall be

galvanized bolts or two (2) inch galvanized screws.
      (3)   The roof and flashing shall be sound, tight, and not have defects
that admit water. Roof drainage shall be adequate to prevent dampness or
deterioration in the walls or interior portion of the structure. The use of
sheets of plastic or tarpaulins or similar materials does not satisfy the
requirements of this paragraph.
      (4)   All graffiti shall be removed immediately.
      (5)   The Enforcement Officer may order the vacant building or structure
and premise shall be maintained in compliance with any all Village codes
related to sanitation, infestation, high grass and weed requirements, building

such time as the defects upon which the declaration and placarding of the
building or structure were based have been eliminated.
      (1)   The Enforcement Officer may cause any or all utilities serving such
building or structure to be discontinued by notifying the public utility or
utilities serving such building or structure that the building or structure has
been declared as being unfit for human occupancy or use and vacated or declared
and placarded as a hazardous structure.
      (2)   Such notice shall include the date the order was issued, the date
the property was first vacated or declared a hazardous structure, and a copy of
the order relating to the building or structure shall be attached.
      (3)   Upon receipt of such notice, the public utility or utilities shall
disconnect or discontinue the utility service within a reasonable time.

utility or cause resumption or reconnection of any utility which has been
discontinued or disconnected as provided herein without first obtaining prior
written approval by the Enforcement Officer.
   (c)   Reoccupancy of Buildings. No vacant building or structure that has
been declared a public nuisance unfit for human occupancy or placarded as a
hazardous structure shall again be used for human habitation or use until
written approval is secured from the Enforcement Officer. The Enforcement
Officer shall remove, or cause to be removed, such placard whenever the defects
upon which the declaration and posting or placarding action were based have
been eliminated. (Ord. 10-2016. Passed 12-20-16.)
