EDITOR'S NOTE
 
 
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

         B.   "Year" means twelve consecutive months.
            (ORC 1.44)
      (2)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding
month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the
last day for doing such act or before its usual closing time on such day, then
such act may be performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Sunday or a

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which

subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
 
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
 
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
 
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

      (2)   "Fees" include costs, taxes, assessments, utilities, fines,
reservation deposits, recreation services, penalties, payments, purchases, or
other fees a person owes to a Village Office.
   (b)   Procedure.
      (1)    Any person may pay a fee owed to the Village by a financial
transaction device.
      (2)    The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized and directed to accept payments
by financial transaction device.
      (3)    The fees that may be paid for through the use of a financial
transaction device are: costs, taxes, assessments, utilities, fines,
reservation deposits, recreation services, penalties, payments, purchases, or
other fees a person owes to a Village Office.
      (4)    The following financial transaction devices are authorized as
acceptable means of payment for fees: credit card, debit card, charge card, or
prepaid or stored value card. The uniform acceptance of financial transaction
devices among different types of fees is not required.
      (5)   The Clerk-Treasurer is authorized and directed to establish,
implement, and collect a surcharge or convenience from each person making
payment by a financial transaction device. The Clerk-Treasurer shall determine
the location of each eligible point of sale.
         A.    The surcharge or convenience fee shall not be imposed unless
authorized or otherwise permitted by the rules prescribed by a financial
institution's agreement governing the use and acceptance of the financial
transaction device. To the extent possible, the surcharge or convenience fee
shall be sufficient to cover such costs as are imposed upon the Village.
         B.   If a surcharge or convenience fee is imposed; each Village
location accepting payment by a financial transaction device shall clearly post
a notice in that office and shall notify each person making a payment by such
device about the surcharge or fee.
            1.    Notice to each person making a payment shall be provided

to that medium.

               a.    A statement that there is a surcharge or convenience fee
for using a financial transaction device;
               b.    The total amount of the surcharge or fee expressed in

or fee is not refundable.

device and the payment is returned or dishonored for any reason, the person is
returned or dishonored for any reason; the person is liable to the Village for
payment of a penalty over and above the amount of the fees due. The penalty
shall be the greater of twenty dollars or payment of the amount necessary to
reimburse the Village for banking charges, legal fees, and other expenses
incurred by the Village in collecting the returned or dishonored payment. The
remedies and procedures provided in this section are in addition to any other

   (g)   The by-laws and regulations of the Board of Cemetery Trustees shall
declare the amount of money it will accept by agreement, gift, devise, bequest,
or otherwise and hold as a permanent fund of the cemetery. The Board shall
pledge the faith and credit of the Village for the perpetual care of the lots
designated, using only the interest or income of the money. On receipt of the
sum of money so designated, the board shall issue therefor a written receipt
and acknowledgement thereof, binding the faith and credit of the Village to
forever hold such money as a permanent fund and to provide perpetual care of
the lots therein named, for the use, income or interest of such money. The
Board shall enter on the minutes of its proceedings full detail of the
obligation and shall enter the receipt and income of the money and the
expenditure thereof in detail on its books of accounts, keeping each case
separately.
 
   (h)   The Board of Cemetery Trustees shall determine the size and price of
cemetery lots, the terms of payment therefor, and shall give to each purchaser
a receipt, showing the amount paid and apertinent description of the lots sold.
Upon producing such receipt to the proper officer, such purchaser shall be
entitled to a deed for the lots described therein.
   No more shall be charged for lots than is necessary to reimburse the City
for lots than is necessary to reimburse the Village for the expenses of lands
purchased or appropriated for cemetery purposes, and to keep in order and
embellish the grounds. Provision shall be made for the interment in such
cemetery of persons buried at the expense of the Village.
 
   (i)   The Board of Cemetery Trustees shall have entire charge and control of
receipts from the sale of cemetery lots, and of laying off and embellishing the
grounds. The Board may receive donations by bequest, devise, deed or gift, or
otherwise, or money or other property, the principal or interest of which is to
be used for the enlargement, improvement, embellishment, or care of the
cemetery grounds generally, or for any particular parts or lots therein, as the
donor directs, or as the Board of Cemetery Trustees determines if no such
direction is given. The Board of Cemetery Trustees shall sell lots, receive
payment therefor, direct the improvements, and make the expenditures under such
rules and orders as it prescribes, and shall invest, manage, and control
property received by donations and surplus funds in its hands from any source.
 
   (j)   (1)   The Board of Cemetery Trustees or its superintendent shall turn
over to Council property on hand under their control or held by them as a
permanent fund, for cemetery purposes, or such money as may thereafter come to
them for such purposes, and shall render a full statement thereof, by whom,
when, and for what purpose paid. Council shall acknowledge receipt thereof to
the Board of Cemetery Trustees or its superintendent in writing signed by the
Clerk.
      (2)   By resolution duly passed and entered on the minutes of its
proceedings, Council shall pledge the faith and credit of the Village to
forever hold such money as a permanent fund, and pay to the Board of Cemetery
Trustees in semi-annual payments as interest on the funds, a sum sufficient to
provide perpetual care of the lots as agreed by the Board of Cemetery Trustees.
Council shall invest such funds and keep them invested in interest-bearing debt
of the Village, then in safe interest-bearing bonds, or in interest-bearing
certificates of deposit in financial institutions within this State authorized
by law to accept deposit and subject to inspections by either the United States
or the State. All money and the income thereof shall be exempt from taxation,
the same as other cemetery property.
 
   (k)   The Board of Cemetery Trustees shall appoint a clerk and/or a
superintendent who shall keep accurate minutes of all proceedings concerning
cemeteries.
 
   (l)   On the first Monday of January each year, or as soon thereafter as is
practicable, the Board of Cemetery Trustees shall report in writing to Council
the number of cemetery lots sold, to whom sold, and the amount received
thereof, during the year preceding, and a detailed statement of the
expenditures during the same period, showing the time and purpose of each
payment and to whom made.
   Such report shall contain a pertinent statement as to whether any funds on
hand are invested, the character of the securities thereof, and such other
matters as the Board of Cemetery Trustees deems expedient or the Village
Council requires.
 
   (m)   When, in the judgement of the Board of Cemetery Trustees, an
enlargement of any burial or cemetery grounds become necessary, or grounds or
additional cemeteries should be provided, the Board of Cemetery Trustees shall
report such fact to the Village Council and recommend such action as he deems
most expedient.
(Ord. 86-67. Passed 3-18-86.)

   (b)   The following items will be considered appropriate for payment by the
Village for professional services rendered by funeral directors to prepare

   (d)   Should it be ascertained, after any payment by the Village pursuant to
subsection (b) hereof, that such payment was made for a decedent for whom the
Village did not have such responsibility, the Village shall be entitled to any
benefits payable on behalf of such decedent by any person or agency who had the
responsibility to pay burial benefits, up to an amount totaling the payment
made pursuant to subsection (b) hereof plus the fees for the grave space and

143.03 RETIREMENT SYSTEM PICK UP.
   (a)   Effective May 20, 1990, the full amount of the statutorily required
contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio and the Police
and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund shall be withheld from the gross pay
of each person within any of the classes established in subsection (b) herein,
and shall be "picked up" (assumed and paid to the Public Employees Retirement
System of Ohio [ "PERS"] or Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund
["PFDPF"], as applicable) by the Village of New London. This "pick up" by the
Village of New London is, and shall be designated as, public employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the Public Employee
Retirement System of Ohio or Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund
by each person within any of the classes established in Subsection (b) herein.
No person subject to this "pick up" shall have the option of choosing to
receive the statutorily required contribution to the Public Employees
Retirement System of Ohio or Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund
directly instead of having it 'picked up" by the Village of New London or of
being excluded from the "pick up".
   The Village of New London shall, in reporting and making remittance to the
Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio or Police and Firemen's Disability
and Pension Fund, as applicable, report that the public employees contribution
for each person subject to this "pick up" has been made as provided by statute.
   (b) The "pick up" by the Village of New London provided by this section
shall apply to all persons that are employees of the Village of New London who
are or become contributing members of the Public Employees Retirement System of
Ohio or the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund.
   (c) The Village's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in PERS or PFDPF is hereby modified as follows, in order to
provide for a salary reduction pick- up of employee contributions to PERS or
PFDPF:
   The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise payable
under the Village policies. Such total salary of each employee shall be payable
by the Village in two parts (a) deferred salary and (b) cash salary. An
employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that employee's
total salary which is required from time to time by PERS or PFDPF to be paid as
an employee contribution by that employee, and shall be paid by the Village to
PERS or PFDPF on behalf of that employee as a pick up and in lieu of the PERS
or PFDPF employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An
employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total salary less the
amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee. The Village shall compute and
remit its employer contributions to PERS or PFDPF based upon an employee's
total salary. The total combined expenditures of the Village for such
employees' total salaries payable under applicable village policies and the
pick up provisions of this section shall not be greater than the amounts it
would have paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.
   (d) The Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the "pick up" of the statutorily
required contributions to the Public Employee Retirement System of Ohio or the
Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund for those persons reflected in
Subsection (b) herein so as to enable them to obtain the result in federal and
state tax deferments and other benefits.

New     London who are subject to the Public Employees Retirement System who
would otherwise have paid 8.5% of their income to the retirement system through

employees to 4%.
         B.   In recognition of the increase in State Contribution rates which

continue to contribute at the existing rate of 4% , and the Village will
contribute the balance of the required contribution, until further action maybe
taken to the contrary in the future by Council.
         C.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in recognition of the increase in
State contribution rates which will become effective January 1, 2007, the

the contribution of its employees to 5.5% .    In recognition of the increase
in State contribution rates which became effective January 1, 2006 , from and
after that date, the employee will continue to contribute at the existing rate
of 5.5% and the Village will contribute the balance of the required
contribution, until further action may be taken to the contrary in the future
by Council.
         B.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in recognition of the increase in
state contribution rates which will become effective January 1, 2013, the
employee will contribute at the rate of 5% , and the Village will contribute
the balance of the required contributions, until further action may be taken to
the contrary in the future by Council.
      (3)   The "Regular, Full-Time employees" mentioned hereinabove shall
include only permanent full-time employees and not probationary employees,
part- time employees, and/ or summer or seasonal employees.
   (f)    The picked up contributions authorized by this section will not be
included by the Village in the gross income of the employees for federal or

(Ord. 2012-49. Passed 12-27-12.)
143.04 DIRECT DEPOSIT.
   (a)   The compensation of any employee paid by the Village of New London
shall, upon the written authorization of the employee, be paid by direct
deposit. Such authorization shall include the designation of a financial

choosing, into an account which the employee may access; and any expenses
beyond those normally incurred by the Village and related thereto shall be
assessed against the employee’s compensation. (Ord. 2018-34. Passed 12-10-18.)
143.05 WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.
   (a)    Policy.
      (1)    The Village is committed to maintaining a collegial work
environment in which all its employed individuals in all departments are
treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in an
atmosphere which respects equal opportunities and prohibits discriminatory
practices based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including on
account of pregnancy and including sexual harassment), age, and handicap.
Workplace harassment of any kind, whether verbal or physical and whether
arising onsite, out of work assignments outside of a Village building, at
Village-sponsored community functions, or elsewhere, is unacceptable and will
not be tolerated. It is also illegal.
      (2)    This policy prohibits conduct by Village supervisors or co-workers
(or other persons allowed on the premises by the Village) which treats Village
employees adversely in connection with the terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment because of the individual's race, color, national origin, religion,
sex, age, and handicap. It also prohibits conduct amounting to harassment which
reasonably makes the workplace uncomfortable for other Village employees.
      (3)    With respect to sexual harassment in particular, for purposes of
this policy, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome and unwanted sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, non-verbal or physical
conduct of a sexual nature when:
         A.    Submission to or rejection of this conduct by an individual is
used explicitly or implicitly as a factor in decisions affecting hiring,
evaluation, promotion or other aspects of employment; or
         B.   This conduct substantially interferes with an individual's
employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to, unwanted sexual
advances; demands for sexual favors in exchange for favorable treatment or
continued employment; repeated sexual jokes, flirtations, advances or
propositions; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; graphic, verbal commentary about
an individual's body, sexual prowess or sexual deficiencies; leering;
whistling; touching; pinching, assault; coerced sexual acts; suggestive
insulting, obscene comments or gestures; and display in the work place of
sexual suggestive objects or pictures. This behavior is unacceptable in the
workplace itself and by any official, supervisor, or employee in any Village
business-related setting outside the workplace, including but not limited to
other work-related settings such as business trips, court appearances and
Village community events.
   (b) Individuals Covered by the Policy.  This policy covers conduct by all
Village employees, whether by officials, supervisors, co-workers, or non-
employees. Any Village employee who has been subject to workplace
discrimination or harassment by such a person may submit a complaint. The
Village encourages reporting of all incidents of discrimination or workplace
harassment, regardless of who the offender may be.
   (c)    How to Report a Complaint.
      (1)    The Village encourages individuals who believe they are the
subject of discrimination or workplace harassment to clearly and promptly
notify the offender that his or her behavior is unwelcome. If for any reason an
individual does not wish to approach the offender directly or if such
discussion does not successfully end the harassment, then the individual should
notify one of the following people:
            His/her immediate supervisor, or
            The Mayor; or
            The Village Clerk.
A written report of every complaint will be prepared by the recipient and
submitted to the Mayor, who will cause an appropriate investigation to be made
of every complaint.
      (2)   The Village will endeavor to keep details of any investigation
confidential to the extent practical in a given situation.
      (3)    In each case, the complaining party will be advised by the Village
as to the progress of the investigation.
   (d) Protection Against Retaliation.  The Village will not retaliate against
an individual who reasonably makes a report of discrimination or workplace
harassment, nor permit any officer, supervisor, or other employee to do so.
Retaliation is a very serious violation of this policy and should be reported
by the complaining employee immediately. Any individual found to have
retaliated against an individual for reporting discrimination or workplace
harassment, or against anyone participating in the investigation of a
complaint, will be subject to appropriate disciplinary procedures.
   (e)    Disciplinary Action.
      (1)    If the Village ultimately finds that discrimination or workplace
harassment has occurred, the harasser will be subject to appropriate
disciplinary procedures. Appropriate sanctions will be determined by Village
management according to law. In addressing incidents of discrimination or
workplace harassment, the Village's response at a minimum include reprimanding
the offender and preparing a written record. Additional action may include, to
the extent otherwise allowed by law; referral to counseling,    withholding of
a promotion, reassignment, temporary suspension without pay, reduction, or
discharge from employment.
      (2)    If an investigation results in a finding that the reporting
individual falsely and maliciously accused another of discrimination or
workplace harassment, the reporting individual will be subject to appropriate
sanctions, as determined by Village management, up through and including the
possibility of termination.
   (f) Conclusion.  The Village has developed this policy to ensure that all of
its employees can work in an environment free from discrimination or workplace
harassment. This policy will be immediately disseminated to all employees by
the Clerk-Treasurer and the Clerk- Treasurer will provide this policy to all
new employees under their appointment.
(Ord. 00-04. Passed 3-14-00.)

per day, except that Council may approve a higher rate for a specific
situation, and except that, in the case of a seminar or other function which is
being attended by the employee, the reimbursement will be at the actual rate

provisions of this section. As used in this section, "Paid Leave" means sick
leave, or vacation leave. The intent of the Leave Donation Program is to allow
employees to voluntarily provide assistance to their coworkers who are in
critical need of leave due to the serious illness or injury of the employee or
a member of the employee's Immediate Family. As used in this section,
"Immediate Family" means a spouse, child, mother or father.
   (b)   An employee may receive donated leave, up to the number of hours the
employee is scheduled to work each pay period or as provided in subsection (b)
(4) of this rule, if:
      (1)   The employee who is to receive donated leave or a member of that
employee's Immediate Family has a serious illness or injury;
      (2)   Has no accrued leave;
      (3)   Has not been approved to receive other employment related benefits;
and
      (4)   Has applied for any leave, Workers Compensation, or benefits
program for which the employee is eligible. An employee who has applied for
these programs may use donated leave to satisfy the waiting period for such
benefits, when applicable. After the waiting period, donated leave may be used
up to an amount equal to the benefit for which the employee applied, (e.g.,
seventy percent for disability leave benefits) while the employee's application
is pending approval.
   (c)   Employees may donate leave if the donating employee:
      (1)   Voluntarily elects to donate leave and does so with the
understanding that donated leave will not be returned;
      (2)   Donates a minimum of eight hours; and
      (3)   Does not, in making the donation, cause his remaining balance of
sick leave to fall below forty (40) hours.
   Leave shall be donated in the same manner in which it would otherwise be
used.
   (d)   The Leave Donation Program shall be administered on a pay period by
pay period basis. Employees using donated leave shall be considered in active
pay status and shall accrue leave and be entitled to any benefits to which they
would otherwise be entitled. Leave accrued by an employee while using donated
leave shall be used, if necessary, in the following pay period before
additional donated leave may be received. Donated leave shall not count toward
the probationary period of an employee who receives donated leave during his or
her probationary period. Donated leave shall be considered sick leave, but
shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
   (e)   Employees who wish to donate leave shall certify:
      (1)   The name of the employee for whom the donated leave is intended;
      (2)   The type of leave and number of hours to be donated;
      (3)   That the employee will not cause his minimum balance of sick leave
to fall below forty (40) hours; and
      (4)   That the leave is donated voluntarily and the employee understands
that the donated leave will not be returned.
   (f)   The Village shall ensure that no employees are forced to donate leave.
   (g)   The Village shall respect an employee's right to privacy; however, the
Village may, with the permission of the employee who is in need of leave or
that employee's legal representative, inform employees of their co-worker's
critical need for leave. The Village shall not directly solicit leave donations
from employees. The donation of leave shall occur on a strictly voluntary
basis.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (B)(2) of this

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a tax administrator may require the employer to provide the tax
administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a tax administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section 718.03 of the Revised Code.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax administrator denies the request in
an Assessment.
         (C)    A tax administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method only by issuing an assessment.
         (D)   Nothing herein nullifies or otherwise affects any alternative
apportionment arrangement approved by a tax administrator or otherwise agreed
upon by both the tax administrator and taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (i)(1) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (A)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)   The employer;
            (ii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient; or a vendor,
customer, client, or patient of a person the same.
         (B)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (C)   Any other location, if the tax administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described above solely in order to avoid or reduce the
employer's municipal income tax liability. If a tax administrator makes such a
determination, the employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the tax administrator's determination was
unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (i)(1), receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
         (A)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (B)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         (C)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (5)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (6)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (7)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
      (8)    Taxpayers may elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (9)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to
the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual
who is a resident of the Village shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for the Village.
      (10)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income,
the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised
Code by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion
of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This division applies
solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation under this section.
      (11)   When calculating the ratios described herein, the owner of a
disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
         (Ord. 2020-12. Passed 6-8-20.)
   (j)   To the fullest extent allowed by state law, on all lottery winnings,
regardless of how denominated, received by any person from any source including
by not limited to any lottery authorized, sanctioned, sponsored, conducted or
participated in by the State of Ohio, or any of its subdivisions.
      (Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (k)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee
for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under this section, the reporting location in this state at
which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or periodically reports
during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under this section, the location that the taxpayer otherwise
assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting location, provided
the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and maintained in the
taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the qualifying reporting
location designated for an employee or owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division apply to such apportionment except as otherwise
provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment.
         The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax
Administrator of each municipal corporation, with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee’s or owner’s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in this
section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the election
described in this division:
         (a)   The average original cost of any tangible personal property used
by a qualifying remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote
work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (b)   Any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   Any gross receipts of the business or profession from services
performed during the taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner
for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method.
However, a Tax Administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment
method in such a manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit
return with a municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located in that
municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 2023-22. Passed 11-13-23.)
181.03 EFFECTIVE DATES.
   (a)    The initial one percent (1%) tax provided for in Section
181.02 of the Codified Ordinances shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and
after January 1, 1974, and with respect to the net profit of businesses,
professions and other activities earned on and after January 1, 1974. Provided,
however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or other
activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that part
of the net profit for the fiscal year as shall be earned on and after January
1, 1974, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year; thereafter, the taxpayer
shall report on its fiscal year basis.
 
   (b)    The additional fifty hundredths of one percent (.50%) tax provided
for in Section
 181.02 of the Codified Ordinances shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and
after January 1, 2011 and through the period ending December 31, 2026 only, and
with respect to the net profit of businesses, professions and other activities
earned on and after January 1, 2011 and through the period ending December 31,
2026 only; provided, however, that where the fiscal year of the business,
profession or other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be
applied to that part of the net profit for the fiscal year as shall be earned
on and after January 1, 2011, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year;
thereafter, the taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis through the
period ending December 31, 2026. Recognizing that this additional income tax
requires approval from the electorate, it is the intention of Council that this
additional income tax shall remain in effect only through December 31, 2026,
and that any extension of its effective date beyond December 31, 2026 shall
require an additional, future approval by the electorate.
(Ord. 2022-14. Passed 5-9-22.)
181.04 RECIPROCITY PROVISION; CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES;
OTHER CREDITS.
   (a)    If a resident of New London is subject to and has paid a municipal
income tax due to the operation of a business or the receipt of compensation in
another taxing municipality in Ohio, such taxpayer shall be allowed a credit
against the New London tax due for the taxes accrued and paid to the other
municipality based upon a tax rate of one percent (1.00%) of income only (it
being the intention of Council that there will be no reciprocity credit for the
additional fifty hundredths (.50%) of one percent income tax effective on
January 1, 2011 or any renewal thereof), but such credit shall not exceed the
amount of New London tax levied on such compensation or from the profits of a
business, nor shall such credit or allowance be permitted for a school district
tax.
   (b)    If a resident of New London operates a business or businesses in
another taxing municipality in Ohio and the business or businesses incur a
loss, the amount of the loss is deemed primarily subject to the taxing
jurisdiction of the other taxing municipality and may not be used to reduce the
taxpayer's New London tax base.
   (c)    With respect to any income tax applicable to a "pass-through entity"
as that term is defined in Ohio R.C. 718.01, the Village of New London shall
grant a credit to taxpayers that are domiciled in the Village of New London for
taxes paid to another municipal corporation by a pass-through entity that does
not conduct business in the Village. The amount of the credit shall equal the
lesser of the following amounts:
      (1)    The amount, if any, of tax paid by the pass-through entity to
another municipal corporation in this State, apportioned ratably according to
the ownership interest of the taxpayer in proportion to the ownership interest
of all owners of the entity;
      (2)    The amount of tax that would be imposed on the pass-through entity
by the Village of New London if the pass-through entity conducted business in
the Village, apportioned ratably according to the ownership interest of the
taxpayer in proportion to the ownership interest of all owners of the entity.
   (d)    A refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed
by this chapter for each "qualifying loss," as the same is defined and limited
by Ohio R.C. 718.021, in connection with a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan, which qualifying loss is sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year.
   (e)    (1)   Except as provided in subsection (e)(2) hereof, if tax or
withholding is paid to a municipal corporation on income or wages, and if New
London imposes a tax on that income or wages after the time period allowed for
a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the first municipal corporation, New
London shall allow a nonrefundable credit, against the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipal corporation with respect to such income or wages.
      (2)   If the tax rate in New London is less than the tax rate in the
first municipal corporation, then the credit described in subsection (e)(1)
hereof shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in New London.
      (3)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
         (Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.05 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    It shall be the duty of the Fiscal Officer to annually audit the
records of the Income Tax Clerk and to conduct such other inspections and
audits as she deems appropriate to insure that proper procedures, required by
the State Code and Ordinances, are being met.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of the Income Tax Clerk, under the direct
supervision of the Village Fiscal Officer:
      (1)    To receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner
prescribed herein from the taxpayers; to keep an accurate record thereof; to
report and turn over to the Fiscal Officer, all monies so received.
      (2)    To keep accurate records for a minimum of five years, showing the
amount due from each taxpayer required to file a declaration and/or make any
return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payments
thereof.
      (3)    To enforce the provisions of this chapter and to enforce the rules
and regulations of Council, relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the
collection of Village income taxes and the administration and enforcement of
the provisions of this chapter, including provisions for the examination and
correction of returns and payments. In doing so, the Income Tax Clerk shall
have any and all of the powers and authority set forth in Sections 718.13,
718.24 and 718.26 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Income Tax Clerk
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Village from the
taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)    Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or pursuant to
regulations approved by the Council, the Income Tax Clerk shall have the power
to compromise any interest or penalty, or both, imposed by this chapter.
   (e)    A Department of Taxation is hereby created within the Office of the
Fiscal Officer. Such department of taxation shall have such deputies, clerks
and other employees as may be from time to time determined by Council, and
shall receive such salary as may be determined by Council. The Fiscal Officer
shall recommend all appointments of personnel and purchase all equipment,
supplies, and materials for the department of taxation subject to the approval
of Council. The Department of Taxation shall be charged with the administration
and operation of this chapter, under the direction of the Village Fiscal
Officer. The Fiscal Officer shall prescribe the form and method of accounts and
reports for said department, as well as the forms for taxpayer's returns and
declarations and shall be charged with the internal examination and audit all
such accounts. The Income Tax Clerk shall exhibit accurate records showing the
amount received from each taxpayer, and the date of said receipts. The Fiscal
Officer shall also make written reports to Council annually of all monies
collected hereunder during the preceding year.
   (f)    Taxpayers may submit written requests to the Income Tax Clerk for
official opinions as to whether or how certain income, sources of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The Income Tax Clerk may choose
not to offer such an opinion; however, formal opinions which are issued shall
be binding on the Village. The procedures for requesting and issuing such
opinions of the tax administrator, and their legal effect and use, shall be as
specified in Revised Code Section 718.38.
   (g)     The Fiscal Officer or his duly authorized agent or employee, may,
when it is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   In this regard, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable to the Village
corporation that arises pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The Fiscal
Officer, or designee, may consider the following standards when ascertaining
with respect to a claim whether a compromise or payment-over-time agreement is
in the best interests of the Village:
         (A)    There exists a doubt as to whether the claim can be collected.
         (B)   There exists a substantial probability that, upon payment of the
claim and submission of a timely request for refund with respect to that
payment, the tax administrator would refund an amount that was illegally or
erroneously paid.
         (C)    There exists an economic hardship such that a compromise or
agreement would facilitate effective tax administration.
         (D)    There exists a joint liability among spouses, one of whom is an
innocent spouse, provided that any relief under this standard shall only affect
the claim as to the innocent spouse. A spouse granted relief under section 6015
of the Internal Revenue Code with regard to any income item is rebuttably
presumed to be an innocent spouse with regard to that income item to the extent
that income item is included in or otherwise affects the computation of a
municipal income tax or any penalty or interest on that tax. 
         (E)    Any other reasonable standard that the tax administrator
establishes.
   The Fiscal Officer's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person. A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with
respect to a claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise
or agreement or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by
misrepresentation of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the
compromise or agreement and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties
or interest that would have accrued in the absence of the compromise or
agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (h)   Whenever a Village employee has, or will have, access to or the use of
Federal tax information, the Tax Administrator shall request that the
Superintendent of the Bureau of criminal identification and investigation
conduct a criminal records check based on the individual’s fingerprints in
accordance with Section 109.572 of the Revised Code. The Tax Administrator
shall request that criminal record information from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation be obtained as part of the criminal records check.
(Ord. 2020-12. Passed 6-8-20.)
181.06 INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF FISCAL OFFICER; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    The Fiscal Officer or his duly authorized agent or employee, is
hereby authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any employer, or
of any taxpayer or person subject to the tax, or believed to be subject to the
provisions of this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due. At or before
the commencement of an audit, the Village employee carrying it out shall
provide a Notice to the taxpayer, as specified in Revised Code Section 718.36
(A); and the procedures for carrying out the audit as specified in Revised Code
Section 718.36 shall be followed.
   Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is
hereby directed and required to furnish to the Fiscal Officer or his duly
authorized agent or employee, within thirty days following a written request by
the Fiscal Officer or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities, and opportunity for making such examination and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Fiscal Officer, or his duly authorized agent or employee, is
hereby authorized to examine any person, employer or employee under oath,
concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation, and
for this purpose may compel the production of books, Federal income tax
records, papers and records and the attendance of all persons before him
whether as parties or witnesses, wherever he believes such persons have
knowledge of such income.
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal income tax
returns, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or person
subject or presumed to be subject to the tax by any officer, agent or employee
of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the failure of
any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with any order or
subpoena of the Fiscal Officer authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation of
this chapter.
   (d)    Tax returns, investigations, hearings and all audit papers and
information connected therewith are confidential and shall be carefully
preserved so that they shall not be available for inspection by anyone other
than the proper agents of the Village for official purposes.
   (e)    Any information gained as the result of the filing of any tax
returns, investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by
this chapter shall be confidential, except for official purposes (which
includes the exchange of information with other tax authorities) and except in
accordance with proper judicial order. Any person divulging such information
shall upon conviction thereof be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the
above penalties, any employee of the Village who violates the provisions of
this section relative to disclosure of confidential information shall be
immediately dismissed from the service of the Village.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.07 INTEREST AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)    For purposes of this Section:
      (1)    "Federal short-term rate" means the rate of the average market
yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining
periods to maturity of three years or less, as determined under section 1274 of
the Internal Revenue Code, for July of the current year.
      (2)   "Applicable Interest Rate" means the federal short-term rate,
rounded to the nearest whole number per cent, plus five per cent. The rate
shall apply for the calendar year next following the July of the year in which
the federal short-term rate is determined. By the thirty-first day of October
of each year the Income Tax Clerk shall publish the Applicable Interest Rate
applicable to the next succeeding calendar year.
   (b)    Whenever a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any
other payer for any reason fails, in whole or in part, to make to the Village
timely and full payment or remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or
withholding tax or to file timely with the Village any return required to be
filed, the interest amounts and penalties prescribed in this Section shall be
paid, as follows:
      (1)    Interest shall be imposed at the Applicable Interest Rate, per
annum, on all unpaid income tax, unpaid estimated income tax, and unpaid
withholding tax.
      (2)   (A)   With respect to unpaid income tax and unpaid estimated income
tax, a penalty equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid shall be
paid.
         (B)    With respect to any unpaid withholding tax, a penalty equal to
fifty per cent of the amount not timely paid shall be paid.
         (C)   (a)   For tax years ending on or before December 31, 2022, with
respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns, a penalty of
twenty-five dollars for each failure to timely file each return, regardless of
the liability shown thereon for each month, or any fraction thereof, during
which the return remains unfiled regardless of the liability shown thereon
shall be paid. This penalty shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars for each
failure.
            (b)   For the tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, with
respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns, the Village may
impose a penalty not exceeding $25 for each failure to timely file each return,
regardless of the liability shown thereon, except that the Village shall abate
or refund the penalty assessed on a taxpayer’s first failure to timely file a
return after the taxpayer files that return.
      (3)   In addition to any interest and penalties, all of the Village's
post-judgment collection costs and fees, including attorney's fees shall be
paid by the taxpayer, employer, any agent of the employer, or any other payer.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, no penalty, interest, or other
assessment will be made for the late payment or nonpayment of estimated tax
liability in either of the following circumstances: the taxpayer is an
individual who lives in the Village but was not domiciled in the Village on
January 1 of the current calendar year; or the taxpayer has remitted through
estimated tax payments or otherwise a total amount which is at least equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of the taxpayer's tax liability for the preceding
year as shown on the return filed by the taxpayer for that preceding year,
provided that the return for the preceding year reflected a twelve month period
and the taxpayer filed a return for the preceding year.
   (c)    The Income Tax Clerk shall have the authority to abate or partially
abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when the tax
administrator determines, in the Income Tax Clerk's sole discretion, that such
abatement is appropriate.
(Ord. 2023-22. Passed 11-13-23.)
181.08 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)    The following shall be considered violations of this chapter:

penalty and interest, or any combination of tax, penalty, or interest, to the
municipal corporation that commences the person's time limitation for making an
appeal to the board of tax review and has "ASSESSMENT" written in all capital
letters at the top of such finding. "Assessment" does not include an informal
notice denying a request for refund, a billing statement notifying a taxpayer
of current or past-due balances owed to the Village, a request for additional
information, a notification to the taxpayer of mathematical errors, or other
written correspondence to a person or taxpayer that does not meet the foregoing
criteria.

Section 718.18. A taxpayer may appeal such decision within sixty days after
receipt of such service.
   (c)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two members
shall be appointed by the Council, but such appointees may not be employees,
elected officials, or contractors with the Village at any time during their
term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment. One
member shall be appointed by the Mayor. This member may be an employee of the
Village, but may not be the Fiscal Officer, the Income Tax Clerk, or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof. The term for members of the board of tax review appointed by the
Council shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a
member may serve if the member is reappointed by Council. The board member
appointed by the Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor.
   Members of the board of tax review appointed by Council may be removed by
Council by majority vote for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in
office. To remove such a member, the Council authority must give the member a
copy of the charges against the member and afford the member an opportunity to
be publicly heard in person or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not
less than ten days' notice. The decision by the Council on the charges is final
and not appealable.
   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the qualifications
for the position prescribed by this section shall resign immediately by
operation of law.
   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as the
original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a conflict of
interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, another individual may be
appointed to temporarily serve on the board in the member's place. The
appointment of such an individual shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   All members of said Board shall serve without compensation.
   (d)    A majority of the members of the Board of Tax Review shall constitute
as a quorum. The Board of Review shall adopt its own procedural rules and shall
keep a record of its transactions in the form of minutes, in a bound book, and
shall list members present at each meeting. All hearings of the Board shall be
conducted privately and the provisions of Section
181.06 with reference to the confidential character of information required to
be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be heard before
the Board of Tax Review on appeal.
   (e)    Whenever the Fiscal Officer issues a decision regarding a municipal
income tax obligation of a taxpayer by way of an Assessment or the denial of a
request for refund, the Income Tax Clerk shall notify the taxpayer at the same
time of the taxpayer's right to appeal and the manner in which the appeal may
be taken. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Income Tax Clerk and
who has filed with the Village the required returns or other documents
pertaining to the municipal income tax obligation at issue may appeal that
decision to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board; such a
request shall be in writing, shall state why the decision should be deemed
incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the Income
Tax Clerk issues the decision complained of.
   (f)    The Board shall schedule a hearing within sixty days after receiving
a request, unless hearing is waived by the taxpayer; and the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and be represented by an attorney at law, a certified
public accountant, or another representative. The board may allow a hearing to
be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing
must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise. The Board may affirm, reverse, or
modify the decision of the Income Tax Clerk or any part thereof and shall issue
a written decision within ninety days after the Board's final hearing on the
appeal, which shall be sent by ordinary mail to the petitioner within fifteen
days after issuing the decision. Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or
decision of the Board of Tax Review may appeal therefrom in accordance with
Revised Code Section 5717.011.

or if the employer elects to withhold taxes; or, if the employee's employer
withholds and remits tax on the qualifying wages to the municipal corporation
in which the employee's principal place of work is situated, or, the employee's
employer withholds and remits tax on the qualifying wages to the municipal
corporation in which the employer's fixed location is located, and the employee

181.14 REFUNDS.
   (a)    Should it appear that any taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the Village of New London is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided a
proper claim for refund of such overpayment of tax has been filed by the
taxpayer, or same may be applied toward the declaration of tax due for the

obtainable from the income Tax Clerk. The Income Tax Clerk may require the

   (e)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
shall be considered to have been filed in a timely manner if any of the

      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.

was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (f)    Interest at the Applicable Interest Rate shall be allowed and paid on
any overpayment by a taxpayer of any municipal income tax obligation from the
date of the overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except
that if any overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing
date of the annual return or ninety days after the completed return is filed,
whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose
of computing the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for
any taxable year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which
the return on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension
of time for filing that return.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.15 ANNUAL RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    (1)   Effective January 1, 1997, each individual taxpayer eighteen
years of age or older whose earnings or profits are subject to the tax imposed
by this chapter shall, whether or not tax is due but, subject to paragraph (b)
following, on or before April 15th of each year make and file a return with the
Income Tax Clerk on a form furnished by or obtainable from the Income Tax Clerk
setting forth the aggregate amount of salary, wages or other compensation and
net profits earned by him during the preceding year and subject to the tax,
together with other pertinent information as the Income Tax Clerk may require.
However, when the final return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be made within 105 days from
the end of such fiscal year or other period whether or not a tax is due
thereon. The tax due shall be computed on the return and the taxpayer shall pay
the tax due at the time of filing. No remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less. A person may round to the nearest whole
dollar all amounts the person is required to enter on any return, report,
voucher, or other document required under this chapter. Any fractional part of
a dollar that equals or exceeds fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole
dollar, and any fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall
be dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the
person shall round all amounts entered on the document. Such return shall be
deemed filed when postmarked by the United States Post Office or delivered
during normal business hours to the Tax office. Notwithstanding any filing
deadlines prescribed by this section, an annual income tax return or report due
to the Village may be filed within the time prescribed in the federal income
tax code for the corresponding tax reporting period, or on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the Revised Code, if such period is later than the
time allowed in this section.
      (2)   (A)   A person may notify the tax clerk that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village of New London income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with New London
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location within New London.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in New London and
does not expect to be subject to New London income tax for the taxable year.
         (B)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within New London. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within New London, make any sales in New London, or otherwise become subject to
the tax levied by New London during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by New London for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with the New London income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (C)   If a person submits such an affidavit, the Tax Clerk shall not
require the person to file a tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax
Clerk possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the
circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (D)   Nothing in of this section prohibits the Tax Clerk from
performing an audit of the person.
   (b)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent. If
an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice required, the
return or notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by
the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person charged with the care of the person or property of that
individual. Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Spouses may file a
joint return.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each annual net profit
return required to be filed under this chapter by a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Clerk on or
before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Clerk or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Village of New London. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
   (d)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall contain the
signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent and of the
person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include the
taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury. Each return
required to be filed shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to
authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the tax administrator about matters pertaining to
the return. The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate
that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the tax administrator to
contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the
examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other
person only to provide the tax administrator with information that is missing
from the return, to contact the tax administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's
refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the tax
administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person. When income tax
returns, reports, or other documents require the signature of a tax return
preparer, a facsimile of such a signature shall be acceptable in lieu of a
manual signature.
   (e)   The Income Tax clerk may require a taxpayer who is an individual to
include, with each annual return, amended return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: all of the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements,"
including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as
taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal corporation; the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040, or, in the case of a return or
request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form IT-1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the tax administrator unless the tax administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed. The Income Tax Clerk may
require a taxpayer that is not an individual to include, with each annual net
profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund required under
this section, copies of only the following documents: the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or
form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files
an annual net profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or
in some other manner shall either mail the documents required under this
division to the tax administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic
submission is available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio
business gateway. After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Income Tax Clerk may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipal corporation to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability.
   (f)    The return of an employer or employers showing the amount of tax
deducted by such employer or employers from the salaries, wages, or
compensation of any employee and paid by him or them to the Income Tax Clerk,
shall be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income
subject to the tax is such salary, wages or compensation.
   (g)    (1)   Extension of time for filing returns. Any taxpayer that has
duly requested an automatic six-month extension for filing the taxpayer's
federal income tax return shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or
after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of New London’s income tax return
for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An
extension of time to file under this division is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due unless the tax administrator grants an extension of that
date. A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with the filing
of the Village of New London income tax return.
(2)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
(3)   A member of the national guard of any state, or of a reserve component of
the armed forces of the United States called to active duty, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the income tax clerk for both an
extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment
of taxes pursuant to the provisions of Revised Code Section 718.052.
(4)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension for
filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a written request
that the tax administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date
for filing the taxpayer's Village of New London income tax return. If the
request is received by the tax administrator on or before the date the Village
of New London income tax return is due, the tax administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under this section, the tax administrator shall not make any
inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or
before the date the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due
date to file the return, whichever occurs first. If a tax administrator
violates of this restriction, the Village shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
This restriction does not apply to an extension received if the tax
administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a
federal extension as required to receive the applicable extension or failed to
file for an extension under of this section.
   (h)    "Pass-through entities" (e.g., partnerships, limited liability
companies and S corporations) as that term is defined in Ohio R.C. 718.01, must
file an annual return and shall pay the applicable tax on the income of the
pass-through entity in the hands of that entity, and the same income shall not
be taxed, nor a return filed, for said income in the hands of the owners of the
entity.
   (i)    If a taxpayer operates a business (including rentals or leasing)
which sustains a net operating loss during the taxable year and has no other
source of business income which is subject to the tax, the net operating loss
may be carried forward for a period of up to five consecutive years subsequent
to the year of the loss to be used against future profits generated by a
business; but such net operating business losses shall not be deducted from any
individual's "qualifying wages" or nonbusiness income under any circumstances.
   (j)    Subject to subsection (i), if a taxpayer has multiple sources of
income subject to the tax, he or she may combine the sources of income to
arrive at the income subject to New London income tax. This includes income
from husbands and wives which may be combined to arrive at the income subject
to New London income tax.
   (k)    In lieu of the forms adopted by the Income Tax Clerk as provided in
paragraph (a) above, a taxpayer may file a generic form of any return, report,
or other document if the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all
of the information required to be submitted in the standard form prescribed by
the Income Tax Clerk, so long as the taxpayer complies with the rules or
ordinances of the Village governing the filing of returns, reports, or other
documents.
   (l)    At the election of the taxpayer, the Village of New London shall
accept for filing a consolidated income tax return from any affiliated group of
corporations subject to the Village's tax if that affiliated group filed for
the same tax reporting period a consolidation return for Federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code; the rules,
conditions or eligibility, time constraints, and calculations prescribed in
Revised Code 718.06 shall govern any such consolidated returns.
   (m)    The Village will accept a return, an estimated return, and payments
of tax, which have been properly submitted in accordance with the Ohio Business
Gateway or in any other manner prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, as if filed
with the Village.
   (n)    A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Income Tax Clerk if
any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return to determine the tax due levied by the Village must be
altered as the result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and
such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax liability under this chapter. If a
taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return,
or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return,
based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer
shall notify the Income Tax Clerk before filing the amended return.
(Ord. 2023-22. Passed 11-13-23.)
181.16 CONTRACTOR COMPLIANCE.
   No building permit shall be issued by the Village and no building or fixture
construction or repair work shall be undertaken within the Village, including
but not limited to plumbing, sewer, heating, electrical, water proofing,
siding, roofing, blacktop, landscaping, lawn maintenance, tree work and any
other work relating to real estate, building or fixture construction or repair,
until the contractor and/or sub-contractor, has first registered his name,
address, Social Security number, E.I.N. and principal place of business with
the Village Income Tax Department and obtained a Certificate of Registration
from said Department.
   (a)    In the case where a sub-contractor's name is unknown at the time of
initial registration of the contractor, such registration shall be permitted
and thereafter, within five days for obtaining such information, the contractor
and subcontractor shall each register with the Village Income Tax Department.
   (b)    Failure of the contractor to provide registration information as
provided above shall result in the revocation of any registration and
certificate previously issued. Revocation shall also occur in the event of
failure to file tax return, including withholding returns, failure to withhold
and/or pay any taxes, interest or penalties owed to the Village, failure to be
current in the obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties owed to the
Village, or for other good cause articulated by the Income Tax Department.
Otherwise, said registration of the change in any relevant information as set
forth herein to be declared, or the same shall be revoked, subject to re-
registration in compliance with this section.
   (c)    Any fees for the above shall be set by the Tax Department and shall
bear a reasonable relation to the work and/or forms expense involved in such
registration and issuing of said certificate.
   (d)   In cases of transient and/or temporary work being done in the Village,
persons, firms, partnership or corporations performing the same shall be
subject to registration, but the Tax Department is authorized to charge a
reasonable blanket amount to said contractor and/or subcontractor to cover
registration fees and any taxes likely to be incurred for said work being done
in the Village. However, this shall not include the responsibility and
liability for employees' withholding taxes, which still shall be required under
this chapter, unless the same has specifically been included. If said taxpayer
does not wish to pay said blanket amount, suggested by the Tax Department, said
taxpayer shall be charged the registration fee as set forth herein and be
responsible for filing all returns and paying all taxes, penalties and interest
under this chapter.

Passed 6-8-20.)
181.18 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING BY EMPLOYER.
   (a)    It is required of each employer within the Village of New London (as
defined in Section
181.01(f)) who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or
other compensation basis, to deduct from compensation paid to such employee
subject to this chapter at the time of such payment, the tax imposed in Section
181.02 on such salary, wage, bonus, incentive payment, commission or other
compensation due by said employer to said employee.
   (b)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, when, an
employer within the Village of New London employs a Village of New London
resident in another taxing municipality which requires the employer to deduct
the tax from such taxing municipality from the New London resident employed
there, such employer shall withhold and remit to the Village of New London the
difference, if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing municipality
and the tax imposed by this chapter or shall withhold New London tax on one
hundred percent (100%) of the income subject to New London tax if the New
London resident/employee is employed in a location which does not impose
municipal tax.
(Ord. 2017-29. Passed 11-27-17.)
   (c)   (1)   Each employer shall make and file a withholding tax return with
the Income Tax Clerk and pay to the Income Tax Clerk the taxes deducted and
withheld on the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each calendar
quarter, i.e., April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the total taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer on behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar
year exceeded two thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total
amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld
on behalf of the municipal corporation in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded two hundred dollars, Taxes required to be deducted and
withheld shall be remitted monthly to the tax administrator. Payment shall be
made to the tax administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.
         (Ord. 2020-12. Passed 6-8-20.)
   (d)    Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by and obtainable
from the Income Tax Clerk and shall be deemed filed when postmarked by the
United States Post Office or delivered to the Tax office during normal business
hours. Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same
as Trustee for the benefit of the City until payment is made by such employer
to the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his employees
shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands
of such employer.
   (e)    The officer or employee having control or supervision or charged with
the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment, shall be
personally liable for failure to file the return and making the payment, or pay
the taxes, penalty and interest due as required herein. The dissolution,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an
officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file
a return or pay taxes and penalty and interest due.
   (f)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Income Tax Clerk listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipal corporation during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax
withheld, if any, from each such employee, the total amount of qualifying wages
paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of every
other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have been
withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Income Tax Clerk. At the time
of filing this return, the employer shall pay over any amount deducted or which
should have been deducted or withheld during the preceding year but which was
not remitted.
   (g)    All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish forms 1099 to IRS for
individuals or businesses to whom or which they have paid nonemployee
compensation, shall furnish copies of the said form 1099s to the Income Tax
Clerk or in lieu thereof, a listing containing the same information as required
by IRS on the 1099s on or before the due date for such forms 1099 as
established by IRS. Failure to provide the foregoing information will result in
any deduction for payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's tax return to
be disallowed.
      (1)    The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Village bears to the total number of
working days employed within and outside the Village.
      (2)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (3)    The occasional entry into the Village of a nonresident employee
who performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the Village,
but enters the Village for the purpose of reporting, receiving instructions,
accounting, etc., incidental to his duties outside the Village, shall not be
deemed to take such employee out of the class of those rendering their service
entirely outside the Village.
   (h)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of New
London income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
   (i)   The tax clerk shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at the
request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required to be withheld
by this ordinance, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section
   (j) An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advance
made to an employee on account of commissions where such advances are in excess
of commissions earned.
   (k) An employer, required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided, that such expense must be of the kind and in the amount
recognized and allowed as deductible expense for Federal income tax purposes.
   (l)    The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received. However, if the tax has been withheld but has not been
paid over to the Village, the employee is relieved of responsibility to the
extent of the taxes withheld, unless the employee colluded with the employer in
connection with the failure to remit payment.
   (m)    Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers, and others
who are independent contractors and not employees of the payor, are not subject
to withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in
all instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of
Section
181.02.
   (n)    The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the
Village, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall not
relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with this
chapter respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes.
   (o)    The requirements of this section shall apply to any nonresident
employer, or to the agent of such a nonresident employer, or to any other
nonresident payer, who pays an individual any item included in the taxable
income of that individual employee or payee, if the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld for the Village on account of all of the
employer's employees or payer's payees exceeds one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00) for the calendar year.
   (p)   For tax years 2004 and thereafter, the obligations to withhold taxes
described herein shall extend only to qualifying wages as defined in this
chapter.
(Ord. 2017-29. Passed 11-27-17.)
181.18.1 COLLECTION AT SOURCE: LANDLORD PROVISIONS.
   Every owner of one or more rental units is hereby directed to furnish to the
Income Tax Administrator, a semi-annual roster of the names of all persons
considered by that owner to be the tenant and/or lessee in such rental unit and
shall also file a statement of any changes in the roster at the end of each
month. The semi-annual statement provided for herein shall be filed with the
Income Tax Clerk on or before the thirty-first day of January and the thirty-
first day of July, unless an extension of time is granted by the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.18.2 COLLECTION AT SOURCE: WINNINGS FROM CASINO, SPORTS GAMING FACILITY OR
VIDEO LOTTERY TERMINAL.
   (a)   Each casino facility or casino operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9)
of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code,
respectively, each lottery sales agent conducting video lottery terminals on
behalf of the state (including but not limited to video lottery terminals for
lottery sports gaming, as defined in Section 3770.23 of the Ohio Revised Code),
and each Type B sports gaming proprietor offering sports gaming at a sports
gaming facility, as those terms are defined in Section 3775.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, is hereby required to report, withhold, and remit municipal
income tax to the Income Tax Clerk, with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages, as provided in Section 718.031 of the Ohio Revised Code and
subject to the procedures, requirements, and penalties stated therein. Amounts
deducted and withheld by a casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or
sports gaming proprietor are held in trust for the benefit of the municipal
corporation to which the tax is owed.
   (b)   A casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports gaming
proprietor that fails to file a required return and remit the amounts required
to be deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld
and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
   (c)   If a casino operator or sports gaming proprietor sells the casino
facility or sports gaming facility, or otherwise quits the casino or sports
gaming business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. If a video lottery sales
agent ceases to operate video lottery terminals, the amounts deducted and
withheld along with any penalties or interest thereon are immediately due and
payable. The successor of any such entity shall withhold an amount of the
purchase money that is sufficient to cover the amounts deducted and withheld
along with any penalties and interest thereon until the precedessor casino
operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports gaming proprietor produces
either of the following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (d)   The failure of a casino operator, video lottery sales agent, or sports
gaming proprietor to deduct and withhold the required amount from a person’s
winnings does not relieve that person from liability for the Municipal income
tax with respect to those winnings.
   (e)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator, or by a video lottery sales
agent, or by a Type B sports gaming proprietor under Section 718.031 of the
Ohio Revised Code are deemed to be paid to the Municipal corporation for which
the taxes were withheld on the date the taxes are withheld from the taxpayer’s
winnings. Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 718.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. This division applies only to the
person for whom the amount is deducted and withheld.
(Ord. 2022-23. Passed 7-11-22.)
181.19 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    An employee whose entire wages, salaries or other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
181.18 and whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to this entire earnings
for such year by his employer, and who during such taxable year expects to
derive no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax under this
chapter, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
 
   (b)    All other taxpayers, as defined in this chapter subject to the taxes

the beginning of each such fiscal year. Those taxpayers on a fiscal year basis
shall make payments as follows
 
22½%by the 15th day of the fourth month of the taxpayer's taxable year;
45%  by the 15th day of the sixth month;
67½%by the 15th day of the ninth month; and
90%  by the 15th day of the 12th month.
 
   (d)    The estimated tax for calendar year taxpayers may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration or in installments as follows:

     beginning of the taxable year;
90%  on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable
     year.
   (e)    The declarations so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by
or obtainable from the Clerk-Treasurer. Any taxpayer who has filed an estimate
for Federal Income Tax purposes may, in making the declaration required
hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are the same
figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his estimate for the
Federal Income Tax. However, in addition to such statement, any such taxpayer
may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as to
exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under this chapter.
   (f)    Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with subsection (g) hereof.
   (g)    If any such taxpayer shall, on or before any of the installment
payment dates specified herein, file an amended declaration showing an increase
or decrease of the estimated tax, the installments then and thereafter due
shall be increased or diminished (as the case may be) in such manner that the
balance of the estimated tax shall be fully paid on or before the last date of
payment for the taxable year.
   (h)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability shall be deemed due
to reasonable cause and no penalty shall be added to the taxes for the taxable
year if any of the following apply:

ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipal
corporation but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (i)   The Income Tax Clerk may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
(Ord. 2017-29. Passed 11-27-17.)
181.20 RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYER.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under this chapter are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns,
whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes payable upon earnings or net
profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to enable the Fiscal
Officer, or any agent or employee of the Fiscal Officer, to verify the
correctness of the returns filed.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.21 INCOME TAX FUND.
   The Fiscal Officer shall cause to be created a separate fund to be known as
the Income Tax Fund, into which receipts of Village Income Tax shall be
deposited.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.22 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; CIVIL LITIGATION; CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)    All taxes imposed by this chapter remaining unpaid when the same have
become due, together with all interest and penalties therefor, become a debt
due the Village from the taxpayer, and are recoverable as other debts by suit
instituted by the Village Solicitor.
   (b)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and
interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the later of:
      (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; provided, however, that this time limit may be extended at
any time if both the Income Tax Clerk and the employer, agent of the employer,
other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension; or
      (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral period,
if any. "Qualifying deferral period" means a period of time beginning and
ending as follows:
         (A)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files an appeal with a local board of tax review. That date shall
not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding by any
administrative body or court that the local board of tax review with which the
aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to affirm,
reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         (B)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the local board of tax review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the local board of tax review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the local board
of tax review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either the period during which a taxpayer has
a right to appeal the imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties, or
the period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that tax or
interest or those penalties is pending.
   (b)    Civil actions to recover City tax, interest and penalties on City tax
shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later.
   (c)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter shall
be commenced within three years after the commission of the offense, provided
that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the income required to be reported, prosecutions
may be commenced within six years after the commission of the offense.
   (d)    Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
   (e)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipal corporation does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the tax administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the local board of tax review created
under section 718.11 of the Revised Code, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or
any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been
appealed, so that the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected
assessment is less than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant
or to the appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment, with interest on that amount at the Stated Interest Rate.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.23 IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED.
   Agents and employees charged with the duty of inspection or auditing of
records of employers and taxpayers will carry proper identification which shall
be subject to examination by any person whose records are sought to be
examined.
(Ord. 2015-18. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.24 SAVINGS CLAUSE; COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW.
   (a)    If any provision, sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter
is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality,
illegality or invalidity shall affect only that particular sentence, clause,
section or part of this chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the
remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other parts of this
chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of Council that this chapter
would have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid
provision, sentence, clause, section or part thereof had not been included
herein.
   (b)    This chapter, all subsequent tax ordinances and all preceding tax
ordinances, including all amendments thereto, shall continue to be effective
insofar as the collection of taxes levied thereunder until all said taxes and
all penalties and interest thereon are fully paid, and any and all suits and
prosecutions for the collection of said taxes, penalties and interest, or for
the punishment or violation of said ordinances shall have been fully
terminated.
   (c)   The intention of the Council of the Village of New London is that this
Chapter
181 of the Codified Ordinances shall be in full compliance with the provisions
and express limitations of Revised Code Chapter 718; the Village of New London
is levying this income tax in accordance with the limitations specified in

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the

to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
 
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   (b)   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property;
except that such person having such permission shall conceal, by means of
buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open. (A.O.)
   (c)   Council, Board of Township Trustees, the Chief of Police or the
Municipal or Township Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail with
return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of
the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property. Personal service of notice to remove junk or abandoned vehicles upon
the property owner shall be acceptable and be deemed equivalent to notice by
certified mail.
   (d)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the
open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent day that a junk
motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate minor misdemeanor
offense. (Ord. 95-29. Passed 1-2-96.)
   (e)   Although a Demolition Derby vehicle is an Unlicensed Junk Vehicle, it
shall be permissible to have one such vehicle on property within the Village
during the period of June 15th to September 15th, provided that:
      (1)   Obtain a permit from the Village office at a cost of $10.00.
      (2)   Put the permit on the car in a conspicuous place.
      (3)   Permit is only good from June 15 to September 15. After which time
the car must be removed from the property or it will be considered a junk
vehicle and be subject to all laws of the Village of New London.
         (Ord. 94-13. Passed 8-16-94.)
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.

303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43 .
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection

   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains

   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.

(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor

substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
    “It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)   
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty

organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)
541.02 ARSON.
   (a)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause or
create a substantial risk of physical harm to any property of another without
the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm
to any property of another without his consent:
      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor if the property involved is not an aircraft, an
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part or any other equipment or
implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an aircraft and if
the violation does not create a risk of physical harm to any person, and if the
property involved is not an occupied aircraft. A violation of this section is a
misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section creates a risk
of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering is a
misdemeanor of the first degree. (ORC 2909.06)

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
 
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,

worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

will be taken monthly, normally on or about the 20th of each month or as close
thereto as is practical.
   (e)   If the meter reader is unable to obtain a reading by reason of the
meter being out of order, it will be replaced and an estimated charge will be
made. If the meter reader is unable to gain entrance to the premises on a
second call, the current bill be estimated. Estimates will be based on the two
previous readings. Water consumption will not be estimated two monthly billing
periods in succession. Water service will be shut off if meter reader cannot
gain entrance after proper notification.
   (f)   Meters shall remain the property of the Village of New London and the

have his service discontinued.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 8-28-17.)
921.03 LIABILITY.
   The water department does not guarantee any fixed pressure or continuous
supply, but it will, in case of any emergency or accident that will cause a
shortage, or water to be shut off, endeavor to notify consumers affected
thereby. Those using steam boilers and receiving their supply directly from the
Village mains should have a storage tank of sufficient gallonage to hold an
ample supply for any emergency, as no claims will be considered for damage of
any nature whatsoever arising from such action.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 8-28-17.)
921.04 MULTIPLE OCCUPANCY BUILDINGS.

fee must be paid in advance to the Fiscal Officer. The Village will provide a
meter and two couplings. Installation of the meter is to be done according to
Village specifications by the homeowner. After installation the Village will
make an inspection and hook up the remote where applicable. At all times, the
pool meter shall be and remain the property of the Village.
   (c)    Pool meters will be read monthly. There will be no estimated bills.
Charges will be based on actual usage to service a swimming pool and will be
payable monthly. The first 2,000 gallons/month will be charged at the existing
water rates, prorated per 1,000 gallons of water used. Any additional usage
will be billed at existing rates. There will be no sewer charges for water
running through pool meters which water is being used exclusively to service a

plant. Applicable industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial
pretreatment regulations, as promulgated under Section 307(b) of the Clean
Water Act and included in 40 CFR Part 403, are hereby incorporated in this
chapter and made a part thereof.
   (b)   An industry must, upon application for sewer service, present to the
Village a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be discharged to
sewerage system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is not available, the
expected waste analysis based on similar processes now in operation. New
industries or industries with significant increases in discharge volume or
strength must submit information on wastewater characteristics and obtain prior
approval from the Village before discharging to the sanitary sewer system.
   (c)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it will
damage the sewage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the wastewater
treatment plant, the Village shall compel such users to dispose of such waste
and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (d)   In cases where the character of the sewage or industrial waste from
any manufacturing or industrial plant, building, or premises is such that it
imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage collection, pumping, or
treatment works greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering the
sewerage system, the Village may: compel such manufacturing or industrial
plant, building, or premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as
specified by the Village before discharging it into the sewerage system;
require flow control or equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any "slug"
loads or excessive loads that may be harmful to the treatment works; or require
payment of a surcharge on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the
treatment works to cover the additional costs of having capacity for and
treating such wastes.
   (e)   The discharge of nonacceptable industrial wastewater into the sewerage
system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater shall be
deemed nonacceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic substances in
the wastewater exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic or harmful
substances include those pollutants subject to the Clean Water Act and defined
in Section 307(a). Limits on toxic or harmful substances of this ordinance are

his own cost and expense a control manhole and suitable monitoring equipment to
be used for the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected.
   (d)   The control manhole and monitoring equipment shall be located and
maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such
a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the
Village may allow such a facility to be constructed in the public right-of-way,
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of such right-of-
way, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping, or parked vehicles.
   (e)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the Village
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Village
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each
discharge.
   (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Village requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (g)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section

composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a 24 hour
period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined necessary by the
Village in order to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
   (h)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standards Methods",
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste", published by the U.S. EPA,
or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis",
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. Analysis of those
pollutants not covered by these publications shall be performed in accordance
with procedures established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA). In addition, all measurements, test, and analysis of the characteristics
of wastewater shall also be made in conformance with the October 16, 1975
Federal Register (40 CFR Part 136) entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test
Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants".
   (i)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination, with respect to the prohibitions and limitations stated in
Section
925.02, will be done at such intervals as designated by the Village.
   (j)   Duly authorized employees of the Village bearing proper credentials
and identifications shall be permitted to enter all properties for the purpose
of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, and testing pertinent to
discharge to the community system in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter.
   (k)   Duly authorized Village employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial process which have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. The industry may
withhold information considered confidential provided that the industry
establishes that revealing such information to the public might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   
   (l)   While performing necessary work for private properties, referred to in
subsection (j), the Village or duly authorized employees of the Village shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 8-28-17.)

   (a)   Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter.
Facilities to prevent accidental discharge or prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Village from review, and shall be approved
by the Village before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such
plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify his facility as necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
   (b)   If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable
to comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Village so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system. In addition, a
written report addressed to the Village detailing the date, time, and cause of
the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge;
and corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by the
responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 2017-12. Passed 8-28-17.)

the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
   (d)    Suspicious Personal Identifying Information. The following may also
be potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)    Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the Village. For example;
         A.   The address does not match any address in the consumer report;

on the Social Security Administrations Death Master File; or
      (2)   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not
consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN age and
date of birth.
      (3)    Personal identifying information provided is associated with known
fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the
Village. For example, the address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application.

associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party
sources used by the Village. For example:
      A.   The address on an application is fictitious, a mail drop, or a

      B.   The phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or
answering service.
      C.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other persons
opening an account or other customers.
      D.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or similar
to the address or telephone number submitted by an unusually large number of
other customers or other persons opening accounts.
      (5)    The customer or the person opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application or in
response to notification that the application is incomplete.
      (6)    Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal identifying information that is on file with the Village.
      (7)    When using security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s name,
etc.), authenticating information beyond that which generally would be
available from a wallet or consumer report.
   (e)    Unusual Use Of, or Suspicious Activity Related To, the Covered
Account. The following may also be potential indicators of fraud:
      (1)    Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a covered
account, the Village receives a request for new, additional, or replacement
goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
      (2)    A new revolving credit account is used in a manner commonly
associated with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent
payments.
      (3)    A covered account is used in a manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on the account. There is, for example:
Nonpayment when there is no history of late or missed payments; a material
change in purchasing or usage patterns.
      (4)    A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably lengthy
period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account, the
expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
      (5)    Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable
although transactions continue to be conducted in connection with the
customer’s covered account.
      (6)    The Village is notified that the customer is not receiving paper
account statements.
      (7)    The Village is notified of unauthorized charges or transactions in

      (9)    The Village is notified by a customer, a victim of identity theft,
a law enforcement authority or any other person that it has opened a fraudulent
account for a person engaged in identity theft.
         (Ord. 08-23. Passed 10-24-08.)
929.06 RESPONDING TO RED FLAGS.
   (a)    Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all related
documentation and write a description of the situation. Present this
information to the designated authority for determination.
   (b)   The designated authority will complete additional authentication to
determine whether the attempted transaction was fraudulent or authentic.
   (c)   If a transaction is determined to be fraudulent, appropriate actions
must be taken immediately. Actions may include:
      (1)    Canceling the transaction;
      (2)    Notifying a cooperating with appropriate law enforcement;
      (3)    Determining the extent of liability of the Village; and

responsibility of the governing body.
   (b)    Operational responsibility of the program is delegated to the Village
Administrator.
   (c)    Staff training shall be conducted for all employees, officials and
contractors for whom it is reasonably foreseeable that they may come into

constitute a risk to the Village or its customers. The Clerk- Treasurer is
responsible for ensuring identity theft training for all requisite employees
and contractors.
   (d)    Employees must receive annual training in all elements of this
policy.
   (e)    It is the responsibility of the Village to ensure that the activities
of all service providers are conducted in accordance with reasonable policies
and procedure designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity
theft. A service provider that maintains it own identity theft prevention
program, consistent with the guidance of the red flag rules and validated by
appropriate due diligence, may be considered to be meeting these requirements.
Any specific requirements should be specifically addressed in the appropriate
contract arrangements.

CHAPTER 931
Storm Water Drainage Utility
931.01    Establishment.
931.02    Charges.
931.03    Rate reductions.
931.04    Appeals.
 
931.01 ESTABLISHMENT.
   (a)    It is hereby declared to be in the best interests of the Village of
New London to form a structure and procedures designed to better manage storm
water and provide for storm drainage improvements, thus reducing combined sewer
overflows, recognizing that all real property within the Village will benefit
from the installation of an adequate storm drainage system, and that the cost
of such a system should, therefore, be assessed against such property.
   (b)    There is hereby established in the Village of New London a storm
water drainage utility, the Village hereby declaring its intention to acquire,
own, construct, equip, operate, and maintain open drainage ways, underground
drains, equipment and appurtenances necessary, useful, or convenient for a
complete storm water drainage system, including the maintenance, extension,
construction, reconstruction and improvement of the present storm drainage
system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the improvement of both public and
private storm drainage facilities through or immediately adjacent to a new
development shall remain the responsibility of the developer. Further, nothing
in this chapter is intended or shall be construed to create any obligation for
the Village to maintain any drainage ways within property not owned by the
Village or to alter the legal obligations of private property owners.
   (c)   The Village Administrator shall manage, conduct, and control the Storm
Water Drainage Utility, and is authorized to develop and adopt plans, policies,
and regulations necessary or desirable for the regulation and operation of said
utility.
   (d)    No portion of this chapter or any statement herein or subsequent
Council interpretation or policies shall relieve a property owner of
assessments otherwise authorized by law and levied against his property for any
public facility improvements projects.
(Ord. 05-02. Passed 4-5-05.)
931.02 CHARGES.
   (a)   There is hereby levied and imposed upon all premises which have been
improved within the Village of New London just and equitable charges for storm
drainage service, or subsequent service, construction, reconstruction,
maintenance, operation, and extension and a Storm Water Drainage Fund is
established for the foregoing purposes.
   (b)   Said charges shall be collected with monthly water bill of water
users, billed with sanitary sewer for those connected to sewer alone, or billed
alone as a storm water drainage charge for those users not connected to and/or
not charged for Village water and /or sanitary sewer.
   (c)   Said charges shall be paid monthly by those liable therefore, and
placed in a Storm Water Drainage Fund to be used only for the purposes provided
in this chapter.
   (d)   It is hereby determined that property is furnished service
approximately in proportion to the amount of the property’s impervious surface;
and therefore, the Council hereby establishes the following property use
classifications and rates for charges for this service:
 
Residential Use Property       $5.73 per month
Commercial Use Property       $18.35 per month
School Use Property          $35.57 per month
Trailer Park Use Property    $35.57 per month
Apartment Use Property    $35.57 per month
(ten or more suites operated on
the same or adjacent properties under
common ownership
Industrial Use Property         $47.05 per month
   No charge shall be assessed against undeveloped property.
   In the event that there is any question as to the appropriate use
classification and charge to be assessed against a property, the Village
Administrator shall establish the same, based on the closest approximation of
the amount of impervious surface for the property in question compared with the
existing use classifications. In no event shall a property be assessed at less
than the Residential Use Rate. (Ord. 2022-12. Passed 4-25-22.)
   (e)   Rates shall be set by action of the Village Council. It is the
Council’s intention that rates shall be established so that in no year shall
the operating fund of the utility show a loss.
   (f)   The Owner of any property subject to a charge provided herein shall
pay the same, when due, to the Village of New London. Bills that are not paid
within fifteen days of the invoice shall be subject to an additional delayed
payment charge of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the bill. If any charges
due are not paid when due, the Solicitor shall collect them by actions at law
in the name of the Village, or they may be certified to the County Auditor for
placement on the tax list and duplicate as a lien against the property served.
(Ord. 2023-19. Passed 9-25-23.)
931.03 RATE REDUCTIONS.
   The established rates for charges established in this chapter may be reduced
for nonresidential property, upon application of the property owner, in cases
where runoff control measures approved by the Village Administrator have been
implemented. Review and analysis of such measures shall be handled on an
individual case-by-case basis; and the decision as to the amount of reduction
applicable shall be made by the Administrator. The maximum rate of reduction
shall be fifty percent (50%) of established rate and shall never be less than
the amount which would be assessed for a residential property.
(Ord. 05-02. Passed 4-5-05.)
931.04 APPEALS.
   Any person who is adversely affected by any decision of the Village
Administrator in connection with the application or enforcement of this
chapter, including requests for rate reductions under Section
931.03 may appeal to the Village Council. Any appeal request must be in writing
and shall state the specific decision being appealed, the alleged error or
grounds for appeal, and shall state the relief to which the applicant believes
he is entitled. The decision of the Council shall be deemed final. Appeal
requests must be filed with the Clerk-Treasurer within thirty days of the
decision being appealed.

1104.05 MEETINGS.
   For purposes of hearing matters described in this chapter the Zoning
Commission shall meet at times prior to and coinciding with Village Council
meetings with a ten day public notice. Other meetings may be convened at the
call of the Zoning Commissioner, its Chairman or two other members. The person
(s) requesting the meeting may request the Fiscal Officer to coordinate the
scheduling thereof, give notice of the meeting, and publish or distribute any
notices legally required. The Village Solicitor and Zoning Commissioner shall
attend a meeting of the Board if requested to do so.
(Ord. 2016-08. Passed 8-22-16.)
1104.06 WITNESSES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals chairman, acting chairman or Village Solicitor
may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses in any matter
coming within the review of this Zoning Ordinance.
(a)   Attendance of Applicant Required. An applicant, the applicant's attorney,
or agent of the applicant shall attend the meeting. The Board will dismiss,
without hearing, an application if the applicant, his attorney, or his agent
does not attend. If the applicant, his attorney or agent is not in attendance,
the Board may move to consider the case in those circumstances where a
dismissal without hearing would constitute a hardship for the surrounding
property owners or other interested individuals.
      (Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1104.07 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   Appeals shall be heard and decided where it is alleged there is error
in any order, requirements, decision or determination made by the Zoning
Commissioner in the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Appeals may be taken by any person, firm or corporation, or by any
officer or board of the Village of New London, deeming himself or those to be
adversely effected by the decision of the Zoning Commissioner respecting the
interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance. Appeal shall be made no later than
twenty calendar days after the date of the grievance.
   
   (c)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Commissioner, whose decision is being
appealed, shall certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of
appeal has been filed, that by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a
stay would, in his opinion, cause "imminent" peril to life or property. In such
case, proceeding shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order granted
by the Board of Appeals or by a Court having lawful jurisdiction.
   (d)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific
cases, such variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands,
structure, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (e)   Except as otherwise permitted in this Zoning Ordinance, no variance in
the strict application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be
granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless the Board shall find that the
written application for the requested variance contains all of the following
requirements:
(1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s);
(2)   Legal description of property;
(3)   Description or nature of variance requested;
(4)   A fee as established by ordinance;
(5)   Narrative statements establishing and substantiating that the variance
conforms to the following standards:
A.   The granting of the variance shall be in accord with the general purpose
and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Ordinance on the district
in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
B.   The granting of the variance will not permit the establishment of any use
which is not otherwise permitted in the district.
C.   There must exist special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is
sought which are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally
to land or buildings in the area, and which are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. Mere loss in value
shall not justify a variance; there must be deprivation of beneficial use of
land.
D.   There must be proof of hardship created by the strict application of this
Zoning Ordinance. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater
profit would result in the variance were granted. Furthermore, the hardship
complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on this basis
by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions; it must
result from the application of this Zoning Ordinance; it must be suffered
directly by the property in question; and evidence of variances granted under
similar circumstances need not be considered.
E.   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the
land or building, and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
F.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air
to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public
street, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
G.   The granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant
any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (f)   In addition the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit such modification
as may be necessary to secure the appropriate improvement of a parcel of land
that is too small to be appropriately improved without such modification
provided the parcel was separately owned at the time of passage of this Zoning
Ordinance or is adjacent to buildings that do not conform to the general
restrictions applicable to their location. Requirements of subsection (e)(5)A.
to C. must be applied.
   (g)   In granting variances, exceptions or conditional uses, the Board may
impose such conditions as it may deem necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare and to further the purpose and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance. Those conditions shall be made a part of and be attached to the
required Zoning Permit.
   (h)   The Board shall hear and determine all conditional use applications
which possess unique or special characteristics relating to location, design,
size, traffic generation and methods of operation, except for Industrial
Districts which are provided for in Chapters
1114 and
1115. Conditional uses although often desirable, will more intensely affect the
surrounding area in which they are located, than the permitted uses of such
districts. Since this is the case, the Board shall approve an application for a
Conditional Use only when the following conditions are met:
(1)   The Conditional Use is in general accord with the New London Village
Comprehensive Zoning Plan.
(2)   The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing land use
character and physical development potential of the area and will not be of
substantial detriment to the public interest, to the property, to other
property values or improvements.
(3)   If necessary, to accommodate certain projects, special conditions may
require a greater amount of open space, entrance or exit drives, special
lighting, noise control requirements, and fencing and landscaping.
         (Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)

granted as guided by the following:
(1)   To permit any yard or setback less than yard or setback required by the
applicable regulations.
(2)   To permit the use of a lot or lots for a use otherwise prohibited solely
because of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots, but generally the
respective area and width of the lot or lots should not be less than eighty
percent (80%) of the required area and width.

(6)   To increase the maximum distance that required parking spaces are
permitted to be located from the use served, but generally not more than forty
percent (40%).
(7)   To increase the maximum allowable size or area of signs on a lot, but

1104.09 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or by layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance. In case of any questions as to the location
of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of
the Zoning District may be made to the Board of Zoning Appeals and a
determination shall be made by said Board.
(Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1104.10 PROCEDURES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS; SUBSTANIALLY
SIMILAR USES; ACCESSORY USES.
      (a)   Regulation of Conditional Uses. The provisions of subsections (a)
to (j) inclusive of this Zoning Ordinance apply to the location and maintenance
of any and all conditional uses.
   (b)   Purpose. In recent years, the characteristics and impacts of an ever-
increasing number of new and unique uses, together with the broadening of
numerous conventional uses, have fostered the development of more flexible
regulations designed to accommodate these activities in a reasonable and
equitable manner, while safeguarding both the property rights of all
individuals and the health, safety, and general welfare of the community.
Towards these ends, it is recognized that this Zoning Ordinance should provide
for more detailed evaluation of each use conditionally permissible in a
specific district with respect to such considerations as location, design,
size, method(s) of operation, intensity of use, public facilities requirements,
and traffic generation. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to
the procedures and requirements of subsections (c) to (j) hereof.
   (c)   Contents of Conditional Use Permit Application. Any owner, or agent
thereof, of property for which a conditional use is proposed shall make an
application for a conditional use permit by filing it with the Zoning
Commissioner, who shall within seven days, transmit it to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. For purposes of this subsection, the applicant shall pay the necessary
fees to the Fiscal Officer, and submit the completed form to either the Fiscal
Officer or to the Zoning Inspector personally. An application which is
submitted to the Fiscal Officer shall then be faxed or sent electronically to
the Zoning Commissioner on receipt by the Fiscal Officer. Such application at a
minimum shall contain the following information:
(1)   Name, address and phone number of the applicant;
(2)   Legal description of the property;
(3)   Zoning district;
(4)   Description of existing use;
(5)   Description of proposed conditional use;
(6)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the location
of all buildings, parking and loading areas, streets and traffic access, open
spaces, refuse and service areas, utilities, signs, yards, landscaping
features, and such other information as the Board of Zoning Appeals may
require;
(7)   A narrative statement discussing the compatibility of the proposed use
with the existing uses of adjacent properties and with the comprehensive plan,
to include an evaluation of the effects on adjoining properties of such
elements as traffic circulation, noise, glare, odor, fumes, and vibration;
(8)   A list containing the names and mailing addresses of all owners of
property within five hundred feet of the property in question;
(9)   A fee as established by ordinance;
(10)   A narrative addressing each of the applicable criteria contained in
subsection (d) hereof.
   (d)   General Standards For All Conditional Uses. In addition to the
specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses, the Board shall review
the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the
following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at
the proposed location:
(1)   Is in fact a conditional use as established under the provisions of
Chapters
1108 through
1115 and appears on the Schedule of District Regulations adopted for the zoning
district involved;
(2)   Will be in accordance with the general objectives, or with any specific
objective, of the Village's comprehensive plan and/or the Zoning Ordinance;
(3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
(4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring
uses;
(5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services
such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures,
refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
(6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost for
public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
(7)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property, or
the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke,
fumes, glare, or odors;
(8)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so designed
as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares;
(9)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural, scenic,
or historic feature of major importance.
   (e)   Specific Criteria For Conditional Uses. The following are specific
conditional use criteria and requirements for those uses conditionally
permitted in this Zoning Ordinance as provided for in Section
1104.10  (e). Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Board of Zoning
Appeals from prescribing supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition to
these requirements in accordance with Section
1104.07 (g).
   (f)   Procedure and Requirements to Determine That A Use Is Substantially
Similar. 
(1)   Where a specific use is proposed that is not listed or provided for in
this Zoning Ordinance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may make a determination,
upon appeal, that the proposed use is substantially similar to a specific use
that is listed or provided for in this Zoning Ordinance. If the Board finds
that a use is substantially similar to a specific use listed in this Zoning
Ordinance, the substantially similar use is deemed to be a substantially
similar permitted use in those districts where the specific use is a permitted
use, and a substantially similar conditional use in those districts where the
specific use is a conditionally permitted use.
(2)   In formulating a determination that a proposed use is a substantially
similar use, the Board shall follow the procedures relating to appeals and
variances as specified in Sections
1104.07 and
1104.08. Upon making a determination that a proposed use is substantially
similar, the Board shall notify the Council of its decision and shall include
in its written findings the reasoning upon which the decision is based. Unless
the decision is rejected within thirty days of its receipt by the Council, such
substantially similar use determination by the Board shall become effective.
   (g)   Remedy By Application For Amendment. If the Board of Zoning Appeals
determines that a proposed use is not substantially similar, such determination
shall not be appealed to the Council, but remedy may be sought by the appellant
through the submission of an application for amendment as prescribed in Chapter
1105.
   (h)   Standards For Consideration Of Substantially Similar Uses. The
following standards shall be considered by the Board when making a
determination that a use is substantially similar to a permitted or a
conditional use within a specific district:
(1)   The compatibility of the proposed use with the general use classification
system as specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
(2)   The nature, predominant characteristics, and intensity of the proposed
use in relation to those uses specified by this Zoning Ordinance as being
permitted, or in the case of a conditional use, conditionally permitted, in
that district.
(3)   The size, dimensional requirements, parking requirements, traffic
generation potential, and other regulatory considerations normally associated
with uses as specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (i)   Effect of Determination That A Use Is Substantially Similar. Should a
use be determined to be substantially similar to a specific permitted or
conditionally permitted use provided for in this Zoning Ordinance, it shall
then be permitted in the same manner under the same conditions and procedures
as the use is permitted to which it has been found to be substantially similar.
   (j)   Record of Substantially Similar Uses. The Zoning Commissioner shall
maintain as a public record a listing of all uses which have been determined to
be substantially similar. For each such use the record shall include the use as
listed in the Zoning Ordinance, the use unlisted in the Zoning Ordinance about
which the determination of substantial similarity was made, and the dates of
any actions thereupon by the Board of Zoning Appeals or the Council. This
record shall also contain the same information for all uses which have been
determined not to be substantially similar. The Zoning Commissioner shall
consult this record in the process of issuing future permits.

1117.15 BED AND BREAKFAST FACILITIES.
   These regulations are intended to allow for a more efficient use of large,
older houses in residential areas if the neighborhood character is preserved to
maintain both the residential neighborhood experience and the bed and breakfast
experience. These regulations enable owners to maintain large residential
structures in a manner which keeps them primarily in residential uses. The
proprietor can take advantage of the scale and often the architectural and
historical significance of a residence. The regulations provide an alternative
form of lodging for visitors that prefer a residential setting.

accessory use to a household living on the site. This means that the individual
or family who operates the facility must occupy the house as their primary
residence.
(e)   Maximum Size: Bed and breakfast facilities are limited to a maximum of
four bedrooms for guests and a maximum of eight (8) guests per night. In the
single dwelling zones, bed and breakfast facilities over these size limits are
prohibited.
(f)   Employees: Bed and breakfasts facilities may have nonresident employees
for the lodging activity such as booking rooms and food preparation, if
approved as part of the conditional use review. Hired service for normal
maintenance, repair and care of the residence or site such as yard maintenance
will not be considered employees of the bed and breakfast facilities.
(g)   Services to Guests: Food service may be provided only to overnight guests
of a bed and breakfast facility.
(h)   Commercial Meetings: Activities including luncheons, banquets, parties,
weddings, meetings, charitable fund raising, commercial or advertising
activities, or other gatherings for direct or indirect compensation, are
permitted at a bed and breakfast facility subject to the occupancy limitations
outlined in subsection (e) above.
(i)   Consecutive Nights: Each paying guest may stay at a bed and breakfast for
not more than thirty (30) consecutive nights at any single visit nor more than
a total of forty-five (45) nights in any calendar year.
(j)   Development Standards: Bed and breakfast facilities must comply with the
development standards of the base zone.
(k)   Appearance: Residential structures may be remodeled for the development
of a bed and breakfast facility. However, structural alterations may not be
made which prevent the structure being used as a residence as a residence in
the future. Internal or external changes which will make the dwelling appear
less residential in function are not allowed. Examples of such alterations
include installation of more than five parking spaces, paving of required
setbacks, and commercial type exterior lighting.
(l)   Signs: Signs must meet the regulations for houses.
(m)   Parking: One off-street parking space shall be required per guest room.
If parking spaces are off-site, a written agreement between the owner of the
parking space(s) and the bed and breakfast facility operator is required.
(n)   Conditional Review: Bed and breakfast facilities require a conditional
review. The approval criteria are stated in Section
1104.10.
(o)   Monitoring: All bed and breakfast facilities must maintain a guest log
book. It must include the names and home addresses of guests, guest's license
plate numbers if traveling by car, dates of stay, and the room number of each
guest. The log must be available for inspection by Village Staff upon request.

1117.19 REGULATIONS FOR SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES.
(I)   PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   Pursuant to Sections 503.51 and 503.52 of the Ohio Revised Code, the
New London Village Council makes the following statement of intent and
findings:
(1)   Adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the
public safety agencies of the Village of New London in order to protect and
preserve the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the patrons and employees
of the businesses as well as the citizens of the Village of New London.
(2)   The New London Village Council finds that adult entertainment
establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including
prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature.
(3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health
concern of the Village of New London that demands reasonable regulation of
adult entertainment establishments by the Village of New London in the
specified manner, and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult
entertainment establishments by local governments, in order to protect the
health and well-being of the citizens.
(4)   Minimal regulations enacted by the Village of New London are a legitimate
and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult
entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure
that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places
of illegal sexual activity or solicitation.
(5)   There is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment
establishments, because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both
the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas
adjacent to them, cause increased crime, particularly in the overnight hours,
and downgrade property values.
(6)   The New London Village Council desires to minimize and control these
adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the
specified manner. And by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects, the
New London Village Council seeks to protect the health, safety, and welfare of
the citizenry; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality
of life; preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods; and deter the spread of urban blight.
(7)   The New London Village Council has determined that current local zoning
and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health, safety, and
general welfare of the people of the Village of New London and that expanded
regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary.
(8)   It is not the intent of the New London Village Council in enacting this
act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected
by the First Amendment, but to enact content-neutral statutes that address the
secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments.
(9)   It is not the intent of the New London Village Council to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the New London Village
Council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of
obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to
enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this
state.
   (b)   It is the intent of the New London Village Council in enacting this
Ordinance to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment
establishments in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the Village of New London and establish reasonable
regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment
establishments within the Village of New London. The provisions of this
Ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of the New London Village
Council in enacting this Ordinance to restrict or deny, or authorize the
restriction or denial of, access by adults to sexually oriented materials
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny, or authorize the denial of,
access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult
materials to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of the
New London Village Council in enacting this Ordinance to condone or legitimize
the distribution or exhibition of obscene material.
   (c)   Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the
legislature and subsequently adopted by the Ohio General Assembly as findings

Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, Jan. 12, 2000; and
from various other police reports, testimony, newspaper reports, and other

Grand Rapids, Michigan Decency Action Council (6th Cir. 2008), 526 F.3d 291;
729, Inc. v. Kenton County Fiscal Court (6th Cir. 2008), 515 F.3d 485; and
Andy's Rest. & Lounge, Inc. v. City of Gary (7th Cir. 2006), 466 F.3d 550, and
the New London Village Council' independent review of the same) the New London
Village Council finds:
(1)   Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of
the establishments.
(2)   Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments, as defined in
this Ordinance as adult theaters and cabarets, engage in a higher incidence of
certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other
establishments.
(3)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult
entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or
semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows.
The "couch dances" or "lap dances" that frequently occur in adult entertainment
establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may
constitute the offense of "engaging in prostitution" under Section 2907.25 of
the Revised Code.
(4)   Offering and providing private or semi-private booths or cubicles
encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions.
(5)   Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other adult
entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity
within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments.
(6)   Numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in
sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis,
gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes,
hepatitis salmonella, campylobacter and shigella infections, chlamydial,
myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections, trichomoniasis, and chancroid.
(7)   Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative
number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) in the United States: 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in
1985, and 253,448 through December 31, 1992.
(8)   A total of 10,255 AIDS cases had been reported in Ohio as of January
1999. Ohio has required HIV case reporting since 1990, and the reported
information shows 7,969 people living with (HIV) (4,213) and (AIDS) (3,756) in
the state.
(9)   Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative
number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test in Ohio.
(10)   The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United
States reported annually has risen. 33,613 cases were reported in 1982, and
45,200 cases were reported through November 1990.
(11)   The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually
remains at a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in
1990.
(12)   The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22,
1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be
transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, and exposure to
infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her
newborn.
(13)   According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as
well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts.
(14)   Sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are
unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and,
in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of
the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
(15)   The findings noted in divisions (c)(1) to (14) of this section raise
substantial governmental concerns.
(16)   Adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that
require or mandate subject them to reasonable government regulation in order to
protect those substantial governmental concerns.
(17)   The enactment of this Ordinance will promote the general welfare,
health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the Village of New London.

renewal license application or the revocation or suspension of a license is
still pending thirty (30) days before the expiration date of any license, the
licensee may file a renewal license application with the New London Zoning
Commissioner or his or her designee pursuant to this Ordinance. In the event
that an application for renewal of a license is denied and the applicant seeks
judicial review of that denial, the Village of New London has the right to
consolidate such review with any pending judicial actions in regards to the
previous denial, suspension or revocation of a license.
   (e)   If, during the pendency of any appeal pursued under sub-section (b)
above, there are additional denials of a renewal license application or
suspensions or revocations of that license, the Village of New London has the
right to consolidate the appeal pursued under Section (XI), sub-section (b)
above for the additional denials, suspensions or revocations with any pending
appeal for that same licensee.

1120.05 INTERIOR PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING.
   Landscaping within parking areas, whether ground cover or upright plant
material is necessary, not only to reduce the generation of heat and water
runoff, but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas. The use of parking
islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot is
required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these
landscape areas is encouraged. Any open parking area containing more than six
thousand square feet (6,000 sf) of area or fifteen (15) or more parking spaces
shall provide the following interior landscaping.
(a)   An area equal to five percent (5%) of the total area devoted to parking
spaces and parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
(b)   Whenever possible, large parking areas of thirty thousand square feet
(30,000 sf) or larger shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse
and create the appearance of small parking lots. This distinction or separation
can be achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas
and by taking advantage of natural features such as slope, existing woodland,
or vegetation, drainage courses, and retention areas.
(c)   Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in peninsulas
or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be one hundred eighty
square feet (180 sf) with a two foot (2') minimum distance between all trees or
shrubs and the edge of pavement where vehicles overhang and should have a
minimum width of ten feet (10'). Islands shall typically be located every ten
(10) to twelve (12) parking spaces and may be curbed.
(d)   The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas shall be
one (1) deciduous tree for every three thousand square feet (3,000 sf). Where
site distance or maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall have a clear trunk of
at least five feet (5') above the ground, and the remaining required landscape
areas shall be planted with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed two feet (2')
in height.
      (Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1120.06 PLANT MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   The following sections include specifications for plant materials.
Alternatives to these materials, than can be shown to meet both the intent and
requirements of this Ordinance, may be approved as part of a site plan:
(a)   Shrubs: Shrubs shall be at least twenty-four inches (24") average height
and spread at the time of planting and, where required for screening, shall
form a continuous, year-round, solid visual screen within five (5) years after
planting.
(b)   Ground Cover and Grass: Ground cover shall be planted a minimum of eight
inches (8") on center and shall be planted in such a manner to present a
finished appearance and seventy-five percent (75%) coverage after one (1)
complete growing season. If approved as part of a Site Plan, ground cover may
also consist of rocks, pebbles, wood chips, and other material. Grass shall be
planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns.
(c)   Within any required landscaping, the following tree species may not be
used:
 
 
Box Elder      Siberian Elm
Black Walnut   Mulberry
Mountain Ash   Catalpa
Hickory        Willow
Tree of Heaven Black Locust
Poplar
In addition to the specific species listed, trees which produce nuts, seeds, or
fruit that can create a hazard to pedestrians or vehicles, shall not be planted
in such a manner that the natural dripline of an average adult tree of the
species planted will be any closer than three feet (3') of a pedestrian walkway
or parking lot.
      (Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1120.07 SCREENING OF EXTERIOR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT.
   Exterior components of plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and
ventilating systems (including but not limited to piping, tanks, stacks,
collectors, heating, cooling, and ventilating-equipment fans, blowers,
ductwork, vents louvers, meters, compressors, motors, incinerators, ovens,
etc.) shall not be directly visible at ground level. Any landscaping or
structural means employed to screen exterior components of plumbing,
processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems from direct view, shall
appear as integrated parts of the buildings and shall be constructed of
complementary and durable materials and finished in a texture and color scheme
complementary to the overall architectural design. Any exterior components of
plumbing, processing, heating, cooling, and ventilating systems and their
screening devices which will be visible from upper floors of adjacent buildings
shall be kept to a visible minimum, shall be installed in a neat and compact
fashion and shall be painted in such a color as to allow their blending with
their visual backgrounds.
(Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1120.08 MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner shall be responsible for maintaining all landscaping in good
condition to present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. This should be
accomplished by the following standards:
(a)   All plant growth in landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning,
trimming, or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere
with public utilities, restrict pedestrian or vehicular access, or otherwise
constitute a traffic hazard.
(b)   All planted areas shall be maintained in a relatively weed-free
condition, clear of undesirable undergrowth and free from refuse and debris.
(c)   Replacement plants shall conform to the standards that govern original
planting/installation. Dead or unhealthy plants, shrubs, grass, and trees shall
be replaced within the next planting season.

premises existing and lawful at the time of enactment of this Ordinance,
supplement, or amendment may continue, even though such use does not conform
with the provisions of this Ordinance or any supplement or amendment made after
the enactment of this Ordinance. If no structural alterations are made, a non-
conforming use of a building may be changed to another non-conforming use of
the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a non-conforming use
has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not be changed thereafter to a less restricted use.
   The non-conforming use of any land or premises existing on the effective
date of the Zoning Ordinance may be continued provided that no such non-
conforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or extended either on the
same or adjoining property, except when authorized by the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1104. If such non-conforming use of land or any portion is discontinued or
changed, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   In the event that a non-conforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure and of any lot or premises is voluntary discontinued for a period of
twenty-four (24) months or more, any future use of the lot, building, or
structure shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (c)   Any building arranged, intended, or designated for a non-conforming
use, but at the time of the passage of the Zoning Ordinance is not being so
used and continues to be unused for a period of twenty-four (24) months from
the time of the passage of the Zoning Ordinance shall not, after such twenty-
four (24) months, be used except in conformity with the regulations of the
district in which such building is located.
   (d)   Without prior approval, a non-conforming use may be extended
throughout that portion of a structure that was obviously designed and intended
for such use.
   (e)   Any building arranged, intended or designated for a non-conforming
use, the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of
this Zoning Ordinance but not completed, may be completed and put into such
non-conforming use provided it is done within one (1) year after the Zoning
Ordinance takes effect.
   (f)   When a non-conforming building or structure has been damaged by fire,
explosion, act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than 75 percent
(75%) of its fair market value, it shall not be restored or reconstructed
except in conformity with regulations of the zoned district in which the
building or structure is located.
   (g)   When a non-conforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage,
a building permit shall be secured for that purpose and reconstruction shall be
diligently completed without delay. Failure to reconstruct within a year of
damage revokes the right to non-conforming use, and the premises shall conform
thereafter to the established district regulations.
   (h)   When non-conforming trailers or mobile homes are located on a lot in
any district other than a mobile home park and are once removed, they shall not
be relocated on such lot and shall not be replaced with another trailer or
mobile home.

this Ordinance which this Ordinance amends or of a Zoning Ordinance covering an
area of a city, village, or township subsequently annexed to the Village of New
London shall not be validated by the adoption of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1121.02 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   If any structure was built prior to the adoption of this Ordinance and is
considered to have non-conforming setbacks, additions to, or enlargement of an
existing structure which presently encroaches upon required side or rear yards
may be permitted if the proposed addition or enlargement follow the existing
structure setbacks, and the addition or enlargement will not exceed any other
lot lines.
(Ord. 2015-09. Passed 7-13-15.)
1121.03 ABANDONED AUTOMOBILE SERVICE STATIONS, GAS STATIONS, OR FILLING
STATIONS.

station, gas station, or filling station shall be defined as one in which the
petitioner or lessee has failed to operate for at least six (6) consecutive
months in any eighteen (18) month period.
   (b)   All automobile service stations, gas stations, or filling stations
where use is discontinued after the enactment of this Ordinance shall be
presumed to be a nuisance affecting or endangering surrounding property values
and to be detrimental to the public health, safety, convenience, comfort,
property, or general welfare of the community and shall be abated.

established by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as the

      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure,
or site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.

evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship, which characterize building, structure, or site, shall be
treated with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be substantiated by historic, physical, or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other buildings or structures.

gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources, affected by or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural, or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood, or environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of Interior's
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberation.
   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design review
criteria with Council approval based on the Preservation District's predominant
architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/archaeological
attributes.

   No alteration of any structure or significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in the designated Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to

plans, specifications, and other material as the Design Review Board may from
time to time prescribe.
   (b)    Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans, and specifications.
   (c)    If the proposed alteration is determined to have no adverse effect by
the Design Review Board on the Preservation District and does not violate the
spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Village Administrator or
designee shall issue the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (d)    If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)    In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the
forty-five (45) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall
not be issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such
determination and may include recommendations respecting the proposed
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place,
building, structure, site, object, or work of art. The Village Administrator or
designee shall forthwith notify the of such determination and transmit to him/
her a certified copy of the reasons for denial and
recommendations, if any, of the Board.
   (f)    Upon denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both. The first meeting between Board and applicant shall be held within
thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal is
accepted by both parties, the Board may henceforth authorize the issuance of a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (g)    In the case of denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition, the Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of find a method of saving the structure,
and such good faith meetings shall be held at least every forty-five (45) days
after the initial meeting.
   (h)    If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board denial of the application will stand.
   (i)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
the Design Review Board, then and in such event, the Village Administrator or
designee shall issue a Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed
construction, reconstruction, or alteration.
   (j)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction,
reconstruction, demolition, or alteration is reached; then, the applicant may
appeal the decision to Council. Council may affirm or reverse the Board
decision. If Council affirms the decision, the denial of certificate of
appropriateness will stand. (Ord. 2024-22. Passed 10-28-24.)

will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of New London, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
the ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violation and Penalties. Violation of the provision of this chapter or
failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a minor
misdemeanor. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate
offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of New London from
taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violations.

provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Appeals Board shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where
applicable;
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and flood plain management program for that area;
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;

substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (a)(4) hereof have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (a)(4) hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
         (Ord. 87-7. Passed 4-21-87.)
1305.05 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
   (a)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)   All manufactured homes not otherwise regulated by the Ohio Revised
Code pertaining to manufactured home parks shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or
frame ties to ground anchors.
   (b)   Construction Materials and Methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (c)   Utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
      (3)   Individual waste water treatment systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (d)   Subdivision Proposals.
      (1)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
      (2)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)   All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home subdivision,

proposals, including manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed
developments which contain at least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less).
         (Ord. 87-7. Passed 4-21-87.)
1305.06 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in Section
1305.03(d)(2), the following provisions are required:
   (a)   Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the base flood elevation.
   (b)   Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buyoancy; and,
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1305.03(a)(3).
   (c)   Accessory Structures. An exemption to the evaluation or dry
floodproofing standards may be granted for accessory structures (e.g., sheds,
detached garages) containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such
structures must meet the encroachment provisions of Section
1305.07 (a) and the following additional standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation;
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or floodproofed.
   (d)   Manufactured Homes. The following standards shall apply to all new and
substantially improved manufactured homes not subject to the manufactured home
requirements of Ohio R.C. 3733.01.
      (1)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with Section
1305.05(a)(2).

within A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM, be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above
the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored
foundation system in accordance with the provisions of this section. This
paragraph applies to manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. This
paragraph does not apply to manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision except where the
repair, reconstruction, or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads
equals, or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of the streets, utilities
and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement has commenced.
         (Ord. 87-16. Passed 9-1-87.)
   (e)   Enclosures Below Base Flood Elevation. This provisions applies to all
new and substantially improvement residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to or above base flood elevations using pilings, columns, or
posts or which contain a crawl space. These structures may enclose the area
below base flood elevation provided that the enclosed areas are designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing
for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Specific design criteria are found in
the National Flood Insurance Program Rules and Regulations.
      (Ord. 87-7. Passed 4-21-87.)
1305.07 FLOODWAYS.
   A floodway is the channel of a river or other water course and adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. The
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters
which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential. The Flood
Insurance Rate Map (or Flood Hazard Boundary Map) does not designate a
floodway. However, floodways may be delineated in other available sources of
flood information as specified in Section
1305.04(d)(2). The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway
areas:
   (a)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a technical evaluation demonstrates
that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
   (b)   If subsection (a) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Sections
1305.05 and
1305.06.
