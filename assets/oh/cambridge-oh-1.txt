intention, the spelling shall be corrected, and the words supplied, omitted, or

   (H)   The grievance procedure shall be concluded at any step where an
agreement has been reached by both parties. Any award in favor of the grievant
will be immediately implemented. No party in a higher step in the grievance
procedure may veto or reverse a decision that is favorable to the grievant. In
the event that either party fails to answer a grievance during the time
specified in the grievance procedure step, then the grievance will be
considered settled against the side which defaulted.
   (I)   (1) All grievances must follow the chain of appeal as specified by
this grievance procedure, with the exception of demotions, suspension, or
dismissals, which will go directly to the Mayor, skipping §
35.37 steps one, two, and three. At no other time will an employee bypass a
supervisor or department head.
      (2) Nothing in this grievance procedure is intended to deny employees any
rights available under the civil service laws or the laws of the state.
(`63 Code, § 158.02) (Ord. 32-80, passed 4-14-80)
§ 35.37 STEPS.
   (A)   Step one: Informal discussion. An employee having a grievance will
first attempt to resolve it informally with his immediate supervisor at the
time the incident giving rise to the grievance occurs, or within two working
days from the date of the matter causing dissatisfaction if the supervisor is
not available at the time of the occurrence. At this step, there is no reason
to put the grievance in writing, no report needs to be submitted by the
supervisor. If the grievant so desires, a grievance representative may be
present. The supervisor and the employee or employees shall make every effort
to resolve the problem or to correct the misunderstanding at this level.
   (B)   Step two: immediate supervisor (formal).
      (1)   If the grievance is not settled in Step one, an employee having a
grievance shall present it in writing to his immediate supervisor, or to his
designated supervisory representative within five working days after the event
or circumstances giving rise to the grievance have occurred, except in such
cases where extenuating circumstances prevent filing within this time limit.
Grievances submitted beyond the five days limit need not be honored although
they will be processed through this procedure if the time limits are waived at
this step.
      (2)   The grievance at this step shall be submitted to the supervisor
using the form jointly developed by parties involved. This notice in writing
should include:
         (a)   A statement of the grievance and relevant facts;
         (b)   Remedy sought;
         (c)   Provision of the contract or personnel manual that was violated;
         (d)   Any recommendations or suggestions.
      (3)   At this step, the grievant may bring with him the appropriate
grievance representative. Within two working days following the supervisor's
receipt of the written grievance, he will then conduct a meeting with the
grievant and the grievance representative.
   (C)   Step three: Safety-Service Director.
      (1)   Should the grievant not be satisfied with the written answer he
received in Step two, within two working days after the receipt thereof, he may
submit the original and both copies to the Safety-Service Director and request
that the meeting contemplated by this step shall be scheduled.
      (2)   At the conclusion of this meeting, and not to exceed two working
days after the receipt of the grievance forms, the Safety-Service Director
shall respond to this grievance by writing his answer on the original and all
copies of the grievance form and then returning the original and one copy
thereof to the employee or grievant.
   (D)   Step four: Mayor.
      (1)   Should the grievant not be satisfied with the written answer he
received in Step three, within three working days after his receipt thereof, he
may submit the original of the grievance form and one copy to the Mayor and
request the meeting contemplated by this step be scheduled.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the original and one copy of the written grievance
form, the Mayor shall have them stamped to show the date of his receipt of them
and shall schedule a meeting to be held within five working days to discuss the
grievance.
      (3)   Prior to a Step four meeting, the Mayor or his designated
representative shall make a thorough investigation of the circumstances and
allegations surrounding the grievance. Such investigations include the taking
of written statements, reviewing all available written reports, answers at the
prior steps, corrective action reports, assignment sheets, time records,
written instructions, policies, rules, regulations, and all other information
pertinent to the grievance.
      (4)   Upon completion of the Step four meeting, the Mayor shall determine
whether the contemplated answer is consistent with policies. The Mayor shall
render his decision in writing on both copies of the grievance and return a
copy to the grievant and to the grievance representative within five working
days after the meeting with the grievant.
   (E)   Step five: Grievance Review Committee.
      (1)   Employees may request in writing within five working days after
receipt of the written decision by the Mayor in Step four that a grievance
review committee be set up to review the decision of the Mayor.
      (2)   This committee should consist of three members: one appointed by
the President of Council, one appointed by the grievant, and the third member
who shall be chairman of this committee, shall be jointly appointed by both the
President of Council and the grievant.
      (3)   The findings and recommendations of this committee shall be made in
confidence to the grievant and Mayor within ten working days after the
appointment of the chairman.
      (4)   The Mayor then shall render a final decision within ten working
days after receipt of the recommendation from the committee as per their
recommendation.
      (5)    A copy of the grievance form, with all comments and procedures
included, will be placed in the employee's personnel folder as a permanent
record.
      (6)   The grievance form will be provided by the city with required
copies.

IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM
§ 36.01 OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM.
   The purpose of this Identity Theft Prevention Program (Program) is to
protect customers of the city's utility services from identity theft. The
Program is intended to establish reasonable policies and procedures to
facilitate the detection, prevention and mitigation of identity theft in
connection with the opening of new covered accounts and activity on existing
covered accounts.
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.02 PROGRAM COMMITTEE.
   The Identify Theft Prevention Program Committee shall consist of the
following members: City Auditor, Service/Safety Director, Law Director, Clerk
of Council, and Utilities Office Manager. The Committee shall meet twice a year
to assess the program and provide a yearly report to City Council.
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.03 SCOPE.
   This Program applies to the creation, modification and access to identifying
information of a customer of one or more of the utilities operated by the
municipality (electric, water, sewer, and refuse) by any and all personnel of
the municipality, including management personnel. This Program does not replace
or repeal any previously existing policies or programs addressing some or all
of the activities that are the subject of this Program, but rather it is
intended to supplement any such existing policies and programs.
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.04 DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this Program, the following terms have the meanings set forth
opposite their name, unless the context clearly requires that the term be given
a different meaning:
   COVERED ACCOUNT. An account that the city offers or maintains, primarily for
personal, family or household purposes, that involves or is designed to permit
multiple payments of transactions. (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(i)) A utility account is
a "covered account." The term COVERED ACCOUNT also includes other accounts
offered or maintained by the municipality for which there is a reasonably
foreseeable risk to customers, the municipality, or its customers, from
identity theft. (16 CFR 681.2(b)(3)(ii))
   IDENTITY THEFT. A fraud committed or attempted using the identifying
information of another person without authority. (16 CFR 681.2(b)(8) and 16 CFR
603.2(a))
   IDENTIFYING INFORMATION. Any name or number that may be used, alone or in
conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person,
including any name, Social Security number, date of birth, official state or
government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration
number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number.
Additional examples of identifying information are set forth in 16 CFR 603.2
(a).
   RED FLAG. A pattern, practice or specific activity that indicates the
possible existence of identity theft.
   Certain terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them in the FTC's Identity Theft Rules (16 CFR Part 681) or the Fair
Credit Reporting Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq.), as amended by the Fair
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 into law on December 4, 2003.
(Public Law 108-159)
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.05 POLICY.
   (A)   Administration of the Program. Issues to be addressed in the annual
Identity Theft Prevention Report include:
      (1)   The effectiveness of the policies and procedures in addressing the
risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of new covered accounts
and activity with respect to existing covered accounts.
      (2)   Service provider arrangements.
      (3)   Significant incidents involving identity theft and management's
response.
      (4)   Recommendations for material changes to the Program, if needed for
improvement.
   (B)   Identity theft prevention elements.
      (1)   Identification of relevant red flags. The city has considered the
guidelines and the illustrative examples of possible red flags from the FTC's
Identity Theft Rules and has reviewed the municipality's past history with
instances of identity theft, if any. The municipality hereby determines that
the following are the relevant red flags for purposes of this Program given the
relative size of the municipality and the limited nature and scope of the
services that the municipality provides to its citizens:
         (a)   Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer
reporting agencies or service providers.
            1.   A fraud or active duty alert is included with a consumer
report or an identity verification response from a credit reporting agency.
            2.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of credit freeze
in response to a request for a consumer report.
            3.   A consumer reporting agency provides a notice of address
discrepancy, as defined in § 681.1(b) of the FTC's Identity Theft Rules.
            4.   A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity that is
inconsistent with the history and usual pattern of activity of an applicant or
customer, such as:
               a.   A recent and significant increase in the volume of
inquiries;
               b.   An unusual number of recently established credit
relationships;
               c.   A material change in the use of credit, especially with
respect to recently established credit relationships; or
               d.   An account that was closed for cause or identified for
abuse of account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.
         (b)   The presentation of suspicious documents.
            1.   Documents provided for identification appear to have been
altered or forged.
            2.   The photograph or physical description on the identification
is not consistent with the appearance of the applicant or customer presenting
the identification.
            3.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person opening a new covered account or customer
presenting the identification.
            4.   Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that is on file with the municipality, such as a
signature card or a recent check.
            5.   An application appears to have been altered or forged, or
gives the appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.
         (c)   The presentation of suspicious personal identifying information,
such as a suspicious address change.
            1.   Personal identifying information provided is inconsistent when
compared against external information sources used by the municipality. For
example:
               a.   The address does not match any address in the consumer
report or CRA ID Check response; or
               b.   The Social Security number (SSN) has not been issued, or is
listed on the Social Security Administration's Death Master File.
            2.   Personal identifying information provided by the customer is
not consistent with other personal identifying information provided by the
customer. For example, there is a lack of correlation between the SSN range and
date of birth.
            3.   Personal identifying information provided is associated with
known fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used
by the municipality. For example:
               a.   The address on an application is the same as the address
provided on a fraudulent application; or
               b.   The phone number on an application is the same as the
number provided on a fraudulent application.
            4.   Personal identifying information provided is of a type
commonly associated with fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-
party sources used by the municipality. For example:
               a.   The billing address on an application is fictitious, a mail
drop, or a prison; or
               b.   The phone number is invalid, or is associated with a pager
or answering service.
            5.   The SSN provided is the same as that submitted by other
persons opening an account or other customers.
            6.   The address or telephone number provided is the same as or
similar to the account number or telephone number submitted by an unusually
large number of other persons opening accounts or other customers.
            7.   The person opening the covered account or the customer fails
to provide all required personal identifying information on an application or
in response to notification that the application is incomplete.
            8.   Personal identifying information provided is not consistent
with personal identifying information that is on file with the municipality.
            9.   If the municipality uses challenge questions, the person
opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide authenticating
information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or
consumer report.
         (d)   The unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a
covered account.
            1.   Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the municipality receives a request for the addition of
authorized users on the account.
            2.   A new utility account is used in a manner commonly associated
with known patterns of fraud patterns. For example: the customer fails to make
the first payment or makes an initial payment but no subsequent payments.
            3.   A covered account with a stable history shows irregularities.
            4.   A covered account that has been inactive for a reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of account,
the expected pattern of usage and other relevant factors).
            5.   Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as
undeliverable although usage of utility products or services continues in
connection with the customer's covered account.
            6.   The municipality is notified that the customer is not
receiving paper account statements.
            7.   The municipality is notified of unauthorized usage of utility
products or services in connection with a customer's covered account.
         (e)   Notice of possible identity theft. The municipality is notified
by a customer, a victim of identity theft, a law enforcement authority, or any
other person that it has opened a fraudulent account for a person engaged in
identity theft.
      (2)   Detection of red flags.
         (a)   The employees of the city that interact directly with customers
on a day-to-day basis shall have the initial responsibility for monitoring the
information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider in connection with the opening of new accounts and the
modification of or access to existing accounts and the detection of any red
flags that might arise. Management shall see to it that all employees who might
be called upon to assist a customer with the opening of a new account or with
modifying or otherwise accessing an existing account are properly trained such
that they have a working familiarity with the relevant red flags identified in
this Program so as to be able to recognize any red flags that might surface in
connection with the transaction. An employee who is not sufficiently trained to
recognize the red flags identified in this Program shall not open a new account
for any customer, modify any existing account or otherwise provide any customer
with access to information in an existing account without the direct
supervision and specific approval of a management employee. Management
employees shall be properly trained such that they can recognize the relevant
red flags identified in this Program and exercise sound judgment in connection
with the response to any unresolved red flags that may present themselves in
connection with the opening of a new account or with modifying or accessing of
an existing account. Management employees shall be responsible for making the
final decision on any such unresolved red flags.
         (b)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the manner in which a prospective new customer may
apply for service, the information and documentation to be provided by the
prospective customer in connection with an application for a new utility
service account, the steps to be taken by the employee assisting the customer
with the application in verifying the customer's identity and the manner in
which the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-
party service provider shall be maintained. Such policy shall be generally
consistent with the spirit of the Customer Identification Program rules (31 CFR
103.121) implementing Section 326(a) of the USA Patriot Act but need not be as
detailed. The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a written
policy setting forth the manner in which customers with existing accounts shall
establish their identity before being allowed to make modifications to or
otherwise gain access to existing accounts.
      (3)   Response to detected red flags.
         (a)   If the responsible employees of the city as set forth in the
previous section are unable, after making a good faith effort, to form a
reasonable belief that they know the true identity of a customer attempting to
open a new account or modify or otherwise access an existing account based on
the information and documentation provided by the customer and any third-party
service provider, the municipality shall not open the new account or modify or
otherwise provide access to the existing account as the case may be.
Discrimination in respect to the opening of new accounts or the modification or
access to existing accounts will not be tolerated by employees of the
municipality and shall be grounds for immediate dismissal.
         (b)   The Program Administrator shall establish from time to time a
written policy setting forth the steps to be taken in the event of an
unresolved red flag situation. Consideration should be given to aggravating
factors that may heighten the risk of identity theft, such as a data security
incident that results in unauthorized access to a customer's account, or a
notice that a customer has provided account information to a fraudulent
individual or website. Appropriate responses to prevent or mitigate identity
theft when a red flag is detected include:
            1.   Monitoring a covered account for evidence of identity theft.
            2.   Contacting the customer.
            3.   Changing any passwords, security codes, or other security
devices that permit access to a covered account.
            4.   Reopening a covered account with a new account number.
            5.   Not opening a new covered account.
            6.   Closing an existing covered account.
            7.   Not attempting to collect on a covered account or not selling
a covered account to a debt collector.
            8.   Notifying law enforcement.
            9.   Determining that no response is warranted under the particular
circumstances.
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.06 PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
   (A)   Initial risk assessment - covered accounts. Utility accounts for
personal, family and household purposes are specifically included within the
definition of "covered account" in the FTC's Identity Theft Rules. Therefore,
the city determines that with respect to its residential utility accounts it
offers and/or maintains covered accounts. The municipality also performed an
initial risk assessment to determine whether the utility offers or maintains
any other accounts for which there are reasonably foreseeable risks to
customers or the utility from identity theft. In making this determination the
municipality considered the methods it uses to open its accounts, the methods
it uses to access its accounts, and its previous experience with identity
theft, and it concluded that it does not offer or maintain any such other
covered accounts.
   (B)   Program updates - risk assessment. The Program, including relevant red
flags, is to be updated as often as necessary but at least annually to reflect
changes in risks to customers from identity theft. Factors to consider in the
Program update include:
      (1)   An assessment of the risk factors identified above.
      (2)   Any identified red flag weaknesses in associated account systems or
procedures.
      (3)   Changes in methods of identity theft.
      (4)   Changes in methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft.
      (5)   Changes in business arrangements, including mergers, acquisitions,
alliances, joint ventures, and service provider arrangements.
   (C)   Training and oversight. All staff and third-party service providers
performing any activity in connection with one or more covered accounts are to
be provided appropriate training and receive effective oversight to ensure that
the activity is conducted in accordance with policies and procedures designed
to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft.
   (D)   Other legal requirements. Awareness of the following related legal
requirements should be maintained:
      (1)   31 U.S.C. 5318 (g) - Reporting of Suspicious Activities;
      (2)   15 U.S.C. 1681 c-1 (h) - Identity Theft Prevention; Fraud Alerts
and Active Duty Alerts - Limitations on Use of Information for Credit
Extensions;
      (3)   15 U.S.C. 1681 s-2 - Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information
to Consumer Reporting Agencies; and
      (4)   15 U.S.C. 1681 m - Requirements on Use of Consumer Reports.
(Ord. 83-08, passed 12-8-08)
§ 36.07 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The initial adoption and approval of the Identity Theft Prevention
Program shall be by Executive Order issued by the Service/Safety Director.
Thereafter, changes to the Program of a day-to-day operational character and
decisions relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Program may
be made by the Identify Theft Prevention Program Committee. Major changes or
shifts of policy positions under the Program shall only be made by the Service/
Safety Director.
   (B)   Development, implementation, administration and oversight of the
Program will be the responsibility of the Program Administrator. The Program
Administrator may, but shall not be required to, appoint a committee to
administer the Program. The Program Administrator shall be the head of any such
committee. The Program Administrator will report at least annually to the
Service/Safety Director regarding compliance with this Program.

for under the Act.
   (B)   (1)   Existing sources shall comply with all applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within three years of the Standards' effective date
unless a shorter compliance time is specified. Existing sources which become
categorical industrial users after promulgation of an applicable pretreatment
standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where those users
meet the definition of new source (see §
50.001).
      (2)   New sources shall install, have in operating condition, start up
and maintain all pollution control equipment necessary to meet applicable
Categorical Pretreatment Standards before beginning to discharge wastewater to
the sewage treatment works. New sources shall comply with all applicable
Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the shortest feasible time, but not
more than 90 days after the start of discharge.

for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (F)   (1)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any water or
wastes containing constituents exceeding the limitations established in this
chapter. State and local requirements and discharge limitations shall be met by
all dischargers subject to such Standards where these requirements and
limitations are more stringent than federal limitations.
      (2)   The Director shall establish additional or more stringent
limitations on wastewater strength, or more stringent specific limitations and
requirements on individual dischargers where deemed necessary to comply with
applicable Pretreatment Standards or the objectives of this chapter. The
Director shall notify in writing each regulated or potentially regulated
industrial user of the limitations or requirements. All limitations and
requirements established by the Director shall be subject to the provisions of
this chapter. In addition, the Director may issue specific orders to any user
or may issue general orders to all users to require compliance with any
requirements under this section, including applicable Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, other discharge limitations and reporting requirements.
   (G)   The Director may impose mass limitations on users which are using
dilution to meet the pretreatment standards or requirements of this chapter, or
in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate.
   (H)   (1)   The Director may convert limits of Categorical Pretreatment
Standards which are only expressed in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of
production to equivalent limits expressed as mass of pollutant discharged per
day, or effluent concentration to calculate effluent limits applicable to
individual users, provided the Director uses actual long-term production
figures and actual long-term flow rates. Long-term production figures and
actual long-term flow rates are only acceptable with a minimum of one complete
representative production year. The equivalent calculated limits shall be
deemed the Pretreatment Standard, and applicable users shall be required to
comply with these equivalent limits in lieu of the promulgated Categorical

      (2)   90 day compliance reports. All significant industrial users and
other users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit to the
Director within 90 days following the final compliance date of the Pretreatment
Standard, or for a new user, within 90 days after the commencement of the
discharge to the city's sewage treatment works, a report indicating the nature
and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances discharged from each
regulated process and limited by such Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures
specified in § 50.033(B). This report shall include a report of average and
maximum daily flows from these regulated processes, and for the reporting
period any other requirements as provided in 40 CFR 403.12 including
documentation indicating compliance with any and all BMPs or pollution
prevention alternative that may be stipulated in the Industrial Discharge
Permit.
      (3)   Periodic reports on continued compliance. Any Industrial User
subject to a categorical Pretreatment Standard, after the compliance date of
such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement
of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Director, at the frequency
specified in the user's Industrial Discharge Permit, a report indicating the
nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by
such categorical Pretreatment Standards. Sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures specified in §

term production rate. For all other users subject to Categorical Pretreatment
Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharged per unit of
production or other measure of operation, the reports shall include the user's
actual production during the appropriate sampling period. If an equivalent
concentration limit has been calculated in accordance with a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, this adjusted concentration limit shall also be
submitted in these reports.
      (1)   The report shall include a record of all measured, estimated,
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided, however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the Director may accept reports of average
and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The Director may require
an industrial user to install flow monitoring facilities, instruments, and
recording devices to enable accurate measurement of flows as determined to be
necessary.
      (2)   The results of any additional user self-monitoring, that is
monitoring not required by a Categorical Pretreatment Standard or by the user's
discharge permit, conducted during the monitoring/ reporting period, and for
which USEPA- approved procedures under 40 CFR 136 or approved alternative were
used may accompany the periodic compliance reports.
   (C)   Reports shall state whether the applicable Categorical Pretreatment
Standards or other standards set forth in this chapter and in the user's
wastewater discharge permit are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
what additional facilities or pretreatment is necessary to achieve compliance

supplies of water, and the quantity of water consumed on the premises shall be
deemed to be the aggregate amount disclosed by the meters. The owner of such
premises shall report such other sources of water to the Safety-Service
Director within thirty days after the sewer charge herein provided shall become
effective with respect to such premises.
   (C)   In the event it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Safety-
Service Director with respect to any premises, that a portion of the water from
any source consumed on such premises does not and cannot enter the system, then
in each such case, the owner or other interested party, may at his expense
install and maintain separate metering devices to the extent necessary to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Safety-Service Director the portion of
the water consumed on the premises which is discharged into the system, which
portion shall constitute the basis for measuring the sewer charge for the
premises under the provisions of this section.

      (6)   Condemnation and finding that the premises are unfit for human
habitation and vacated as provided in section 1305.04(c) of this code;
      (7)   Abandonment of the premises.
      (8)   Refusal to permit the Utilities Department to have access to the
premises to read the meter or to inspect water equipment.
   (B)   Unless the notice requirement is dispensed with as provided in §§
51.43 or
51.44 below, termination of service may not occur without proper notice and
adequate opportunity for hearing before termination. These rules shall be
complied with by all water division employees.
   (C)   No termination of service shall occur except in compliance with these
rules. If water service has been terminated or suspended, service shall not be
restored except if some responsible adult is available at each service address
to be restored to ensure that restoration will not cause damage to the
premises.
§ 51.42 NOTICE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Unless the notice requirement is dispensed with as provided in §§
51.43 and
51.44, written notice of proposed termination of service must be sent by the
city at least 14 days prior to the date proposed for termination. Notices may
be mailed with first class postage prepaid to reasonably assure delivery within
that time. The date of the notice shall be the date of mailing, and a dated
copy of any notice sent shall be retained by the city in the business file
relating to each service address referred to in the notice. Notices shall
clearly and conspicuously advise any recipient of each of the following facts:
      (1)   Identifying information, including the service address to be
affected, the account number, the customer's name and address, and the identity
of the city water department and its address;
      (2)   The date proposed for termination if the account is not paid, or
hearing requested, or a separate account established;
      (3)   The reason for the proposed termination, including (if applicable)
the amount claimed to be due; the location and hours at which payment in person
can be made; and the minimum payment which, tendered at or before termination,
is necessary to avoid termination.
      (4)   A notice that any individual consumer of water services may avoid
termination by:
         (a)   Paying the current month's charges,
         (b)   Paying the standard residential deposit required to initiate
water service, except that if the consumer is indigent the deposit may be made
in a reasonable number of installments, and
         (c)   Assuming responsibility for payment of future charges, if that
individual consumer does not owe an outstanding bill to the Utility Billing
Office for an account established in that consumer's name, or if any such bill
is paid or satisfactory payment arrangements are made at that time;
      (5)   A notice that a customer or consumer of water services has the
right to a hearing to contest the reasons for the proposed termination, and
that if a hearing is requested, the termination will not take place until the
hearing process is completed;
      (6)   The title, address, telephone number, and hours during which the
Utilities Department may be contacted to request a hearing, explore payment
alternatives or special consideration in hardship cases, or to assume
responsibility for future utility charges. This information will appear in all
capital letters at the bottom of the notice, after the words:
   "FINAL NOTICE - IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION OR DISPUTE ABOUT THIS BILL CALL
[INSERT INFORMATION]."
   (B)   In the event any service address that would be affected by termination
is a consumer benefitted unit, notice of termination of service, in this form
and manner, must be delivered to each service address so affected, in addition
to delivery to the customer.
§ 51.43 EMERGENCIES AND REPAIRS.
   (A)   Termination of service may occur without prior notice if emergency
circumstances involve imminent danger to persons or property, including a break
in a water service line. In cases where the Utilities Director determines there
is a threat of contamination of the public water supply or a threat to the
health of the public, termination will be immediate, until all hazards are
eliminated.
   (B)   Prior notice through local media shall be given by the city where
water service shall be lost for more than eight hours as a result of routine or
scheduled maintenance, so that consumers of water service may plan accordingly.
If the loss of water service results from a water line break or other emergency
circumstances, and is expected to, or does, last for more than four hours, the
city shall give notice to service addresses affected by such loss of service by
asking the local radio media to publicize the loss of service, the reason for
it, and the expected date and time by which the city expects to restore
service.
   (C)   If water service must be temporarily suspended on a non-emergency
basis for the purpose of repairs within the service address, a Suspension
Request form must be completed in writing by the customer contractually
obligated to pay for service at the address. If any service address that would
be affected by suspension is a consumer benefitted unit, suspension for repair
shall not be processed unless either:
      (1)   The request is also signed by an adult consumer residing at each
service address that would be affected by suspension with proper identification
before a Utilities Department employee, either at the Utility Office or at the
service address; or
      (2)   The applicant for the suspension certifies that the service address
will be unoccupied during the suspension and that no consumer will be affected
and provides the city with a copy of a written notice that has been provided to
the occupant of the unit at least 24 hours before the suspension notifying the
occupants of the proposed suspension.
   (D)   If the Suspension Request is not signed by an adult consumer residing
at each service address that would be affected by the suspension, the water
division employee who suspends service shall visit each affected service
address and verify that it is vacant. Verification shall be made by conducting
and documenting a reasonable investigation which includes a thorough inspection
of the interior of the premises. Documentation of the reasonable investigation
must affirmatively state whether the employee found the affected premises to be
vacant and the facts observed by the employee which support that conclusion,
together with any facts that tend to indicate that the premises might still be
occupied. The customer requesting the suspension must grant access to the
premises to the Utilities Department employee for the purpose of conducting
said investigation at the time of suspension.
   (E)   A copy of the Suspension Request shall be retained in the city's
business records relating to any service address so affected. The city shall
restore service suspended for the purpose of non-emergency repair upon the
demand of the customer or owner or of an adult consumer residing at any service
address so affected.
§ 51.44 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The terms TERMINATION or TERMINATE, as they are used in this section,
may refer either to:
      (1)   Termination of a customer's contractual responsibility for water
service through transfer of an account from one customer to another; or
      (2)   Actual termination of water service to any service address at the
request of the customer.
   (B)   All requests for voluntary termination shall be made at the Utilities
Department in writing on a Voluntary Termination form by the customer
contractually obligated to pay charges incurred at each service address
affected by the termination.
   (C)   If the customer requesting termination states on the Voluntary
Termination form that any affected service address is occupied, the termination
will not occur until the Voluntary Termination form is also signed at the
Utility Office or at the service address by an adult consumer actually residing
at each affected service address. Each such consumer shall provide proper
identification to a Utilities Department employee at the time the form is
signed.
   (D)   If the customer requesting termination states on the Voluntary
Termination form that all affected service addresses are vacant but the city
records reveal that any affected service address is different from the billing
address, or there is any other reason to believe the termination may affect
water service to a benefitted unit other than, or in addition to, the
customer's benefitted unit, termination will not occur until a Notice of
Voluntary Termination indicating the date on which the termination will occur
is delivered to each affected service address at least 10 days prior to
termination. Termination shall not occur if the city learns or is notified that
any of the affected service addresses is occupied.
   (E)   Whenever a Notice of Voluntary Termination is required to be sent by
this section, termination will not occur until the Utilities Department
employee assigned to perform the termination personally visits each affected
service address and verifies that it is vacant. Verification shall be made by
conducting and documenting a reasonable investigation which includes a thorough
inspection of the interior of the premises. Documentation of the reasonable
investigation must affirmatively state whether the employee found the affected
premises to be vacant and the facts observed by the employee which support that
conclusion, together with any facts that tend to indicate that the premises
might still be occupied. The customer requesting the termination must grant
access to the premises to the Utilities Department employee for the purpose of
conducting said investigation at the time of termination.
   (F)   Utilities Department employee notations as to this reasonable
investigation, and all request forms and/or notices executed under this
provision, shall be retained in the business file kept by the city relating to
any service address so affected.
   (G)   The city shall restore service immediately upon demand of any adult
consumer of water service at any service address so affected, without charge,
if this voluntary termination provision was not complied with or if the city's
verification of vacancy was in error.
§ 51.45 TERMINATION PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Except for emergency terminations pursuant to §
51.43 above, terminations of water service shall not occur on any day which
precedes a holiday or weekend, or any other day on which all services necessary
to restore service are not available. All terminations of service shall be
documented by a written service order recording the date, time, and identity of
the utilities department employee effectuating termination; such documentation
shall be retained in the business file kept by the city relating to any service
address so affected.
   (B)   Utilities department employees dispatched to terminate service shall
not terminate service until they make reasonable efforts to personally contact
the occupants, if any, of each service address affected by termination to
advise of the termination; and verify the propriety of the termination.
Reasonable efforts shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, knocking
at the entry to each individual service address, or otherwise attempting to
gain the attention of any occupants. If the utilities department employee makes
personal contact with the occupants of any such service address, and discovers
no information which would create a question as to the propriety of the
termination, the utilities department employee shall then deliver to the
occupant a turn-off notice which shall clearly and conspicuously advise the
occupant of:
      (1)   The date and time of the termination;
      (2)   The reason for termination;
      (3)   If the termination is for non-payment, the amount which must be
paid, including any reconnection fee, to have service restored;
      (4)   The location and hours of the office at which payment can be made
to obtain restoration;
      (5)   The title, address, telephone number, and hours during which the
Utility Billing Office may be contacted to discuss restoration of service;
      (6)   A consumer's ability to obtain utility service in their own
account, if service was terminated due to non-payment of utility charges, if
the consumer does not owe an outstanding bill to the Utility Billing Office;
and
      (7)   A consumer or customer's right to a hearing to contest termination
or a refusal to restore service, although that request will not now postpone
termination unless it can be established that prior notice of proposed
termination was not given.
   (C)   If the utilities department employee's efforts to make personal
contact with the occupants of any such service address immediately prior to
termination are not successful, the utilities department employee shall post
the turn-off notice in a prominent place at the entry to each service address
affected by termination. The utilities department employee shall document on
the service order the efforts made to personally contact the occupants prior to
termination and the delivery of the turn-off notice, including the date and
time such acts were performed and their identity.
(Ord. 15-99, passed 2-22-99)
§ 51.46 HEARING PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Utility Office Manager.
      (1)   The Utility Office Manager is the initial contact person for any
person who has a question or dispute about: application disputes; a termination
or proposed termination; a billing question; payment requirements; or other
department requirements for obtaining or maintaining water service. The staff
of the Utilities Department shall refer all such questions and disputes
directly to the Utility Office Manager. The city will, in good faith, take all
steps necessary to ensure that the Utility Office Manager does not limit,
interfere with, or discourage in any way the opportunity or right to request a
hearing before the Utilities Director. Those steps will at a minimum include:
      (a)   Whenever the Utility Office Manager responds to a question or
dispute concerning termination or proposed termination, a billing dispute, a
payment requirement, or other department requirement for obtaining or
maintaining water service, the Utility Office Manager shall advise the person
presenting the question or dispute of the following at the time the Utility
Office Manager gives his or her response:
   IF I HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS MATTER TO YOUR SATISFACTION, YOU STILL HAVE A
RIGHT TO A HEARING BEFORE THE UTILITIES DIRECTOR.
The Utility Office Manager will give the statement orally if his/her response
is given orally, whether in person or by telephone, and shall give the
statement in writing if his/her response is given in writing.
      (b)   Pursuant to this section, a hearing request is made whenever a
person notifies either the Utility Office Manager or the Utilities Director, or
their representatives, orally or in writing, that the person disagrees with the
Utility Office Manager's response or requests a hearing or appeal. If the
Utility Office Manager receives an oral hearing request, the Utility Office
Manager shall promptly reduce that request to writing and shall immediately
forward it to the Utilities Director for hearing.
   (B)   The Hearing.
      (1)   Customers or consumers of utility service who wish to contest
Utilities Department decision, billing, denial of service, or a proposed
termination of utility services shall be afforded a due process opportunity to
contest the city's decision, billing, denial of service, or proposed
termination of utility services, prior to termination of service. Due process
shall include the right to a face-to-face meeting with the Utilities Director
at which time a person appealing may have the assistance of a representative;
and may present documentary and oral information for consideration. Persons
appealing shall be entitled to reasonable access to city business records
concerning the affected service address in order to prepare for the meeting,
including the right to obtain copies of documents upon payment of the actual
cost of copying.
      (2)   The Utilities Director and the Utility Office Manager are
empowered, when good cause is shown, to approve applications for service;
compromise and adjust billings; negotiate, defer and compromise disputes as to
payment demands; and to cancel termination and/or order restoration. The
Utilities Director and the Utility Office Manager shall strive to make
reasonable arrangements to provide water service; arrange reasonable alternate
methods of payment, or reasonable security for payment in order to preserve
utility service, and shall supply and maintain residential utility service
without discrimination. The Director shall preside at hearings held pursuant to
these rules. If the Utilities Director was involved in the original decision at
issue, the Public Safety Director shall have the authority and responsibility
otherwise granted to the Utilities Director in this section.
      (3)   The Utilities Director shall make a written decision after the
hearing, which shall include the information presented at the hearing and the
reasons for the decision. A copy of the decision shall be delivered to the
person appealing and a copy retained in the business files kept by the city
relating to any service address affected by the hearing.
      (4)   Due process hearings shall be held within a reasonable time after
receipt by the city of a verbal or written hearing request. Five business days
shall generally constitute a reasonable time. The city shall provide the person
notice of the time and place of the hearing at least one full business day in
advance of the hearing. The city shall grant a consumer's request for a
continuance of the hearing for a period not to exceed ten business days. The
hearing decision shall be sent to the person within a reasonable time after the
hearing. If a hearing has been requested prior to actual termination of
service, no termination may occur until seven days after the hearing decision
is sent to the person appealing.
§ 51.47 NON-DISCRIMINATION AGAINST CONSUMERS.
   (A)   If service is terminated, or if termination is proposed, due a
customer's non-payment of service charges for a consumer benefitted unit, an
adult consumer of water services in said benefitted unit shall have the right
to avoid termination or obtain restoration of service, if the consumer pays the
current month's charges, the standard residential deposit required to initiate
water service, and assumes responsibility for timely payment of future charges
for service provided the benefitted unit at the service address. If the
consumer demonstrates that they are indigent (i.e., unable to pay the entire
amount of the deposit and the current month's charges without substantial
hardship), the deposit may be made through installment payments over a period
not exceed 120 days. Consumer assumption does not relieve the customer of
contractual liability for charges incurred. The assumption obligation shall
terminate upon the delivery to the city of a written notice canceling that
assumption signed by the consumer who assumed the obligation and by the
customer. If the outstanding charges which caused the proposed termination are
still outstanding, the city may proceed to terminate service without further
notice.
   (B)   This section does not apply to any customer concerning any service
address in which resides the customer obligated for payment of the account for
that service address. However, in circumstances in which one meter serves more
than one service address, consumer benefitted units will not be penalized in
any way, or denied the benefit of this provision, because the defaulting
customer's benefitted unit might also benefit from a continuation or
restoration of service.
§ 51.48 RESTORATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   If water service has been terminated or suspended, service shall not
be restored unless some responsible adult is available at each service address
to be restored to ensure that restoration will not cause damage to the
premises.
   (B)   The city shall restore service suspended for the purpose of non-
emergency repairs upon the demand of the customer or owner, or of an adult
consumer residing at any service address so affected without charge. The city
may assess a reasonable charge against the person or entity requesting services
related to the suspension of service for the purpose of non-emergency repairs.
The city shall restore service suspended for the purpose of emergency repairs
once all hazards are eliminated, without charge.
   (C)   In the case of a voluntary termination of water service, in the event
the city failed to comply with the procedures set forth in §
51.44 above, or if the city's verification of vacancy was in error, the city
will restore service upon demand of any adult consumer of water service at the
service address so affected, without charge.
   (D)   In the case of an involuntary termination, in the event the city
failed to comply with the procedures set forth in §§
51.41,
51.42,
51.45 and
51.46 above, or if the city's termination of service was in error, the city
will restore service upon demand of any adult consumer of water service at the
service address so affected, without charge.
   (E)   In the case of a proper termination in compliance with the procedures
set forth in §§
51.41,
51.42,
51.45 and
51.46, the consumer can obtain restoration of service, if the consumer pays the
current month's charges, and the standard residential deposit required to
initiate water service, and assumes responsibility for timely future charges
for service provided the benefitted unit at the service address, as set forth
in §
51.47 above.
   (F)   The Utilities Director and the Utility Office Manager are empowered to
order restoration when good cause is otherwise shown.
§ 51.49 APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE.
   (A)   Every applicant for water service whose application is denied advised
of that denial by delivery to them of a completed Denial of Service form.
Delivery shall be made personally at the time of application if the application
is made in person, or by ordinary mail to the address listed in the application
within one business day after the application is received, if the application
is made by telephone. Persons whose applications are denied have all of the
hearing rights set forth in §
51.46 above.
   (B)   The only grounds for which an application for water service can be
denied are that:
      (1)   The premises to be served require specified repairs before water
service can be safely provided; or
      (2)   The applicant owes the city an outstanding bill for prior water
service under an account established in the applicant's name. However, no
application can be denied for this reason if the applicant tenders payment for
the prior account.
   (C)   No application for water service may be delayed or denied because of
the credit worthiness of or any bill owed by any person other than the
applicant, including but not limited to the owner of the premises to be served,
the applicant's landlord, or other persons who may live at the premises to be
served.
§ 51.50 OWNER AND LESSEE LIABLE FOR CHARGES.
   The owner of private property which is served by the waterworks system by
pipes connected with the system to convey water thereto, shall as well as the
lessee of the premises be liable to the city for all water from the system used
upon those premises.
(`63 Code, § 915.08) (Ord. 3-78, passed 2-6-78; Am. Ord. 59-82, passed 6-28-82)
§ 51.51 MINIMUM BILLING FOR MULTIPLE DWELLING UNIT: NOTICE OF LOCATION AND
NUMBER OF UNITS.
   (A)   The minimum billing for a multiple dwelling unit shall be the minimum
billing for a dwelling unit multiplied by the number of dwelling units. If
water usage exceeds the minimum usage allowed for the number of dwelling units
in the multiple dwelling unit, the billing for excess water shall be calculated
at the regular rate.
   (B)   Owners of multiple dwelling units shall notify the Municipal Utilities
Department of the location of the multiple dwelling units and the number of
dwelling units contained therein. This notice shall be in writing and shall be
given within thirty days of the acquisition of a multiple dwelling unit. In the
event that the owner of a multiple dwelling unit notifies the Municipal
Utilities Department in writing that one of his units will have no water usage
for a period of ninety days or more, then no charge shall be made for that unit
during the period in which no water is being used. In the event, however, that
the owner fails to notify the Municipal Utilities Department in writing as to
the date of resumption of water usage in that unit and water is actually being
used in that unit, then the owner shall be responsible for the payment of water
for that unit for the entire period of claimed non-use, based upon the previous
year's average quarterly bill. In addition, therefore, there shall be a penalty
of ten percent of the amount of the bill for the period of claimed non-use.
   (C)   Violation of division (B) shall constitute a minor misdemeanor.
(Ord. 3-78, passed 2-6-78; Am. Ord. 41-79, passed 6-18-79; Am. Ord. 59-82,
passed 6-28-82; Am. Ord. 62-90, passed 9-10-90)
Penalty, see § 51.99
§ 51.52 DEPOSIT.
   (A)   A water guarantee deposit of $60 shall be charged for the following:
      (1)   New property owners who have not had water service established with
the city.
      (2)   All tenant/renters whether water service has been established or
not.
   (B)   Deposit shall be waived under the following condition: A letter of
credit from previous water utility services.
   (C)   The water guarantee deposit is a non-interest bearing deposit.
Property owners' deposits shall be refunded after one year if all bills are
paid by the due date. Tenants/renters/land contractors' deposits shall be held/
applied to the final billing. No final bill refunds of less than $1 shall be
refunded.

passed 3-11-02; Am. Ord. 13-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 51.53 COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT WATER RENTS.
   Notification of court action and/or lien filing shall be sent by the
utilities department to the property owner and tenant if applicable when
billing becomes delinquent. Thirty days after notification is sent and the bill
remains unpaid, the city shall proceed with collection action by any means
allowed by law.
(Ord. 62-90, passed 9-10-90; Am. Ord. 15-99, passed 2-22-99)
§ 51.54 BACKFLOW PREVENTION.
   (A)   If, in the judgment of the Utilities Director, an approved backflow
prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water system, the
Utilities Director will give notice to the water consumer to install such an
approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his own expense,
install such an approved device at a location and in a manner approved by the
Utilities Director and shall have inspections and test made of such approved
devices as required by the Utilities Director.
   (B)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply of the city may enter the supply
or distributing system of the city, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency
water supply and the method of connection and use of such supply shall have
been approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Utilities
Director and any other necessary governmental authority.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Utilities Director to cause surveys to be
made of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where
actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys
and investigations shall be mad a matter of public record and shall be repeated
as often as the Utilities Director shall deem necessary.
   (D)   The Utilities Director or his or her duly authorized representative
shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any property served by a
connection to the public water supply or distribution system of the city for
the purpose of inspecting the piping system or systems thereof. On demand the
owner, lessees or occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the
Utilities Director any information which he may request regarding the piping
system or systems of water us on such property. The refusal of such
information, when demanded, shall, within the discretion of the Utilities
Director, be deemed evidence of improper connections as provided in this
section.
   (E)   The Utilities Director is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such conditions have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the
provisions of this section.

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (A)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
is permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         (a)   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         (b)   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         (b)   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (B)   Steady yellow signal indication.

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (C)(1), (C)(2), and (C)
(3) of this section.
         (b)   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         (b)   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

      (1)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   (a)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing
a flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination
with another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such
movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same
time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or
making a u-turn, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         (b)   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (F)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (G)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (H)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (B)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (C)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (D)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.

“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (A)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (B)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (C)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

having obtained a driver’s license.

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in R.C. § 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (B)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (A)(1) or (A)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (C)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
130.99 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §
130.99(G)(1)(b)1. and R.C. § 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up to
$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
130.99(F)(1)(c) and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (D)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance.
   (E)   If the offender is sentenced under division (C)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of R.C. § 4510.12, this section, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
(R.C. § 4510.12)
§ 71.24 DRIVING UNDER OVI SUSPENSION.
   (A)   No person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege has been suspended under R.C. § 4511.19,

section, driving under OVI suspension is a misdemeanor of the first degree. The
court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         (a)   A mandatory jail term of three consecutive days. The three-day
term shall be imposed, unless, subject to division (C) of this section, the
court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 30 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall
the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense exceed six months;
         (b)   A fine of not less than $250 and not more than $1,000;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;
         (d)   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender's name, immobilization for 30 days of the
offender's vehicle and impoundment for 30 days of the identification license
plates of that vehicle. The order for immobilization and impoundment shall be
issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section or one
equivalent offense, driving under OVI suspension is a misdemeanor of the first
degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 10 consecutive days. Notwithstanding
the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 through 2929.28, the court may
sentence the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The 10-
day mandatory jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to division (C) of
this section, the court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90
consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of
house arrest with electronic monitoring shall not exceed one year;
         (b)   Notwithstanding the fines provided for in R.C. Chapter 2929, a
fine of not less than $500 and not more than $2,500;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;
         (d)   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender's name, immobilization of the offender's
vehicle for 60 days and the impoundment for 60 days of the identification
license plates of that vehicle. The order for immobilization and impoundment
shall be issued and enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under OVI suspension is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         (a)   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days. Notwithstanding
the jail terms provided in R.C. §§ 2929.21 through 2929.28, the court may
sentence the offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The
court shall not sentence the offender to a term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring in lieu of the mandatory portion of the jail term;
         (b)   Notwithstanding the fines set forth in R.C. Chapter 2929, a fine
of not less than $500 and not more than $2,500;
         (c)   A license suspension under division (E) of this section;
         (d)   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender's name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender's vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle that
is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned
or transferred and R.C. § 4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, the court may fine
the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so imposed
shall be distributed in accordance with division R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (C)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (B)(1) or (B)(2) of this section
unless, within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following
the date of sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that
period.
   (D)   Fifty percent of any fine imposed by a court under division (B)(1),
(B)(2), or (B)(3) of this section shall be deposited into the municipal
indigent drivers alcohol treatment fund under the control of that court, as
created by the municipality pursuant to R.C. § 4511.191(H).
   (E)   In addition to or independent of all other penalties provided by law
or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor's
court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender's driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
      (1)   When permitted as specified in R.C. § 4510.021, if the court grants
limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this section, the
privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the offender must
display restricted license plates, issued under R.C. § 4503.231, on the vehicle
driven subject to the privileges, except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
R.C. § 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from holding
a commercial driver's license under R.C. § 4506.16 shall be issued a driver's
license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the commercial
driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person whose
commercial driver's license is suspended under this section shall be issued a
driver's license under R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period of the suspension.
   (F)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
130.99(G) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the offense that is a misdemeanor of the first degree under this
section for which the offender is sentenced.

      ELECTRONIC MONITORING has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2929.01.
      EQUIVALENT OFFENSE means any of the following:
         (a)   A violation of a municipal ordinance, law of another state, or
law of the United States that is substantially equivalent to division (A) of
this section;
         (b)   A violation of a former law of this state that was substantially
equivalent to division (A) of this section.
      JAIL has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2929.01.
      MANDATORY JAIL TERM means the mandatory term in jail of 3, 10, or 30
consecutive days that must be imposed under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3)
of this section upon an offender convicted of a violation of division (A) of

         (a)   Except as specifically authorized under this section, the term
must be served in a jail.
         (b)   Except as specifically authorized under this section, the term
cannot be suspended, reduced, or otherwise modified pursuant to any provision
of the Ohio Revised Code.
(R.C. § 4510.14)
   (H)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

be operated by another person in the municipality, during the period of the
suspension or cancellation, except as specifically authorized by R.C. Chapter

responsibility is maintained with respect to that vehicle.
   (B)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any public
or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking in this municipality if the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s

judgment.
   (C)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may be admitted into evidence
as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (A) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time
of the alleged violation of division (B) of this section. The person charged
with a violation of division (A) or (B) of this section may offer evidence to
rebut this prima facie evidence.
   (D)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of driving

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §
130.99(E) or R.C. § 2929.26; notwithstanding §

to §
130.99(F)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously was
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section, or
any combination of two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or
4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for
which the offender is sentenced under this section.

permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

section that the order of suspension resulted from the failure of the alleged
offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under R.C. § 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial financial
responsibility random verification request, the alleged offender was in
compliance with R.C. § 4509.101(A)(1) as shown by proof of financial

operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7).
(R.C. § 4510.21)

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (D)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (E)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on

attending programs offered by community boards of mental health and county
boards of developmental disabilities are loading or unloading at curbside or at

driver of a vehicle need not stop for a school bus approaching from the
opposite direction which has stopped for the purpose of receiving or
discharging any school child, persons attending programs offered by community
boards of mental health and county boards of developmental disabilities, or
children attending programs offered by head start agencies. The driver of any
vehicle overtaking the school bus shall comply with division (A) above.

more traffic lanes shall receive and discharge all school children, persons
attending programs offered by community boards of mental health and county

   (E)   No school bus driver shall start the driver's bus until after any
child, person attending programs offered by community boards of mental health
and county boards of developmental disabilities, or child attending a program
offered by a head start agency who may have alighted therefrom has reached a
place of safety on the child's or person's residence side of the road.
   (F)   (1)   Whoever violates division (A) of this section may be fined an
amount not to exceed $500. A person who is issued a citation for a violation of

and waive the person’s right to contest the citation in a trial but instead
must appear in person in the proper court to answer the charge.
      (2)   In addition to and independent of any other penalty provided by
law, the court or mayor may impose upon an offender who violates this section a
class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. § 4510.02(A)(7). When a
license is suspended under this section, the court or mayor shall cause the
offender to deliver the license to the court, and the court or clerk of the
court immediately shall forward the license to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
together with notice of the court’s action.

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         (b)   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (A) or
(B) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of

regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (A)(1)(b), (A)(1)
(c), (A)(1)(d) and (A)(1)(e) of this section or less than the applicable
concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance specified for a violation of division (A)(1)(j) of this
section, that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This division does not
limit or affect a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (B) of this
section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (D)(1)(b) of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under § 73.02, shall state that the person may
have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude
the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.

abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (D)(4)(b) of this section.

of evidence, a report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (E)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of

         ALCOHOL MONITORING DEVICE. Means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing

      (2)   Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or
private property used by the public for vehicular travel or parking within this
municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have
given consent to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine if

shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control

      (4)   Any person who is dead or unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have
consented as provided in division (A)(2) of this section, and the test or tests
may be administered, subject to R.C. §§ 313.12 through 313.16.
      (5)   (a)   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (d),
or (e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (C) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (A)(3) and (A)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         (b)   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (A)(5)(a) of this section, the law enforcement
officer who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to
this division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
   (B)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, the arresting
law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with this section to

73.021, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
division (C) of this section and shall read the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest
and read to the person by the arresting officer. One or more persons shall
witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall
certify to this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the
chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer,
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does
not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to
submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (A)(5) of this section, if a person is
under arrest as described in division (B) of this section, before the person
may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the following form
to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of OVI or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state OVI, and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state OVI.”
   “(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
   (D)   If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in division (B) of this section or division (A)(5) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it
to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the
arrested person is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is
not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it
to the law enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after
the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
   (E)   (1)   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (A)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (B) of this section
to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, if
the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of the
consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the person
refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of §
73.021, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
person submits to the test or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting officer
shall do all of the following:
         (a)   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30 days after that
initial appearance;
         (b)   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
         (c)   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
         (d)   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
            1.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for being
in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
            3.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that the
officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the form
described in division (C) of this section;
            4.   Unless division (E)(1)(d)5. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            5.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (A)(5)
of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
      (2)   Division (E)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of §
73.021, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (F)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
   (G)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197 relative to any
suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.

time at which the arresting officer serves the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s being requested to take the chemical test
or tests under division (A) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (2)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of §
73.01(A) or (B), R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other municipal OVI
ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of §
73.021 or R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. §
4511.191(B) or (C) or R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the
charge resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’
arrest or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any
continuance granted by the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the
issues specified in that section.

section.
      (2)   The Department of Transportation upon request from any local
authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of
any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if
it finds that such structure cannot with safety withstand traffic travelling at
the speed otherwise permissible under this Traffic Code, the Department shall
determine and declare the maximum speed of traffic which such structure can
withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating such maximum speed
to be erected and maintained at a distance of a least 100 feet before each end
of the structure.
      (3)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this
section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by the Department and
the existence of such signs shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure.

issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
   (I)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

“statement of gross vehicle weight” showing the gross weight of the vehicle
including the cargo on the vehicle, the name and address of the person issuing
the statement, and the date and place where the vehicle and its cargo were
weighed. The driver or operator of the commercial car, trailer or semitrailer
shall retain such statement of gross vehicle weight on his or her person, and
any law enforcement officer may request that such driver or operator exhibit it
to him or her. If, upon examining the statement of gross vehicle weight, the
law enforcement officer has reason to believe that the information contained
therein is correct in every respect, he or she shall indorse it with his or her
name and the date and place where it was exhibited to him or her. The law
enforcement officer may then permit such driver or operator to proceed without
weighing by a law enforcement officer. No person shall willfully issue a
written statement of gross vehicle weight and knowingly give any false
information in such statement.

§ 74.58 WEIGHING OF VEHICLE; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   (A)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded.
   (B)   The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped.
   (C)   Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the
police officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as
prescribed by this section.
   (D)   All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and its
load shall be annually compared by a municipal, county or state sealer with the
state standards or standards approved by the state, and the scales shall not be
sealed if they do not conform to the state standards or standards approved by
the state.
   (E)   At each end of a permanently installed scale, there shall be a
straight approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and
width to insure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scales, specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on a level terrain of sufficient length and
width to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. Such terrain shall be
level, or if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in
elevation between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between such axles.
   (F)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determining the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, 12 feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one such scale under the
outside wheel of each such axle. In determinations of gross weight by the use
of compact, self- contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to
determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed
simultaneously by placing one such scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (G)   Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines that
the weight is unlawful, he or she may require the driver to stop the vehicle in
a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed
as is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted
under R.C. §§ 5577.01 through 5577.14 and this chapter.

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (B)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in R.C. § 2307.011, in a tort action
that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.
Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         (a)   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         (b)   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         (c)   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (G)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (B)(1) of this section shall be fined

   GOLF CART. A motor vehicle as that term is defined in R.C. § 4501.01(B).
Golf carts are a type of under speed vehicle (USV). A USV is a four- wheeled
vehicle other than a truck that is originally designed and constructed with a
top attainable speed of 20 miles per hour or less and is not originally
designed or constructed for operation on a street or highway. A USV may not be
operated on a public street or highway unless it complies with all requirements
of R.C. Chapter 4513, and the requirements of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cambridge, Ohio.
   INSPECTION. Means the same that is required by O.A.C. 4501:2-1-01 through

of a vehicle.
   PROOF OF FINANCIAL RESPONS- IBILITY. Has the same meaning as set forth in

   (B)   The inspection must be prearranged with the Chief of Police or his
designee.
   (C)   The owner of any golf cart shall be required to pay an inspection fee
of $25. This inspection fee shall be deposited into the General Fund. If the
Chief of Police or his designee determines that the golf cart complies with the
State of Ohio statutory requirements that are applicable to motor vehicles, the
Chief of Police or his designee shall issue the owner a certificate of
compliance entitling the owner to register, apply for the title and purchase
license plates for the vehicle. The owner must also show the Chief of Police or
his designee a valid Ohio operator’s license (driver’s license) and proof of
financial responsibility for the golf cart before the certificate of compliance
is issued.
   (D)   Golf carts that have been inspected shall display a sticker that will
be provided by the Police Department on the rear of the cart in a conspicuous
location. Officers may stop a golf cart that is operated on the streets of the

the operator has a valid operator’s license (driver’s license), a valid

insurance if the operator fails to show proof of such upon being lawfully
stopped.
   (B)   No person shall operate a golf cart on any state highway within the
city. Moreover, no person shall operate a golf cart on any city street in the
city where the posted speed limit exceeds 25 miles per hour. Operators may

all times, on the seat of the golf cart and wearing a seat belt when the golf
cart is in motion. Standing on any portion of the golf cart when it is in
motion is prohibited. An officer who observes any operator or rider not wearing
a seat belt has probable cause to stop the golf cart and the parties on board.
   (D)   Operators of golf carts shall comply with all other local and state
laws pertaining to motor vehicles upon public highways.

      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         (a)   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         (b)   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (C). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.

attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (B)(4) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of
whether the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather
than a dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be
required to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the
Ohio Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog,
as applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the
pendency of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (C), or on
appeal as described in this division (C), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.54
and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section apply with respect to the dog
and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous
dog, and R.C. § 955.54 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a
dangerous dog, and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those
provisions apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in
that manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper,
or harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under division (B)(5)(a)
in an amount described in division (D)(4)(b) of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (C), NUISANCE DOG, DANGEROUS DOG, and
VICIOUS DOG have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.
(R.C. § 955.222)
   (D)   Penalty.

more than $100 on a first offense, and on each subsequent offense shall be
fined not less than $75 or more than $250 and may be imprisoned for not more

section that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the
first offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent

guilty to a third violation of division (B)(3) of this section involving the
same dog, the court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as
a dangerous dog.
         (b)   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (D)(2)(a) of
this section, if a violation of division (B)(3) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.

the alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a
licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at
the owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final
determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that
division and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or
restrained in accordance with division (B)(4) of this section or at the county
dog pound at the owner’s expense.

section that involves a vicious dog is guilty of one of the following:
            1.   A felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law if the

            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         (b)   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed
under division (D)(4)(a)2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that R.C. § 955.54 and divisions (B)(4) to (B)(9) of this section
apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as
if the dog were a dangerous dog and that R.C. § 955.54 applies with respect to
the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall
order the offender to obtain the liability insurance required under division
(B)(5)(a) of this section in an amount, exclusive of interest and costs, that
equals or exceeds $100,000. Until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of division (B)(3) of this
section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or

§ 92.06 PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
90 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state: The name and address of the person
aggrieved; the name and address of the person against whom the complaint is
filed; a description and the address of the dwelling, which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice; a concise statement of the facts,
including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged discriminatory housing
practice, and such other information as may be required by the Board. The
complaint may be reasonable and fairly amended. The Board may also corroborate
or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or
volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (B)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the secretary of the Board shall make
such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. Such
investigation shall be conducted within 14 business days after the filing of
the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed necessary by the
chairman of the Fair Housing Board. If the secretary determines that there are
reasonable grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to
conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all
interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist
them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done
during such initial conferences shall be made public by any member of the Board
or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (C)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent agreements shall
be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (D)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the State
Real Estate Commission, State Civil Rights Commission, or the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matter before the Board.
   (E)   If the secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or order such
further investigation as may be necessary; provided that the Board shall not
dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity to
appear before the Board.
   (F)   If the secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, he shall so notify the Board and the Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon all interested parties
a notice of the time and place of such hearing. The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing
shall be opened to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than 15
calendar days nor more than 30 calendar days after the service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which record shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (G)   (1)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings and cause the Law Director to
prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board upon investigation by the secretary determines that
the person complained against has not after 15 calendar days following service
of the Board's order, complied with the order, the Board will recertify the
matter to the Law Director for enforcement.
      (2)   The Law Director shall seek compliance by appropriate civil action
brought in the name of the Fair Housing Board before a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (H)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so state and publish its
findings and issue its orders dismissing the complaint.

property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such

services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
         (d)   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
divisions (a), (b) and (c) hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the municipality.
            2.   Provided however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the formula provided for herein, the Tax
Administrator, upon application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to
substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a fair and proper
apportionment.
   (C)   Sales made in a municipal corporation.  As used in division (B) of
this section, SALES MADE IN A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION means:

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of, tangible personal property shipped from a place
within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales

section, net profit from rental activity not constituting a business or
profession shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which
the property generating the net profit is located.

residents of the municipality and, except as otherwise provided in § 718.01 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the municipality may impose a tax on all income earned
by residents of the municipality to the extent allowed by the United States
Constitution.
   (F)   Net operating loss (NOL).
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year,
beginning with the year 2003, apportioned to the municipality may be applied
against the portion of the profit of succeeding tax years apportioned to the
municipality, until exhausted, but in no event for more than the three taxable
years immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of
a net operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior
year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be apportioned
to the municipality in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning net
profits to the municipality.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carryforward shall be determined.
      (4)   The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal identity,
by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as a carry-
forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.

deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided in
division (1). However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business
activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another municipality) may be used to offset
the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.

      (1)   A consolidated return may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for Federal income tax purposes pursuant
to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. A consolidated return must
include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless the
applicable requirements of the Rules and Regulations for discontinuing the
filing of consolidated returns have been met.
      (3)   In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, the Tax Administrator shall
require such information, in addition to the return hereinafter provided for,
as he may deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly
allocated to the municipality. If the Tax Administrator finds net profits are
not properly allocated to the municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates, or some other method, they may require the filing of
a consolidated return or adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the municipality.
   (H)   Capital gains and losses. After the determination of net profits, but
before the imposition of the tax imposed by this subchapter, there shall be
eliminated from such net profits all capital gains and losses.
   (I)   Gains and loss from sale or exchange of assets. Net profits which are
subject to the tax imposed by this subchapter shall include all gains or losses

   (A)   Universal filing. On or before April 15th of each year, every resident
subject to the provisions of this subchapter shall, except hereinafter
provided, make and file with the Tax Administrator a municipal tax return on a
form prescribed by and acceptable to the Tax Administrator, whether or not a
tax is due. When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period different
from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or period. The
Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to provide by regulation that the return
of an employer or employers, showing the amount of municipal tax deducted by
said employer or employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation, and other taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by
him or them to the Tax Administrator may be accepted as the return required of
a nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code,
is such qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable
income.
   (B)   Filing with spouse. A husband and wife may file either separate
returns or a joint return for municipal purposes, even though one of the
spouses has neither taxable income nor deductions included on the municipal
return regardless of whether their federal and state returns were filed
separately or jointly. If a joint city return is made, the tax shall be
computed on the aggregate taxable income and the liability with respect to the
tax shall be joint and several.
   (C)   Returns and content thereof. The return shall be filed with the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall accept a generic form of any return,
report or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and
filed contains all of the information required to be submitted with the city
prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the rules or
ordinances of the city governing the filing of returns, reports or documents.
The determination as to whether a generic form meets the criteria above shall
be within the sole discretion of the Tax Administrator. The return shall set
forth the following information:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this tax code on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules or other information as the Tax
Administrator may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this
subchapter, as attachments.
   (D)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a municipal Income
Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request with
the Municipal Tax Division.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing a municipal income tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension must be filed on or before the original
due date for the annual return.
      (4)   If the request is granted, the extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the last day of the month following the month to
which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The city may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if the
taxpayer:
         (a)   Fails to timely file the request;
         (b)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request;
         (c)   Owes the city any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or any other charge for the late payment or the nonpayment
of income tax; or
         (d)   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by §
95.04. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed
and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other filing
and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by the
Tax Administrator shall be granted upon the condition that declaration filing
and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
    (E)   Payment with returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return, shall at the time of the filing
thereof pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been
deducted at the source pursuant to the provisions of §
95.06 of this subchapter; or where any portion of the tax shall have been paid
by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of §
95.07 of this subchapter, or where an income tax creditable against the
municipal tax pursuant to §
95.15 of this subchapter has been paid to another municipality, credit for the
amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in §
95.05, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
municipality is entitled under the provisions of this subchapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1 shall be

§ 95.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Withholding by employer.
      (1)   Each employer within, or doing business within the municipality who
employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other
compensation basis shall deduct when such salary, wage, commission or other
compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside, the tax at the tax
rate of 1.5% up to and including December 31, 2009, and 2% commencing January
1, 2010 and thereafter of the qualifying wages commissions, or other
compensation due by said employer to each said employee and shall, beginning
with the first quarter of 2002, make a return and pay to the Tax Administrator
the amount of taxes so deducted according to the hereinafter set forth payment
schedule. Said return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefore by the Tax Administrator. Nothing in this section
prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than qualifying
wages.
      (2)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to
an individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at
the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of
the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
      (3)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
      (4)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment
is not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
      (5)   All employers shall make quarterly payments no later than the last
day of the month following each calendar quarter. However, each employer shall
be permitted to remit to the Tax Administrator the taxes he has withheld from
his employees during the immediate preceding month.
      (6)   Payment of taxes withheld by an employer for the municipality
during the measurement period, may be made monthly or quarterly on or before
the last day of the month following the end of each month or quarter, subject
to the approval of the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may revoke the
approval of monthly or quarterly filing and payments whenever the Tax
Administrator has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal
shall be made in writing and, in such case; the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
   (B)   Employer considered as trustee.  Each employer in collecting said tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
municipality, as a Trustee for the benefit of the municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (C)   Corporate officers personal liability. Any person who is required to
withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay all such tax to the municipality
in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the municipality in
accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the
municipality as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also liable
under the provisions of §
95.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (D)   Withholding return; list of employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation (Form W-3) showing the sum total of all
compensation paid all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject
to withholding along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was
subject to withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted.
Said return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Cambridge tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code, and Social
Security number of each employee, the total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of Cambridge tax withheld. If the total tax withheld
from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another municipality,
the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of information to
Cambridge concerning each employee. The withholding tax reconciliation shall be
filed by each employer on or before February 28 following the end of such
calendar year.
   (E)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated, as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the city when the services were performed in the
city. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the
name, address and social security number (or federal identification number),
and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in
lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on or before
February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (F)   Domestic servant. Provided however, that no person shall be required
to withhold the tax on the qualified wages, commissions, other compensation and
other taxable income paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person’s residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible
for filing and paying their own returns and taxes.

no period of limitation on an additional assessment in a return that omits
gross income in excess of 25% of that required to be reported or in the case of
filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in the
case of failure to file a return. In those cases in which the Commissioner of

of limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Tax Administrator shall be extended one year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.

extension of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the
rate of interest prescribed by R.C. § 5703.47.
   (D)   Amounts of less than $1 shall not be collected or refunded.

§ 95.15 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Where a resident of the municipality is subject to a municipal income

the same income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality and who
receives salaries, wages, commissions, or other compensation or net profits
from sales made, work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
municipality, if it be made to appear that a municipal income tax has been paid
on such income to another municipality, he shall claim a credit of the amount
of tax paid by him or on his behalf to such municipality, but the credit is

the tax rate of the city.
   (C)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, if tax or
withholding is paid to a municipal corporation on income or wages, and if a
second municipal corporation imposes a tax on that income or wages after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the first
municipal corporation, the second municipal corporation shall allow a
nonrefundable credit, against the tax or withholding the second municipality
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipal corporation with respect to such income
or wages.
   (D)   If the tax rate in the second municipal corporation is less than the
tax rate in the first municipal corporation, then the credit described in
division (C) of this section shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect
in the second municipal corporation.
   (E)   Notwithstanding the provisions contained in §
95.11 hereof, or any other provisions inconsistent herewith, a claim for refund
or credit under this section shall be made in such manner as the Tax
Administrator may provide. No such claim for refund or credit shall be allowed

such taxpayer’s employer files with the Tax Administrator a list showing the
tax withheld from such taxpayer’s wages, salaries, or commissions for other
municipalities.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator shall provide that a resident working in another
municipality imposing a tax on earned income shall not be required to file a
declaration under §
95.07 hereof if the administrator of the income tax of such other municipality
advises the Tax Administrator that a tax rate of 1.5% up to and including
December 31, 2009, and 2% commencing January 1, 2010, and thereafter of the
gross salaries is being deducted from the wages of such resident and is being
paid to such other municipality and if the qualifying wages or other

§ 95.18 IMPOSITION OF TAX; EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Bases.
      (1)   Resident employee.
          (a)   For the purpose of determining the tax on the earnings of
resident taxpayers taxed under §
95.03(A)(1), the sources of the earnings and the place or places in or at which
the services were rendered are immaterial. All such earnings wherever earned or
paid are taxable.
         (b)   The following are items which are subject to the tax imposed by
§
95.03(A)(1):
            1.   Gross salaries, wages, bonuses and incentive payment earned by
an individual whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in
property for services rendered during the tax period as:
               a.   An officer, director or employee of a corporation
(including charitable and other non profit organizations), joint stock
association or joint stock company;
               b.   An employee (as distinguished from a partner or member) of
a partnership, limited partnership or any form of unincorporated enterprise
owned by two or more persons;
               c.   An employee (as distinguished from a proprietor) of a
business, trade or profession conducted by an individual owner;
               d.   An officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of the United States Government, or any of its agencies; or of
the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions or agencies thereof; or
any foreign country or dependency except as provided in §
95.03(F);
               e.   An employee of any other entity or person, whether based
upon hourly, daily, weekly, semi monthly, monthly, annual, unit of production
or piece work rates; and whether paid by an individual, partnership,
association, corporation (including charitable and other non profit
corporations), governmental administration, agency, authority, board, body,
branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit, or any
other entity.
            2.   Commissions earned by an individual directly or through an
agent and whether in cash or in property for services rendered, regardless of
how computed or by whom or where so ever paid.
               a.   If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the
commissions earned, and the excess is not subject to the demand of the employer
for repayment, the tax is payable on the amounts received as a drawing account.
               b.    Amounts received from an employer for expenses, and not as
compensation and used as such by the individual receiving them, are not deemed
to be compensation if the employer deducts such expenses or advances as such
from his gross income for the purpose of determining his net profits taxable
under federal law, and the employee is not required to include such receipts as
income on his federal tax return.
               c.   If commissions are included in the net earnings of the
trade, business, profession, enterprise or activity carried on by an
unincorporated entity of which the individual receiving such commission is
owner or part owner, they shall not be taxed under §
95.03(A)(1).
            3.   Fees, unless such fees are properly includable as part of the
net profits of a trade, business, profession or enterprise regularly carried on
by an unincorporated entity owned or partly owned by said individual.
            4.   Other compensation, including tips, bonuses or gifts of any
type, and including compensation paid to domestic servants, casual employees
and other types of employees.
            5.   Payments made to an employee by an employer as vacation pay or
wages under any other wage continuation plan during periods of disability or
sickness are taxable when paid. Payments made by third parties (insurance
companies) to an employee for sick or disability pay are taxable if the amount
appears on a W-2 form and the employer has paid the premium for this insurance
coverage.
            6.   Sums deducted from gross wages or other compensation for
retirement purposes (deferred compensation) are taxable.
            7.   If the income appears on a W-2 form and is not shown to be an
exception in accordance with division (F) of this section. Exceptions, it shall
be considered other compensation and therefore taxable to the individual. This
includes, but is not limited to:
               a.   Tips, bonuses, fees, gifts in lieu of pay, gratuities.
               b.    Supplemental unemploy-ment pay, severance pay.
               c.    Incentive payments, no matter how described, including,
but not limited to payments to induce early retirement.

               e.    Employer paid group term life insurance premiums to the
extent that they are taxable to the federal government.
               f.   Sick pay whether paid by the employer to the employee or
through a third party.
               g.    Contributions by an employee or on behalf of an employee
from gross wages, into an employee or third party trust or pension plan as
permitted by any provision of the Internal Revenue Code which may be excludable
from gross wages for federal income tax purposes (401K plans and similar
plans).
               h.   The value of employer sponsored plans which permit the
participant to reduce his taxable income for federal tax purposes. Such a
reduction does not cause the gross wage or salary to lose its character as a
gross wage or salary subject to the provisions of §
95.03(A) Basis of Imposition (cafeteria plans and the like).
               i.   The ordinary income portion of a stock option or employee
stock purchase plan to the extent that it is shown on the W-2 as ordinary
income and is includable on the taxpayer’s federal income tax return.
         (c)   Where compensation is paid or received in property, its fair
market value, at the time of receipt, shall be subject to the tax and to
withholding. Board, lodging and similar items received by an employee in lieu
of additional cash compensation shall be included in earnings at their fair
market value. In the case of domestic and other employees whose duties require
them to live at their place of employment or assignment, board, and lodging
shall not be considered as wages or compensation earned.
      (2)   Non resident employee.
          (a)   In the case of individuals who are not residents, there is
imposed under §
95.03(A)(2) a tax on all gross salaries, wages, commissions and other
compensation earned for work done or services
performed or rendered within the municipality whether such compensation or
remuneration is received or earned directly or through an agent and whether
paid in cash or in property. The location of the place from which payment is
made is immaterial.
         (b)   The items subject to tax under §
95.03(A)(2) are the same as those listed and defined respecting a resident
employee.
         (c)   A non-resident individual who works in the city 12 or fewer days
per year shall be considered an itinerant as defined in the general regulations
of this subchapter. However, beginning with the thirteenth day, the itinerant
employee shall be no longer considered to have been an occasional entrant to
the city and the employer shall be required to remit taxes on income earned in
the city by the itinerant employee for the first 12 days thereon.
      (3)   (a)   Imposition of tax on resident unincorporated businesses.
            1.   The tax imposed on resident associations or other
unincorporated entities owned by two or more persons is upon the entities
rather that the individual members or owners thereof, but the tax imposed on an
unincorporated resident entity owned by one person is upon the individual
owner.
            2.   The tax imposed by §
95.03(A)(3) is imposed on all resident unincorporated entities having net
profits attributable to the municipality under the method of allocation
provided for, regardless of where the owner or owners of such resident
unincorporated business entity reside.
            3.   Resident associations or unincorporated entities owned
exclusively by residents of the municipality may elect to disregard the method
of allocation provided for and pay the tax on their entire net profits if no
allocation by the entity to another municipality exists. In such case, the tax
paid by the entity shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members of
the entity for their distributive share of such net profits; however, an
additional return shall be required from any such owner or member having
taxable income other than the distributive share of the net profits from the
entity.
            4.   The tax imposed shall not apply to income derived within the
municipality by any person from interstate commerce if the only business
activities within the state by or on behalf of such person are either or both
of the following.
               a.    Solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative, in the state for sales of tangible personal property, which
orders are sent outside the state for approval or rejection, and, if approved,
are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside the state; and
               b.   The solicitation of orders by such person, or his
representative in the state, in the name of or for the benefit of a prospective
customer of such person, if orders by such customer to such person to enable
such customer to fill orders resulting from such solicitations are orders
described in division (3)4.a. above; provided however, that the provisions of
this subsection shall not apply to any corporation which is incorporated under
the laws of the state or any individual who is domiciled in or a resident of
the state. For the purpose of this subsection a person shall not be considered
to have engaged in a business activity within the state during any taxable year
merely by reason of sales in the state, or the solicitation of orders for sales
within the state, of tangible personal property on behalf of such person by one
or more independent contractors or by reason of the maintenance of an office
within the state by one or more independent contractors whose activities on
behalf of such person in the state consist solely of making sales or soliciting
orders for sales of tangible personal property. For the purpose of this
subsection the term INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR means a commission agent, broker, or
other independent contractor who is engaged in selling or soliciting orders for
sales of tangible personal property for more than one principal and who holds
himself out as such in the regular course of his business activities. For the
purpose of this subsection, the term REPRESENTATIVE does not include an
independent contractor.
         (b)   Imposition of tax on resident’s distributive share of profits of
a resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the municipality.
            1.   A resident individual who is an owner of a resident
unincorporated entity shall pay the tax on his entire share of net profits of
the resident unincorporated business entity unless allocation to another
municipality exists. See §
95.15 for credits.
            2.   In the case of a resident individual partner or part owner of
a resident unincorporated entity, the tax is imposed on such individual’s
distributive share of net profits not attributable to the municipality under
the method of allocation provided for in §
95.03, and not taxed against the entity.
      (4)   (a)   Imposition of tax on nonresident unincorporated businesses.
            1.   In the case of non-resident associations or other
unincorporated entities, whether or not they have an office or any place of
business in the municipality, the tax is imposed on net profits attributable to
the municipality under the method of allocation provided for in §
95.03.
            2.   The tax imposed on non resident associations or other
unincorporated entities is upon the entities rather than the individual owners
thereof.
            3.   The tax imposed by §
95.03(A)(3)a. is imposed on all non- resident associations and other
unincorporated entities having net profits attributable to the municipality
under the method of allocation provided for, regardless of where the owner or
owners of such non resident associations or unincorporated entities reside.
            4.   Non-resident unincorporated entities owned exclusively by
residents of the municipality may elect to disregard the method of allocation
provided for and pay the tax on their entire net profits if no allocation by
the entity to another municipality exists. In such case, the tax paid by the
entity shall constitute all tax due from the owners or members of the entity
for their distributive share of the net profits; however, a return shall be
required from such owner or member having taxable income other than the
distributive share of the net profits from the entity.
         (b)   Imposition of tax on resident’s share of profits of a non
resident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the municipality.
            1.   A resident individual who is an owner of a non-resident
unincorporated business entity shall pay the tax on his entire share of net
profits of the unincorporated entity, unless allocation to another municipality
exists.
            2.   In the case of a resident individual partner or part owner of
a non resident unincorporated entity, the tax is imposed on such individual’s
distributive share of net profits not attributable to the municipality under
the method of allocation provided for in §
95.03, and not taxed against the entity.
      (5)   Imposition of tax on corporations.
         (a)   In the case of corporations, including S Corporations, whether
domestic or foreign and whether or not such corporations have an office or
place of business in the municipality, the tax is imposed on the net profits
attributable to the municipality under the formula or separate accounting
method provided for.
         (b)   In determining whether a corporation is conducting a business or
other activity in the municipality, the provisions of these regulations shall
be applicable.
         (c)   Corporations which are required by the provisions of Ohio R.C.
§§ 5727.33 to 5727.41, inclusive, to pay an excise tax in any taxable year, may
exclude that part of their gross receipts upon which the excise tax is paid. In
such case, expenses incurred in the production of such gross receipts shall not
be deducted in computing net profits subject to the tax imposed by §
95.03.
      (6)   Amplification.  In amplification of the definition contained
herein, but not in limitation thereof, the following additional information
respecting net business profits is furnished.
         (a)   Net profits. Net profits shown on returns filed pursuant to this
subchapter must be reconciled, with the income reported to the Federal Internal
Revenue Service.
         (b)   Gross receipts.
            1.   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to income in
the form of commissions, fees, rentals from real and tangible personal
property, and other compensation for work or services performed or rendered as
well as income from sales of stock in trade.
            2.   From gross receipts there shall be deducted allowable expenses
to arrive at the net profits subject to tax.
         (c)   Expenses.
            1.   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business,
including reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed but no
deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or of the
partners, members or other owners of an unincorporated business, or enterprise.
               a.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or
elsewhere in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable
deduction for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from
theft or casualty not compensated for by insurance or otherwise of property
used in the trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized
for the purpose of the federal income tax. Provided however, that loss on the
sale, exchange or other disposition of depreciable property or real estate,
used in the taxpayer’s business shall not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the federal income tax.
               b.    Current amortization of emergency facilities under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if recognized as such for federal
income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction hereunder.
               c.   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed the
cost of demolition of the building, less any increase in the value of the land
caused by such demolition, will be allowed as an expense and may be completely
taken in the year of demolition or over a period of not to exceed five years.
               d.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Tax
Administrator (if the reserve method is used), as reasonable addition to the
reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount
allowable for federal income tax purposes.
               e.   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be
claimed as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not
subject to the tax, then taxes on and other expenses of said property are not
deductible. In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
(1) the tax under this subchapter; (2) federal or other taxes based upon
income; (3) gift, estate or inheritance taxes; and (4) taxes for local benefit
or improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
               f.   In general non-taxable income and expenses incurred in
connection therewith are not to be considered in determining net profits.
Income from intangibles, by way of dividends, interest and the like, shall not
be included if such income is subject to taxation under the intangible personal
property laws of the state or is specifically exempt from taxation under said
law.
               g.    Expenses attributable to non-taxable income shall not be
allowed. Where no record of such expenses is kept, 5% of the non- taxable
income will be considered as expenses applicable. However, where interest
income is equal to or greater than 25% of net income, and interest expenses are
claimed, the expenses attributable to non- taxable income shall be 50% of the
interest income or 5% of the total non-taxable income reported, whichever is
greater.
               h.   An employee who is paid on a commission or other
compensation basis and who pays his business expense from his commissions or
other compensation without reimbursement from his employers may deduct from his
gross commissions or other compensations, business expenses allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes but only incurred in
earning commissions or other compensations subject to the tax imposed by this
subchapter.
               i.    Income from the sale or lease of mineral rights are not
taxable and expenses or loss in connection therewith are not deductible for tax
purposes except in cases where the taxpayer conducts the activities by which
the minerals are extracted from the land.
               j.   Funds allocated by an employer to an employees’ qualified
profit sharing, pension or retirement fund are not taxable to the employee.
      (7)   Rental from real property.
         (a)   1.   The rental of real estate is ordinarily a business
activity, and the income from such rentals is taxable, provided however, where
the taxpayer’s entire rental activity produces gross rentals of less than $300
per month, it will be prima facie evidence that such rental activities are not
a business activity. (If gross rentals equal or exceed $300 per month, the
entire net income from rentals is taxable.)
            2.   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
         (b)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         (c)   Real property, as the term is used in this regulation, shall
include commercial property, residential property, farm property and any and
all other types of real estate.
         (d)   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.
         (e)   Residents of the municipality are subject to taxation upon the
net income from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the
location of the real property owned. However, if any such property is located
outside the municipality and is subject to another municipal income tax, credit
shall be claimed in accordance with §
95.15.
         (f)   Non-residents of the municipality are subject to such taxation
only if the real property is situated within the municipality.
         (g)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxed only on
that portion of income derived from property located in the municipality.
      (8)   Patents and copyrights.  Income from patents or copyrights is not
to be included in net profits subject to tax if the income from such patents or
copyrights is subject to state intangible tax. Conversely, such a state
intangible tax is not deductible in determining the municipal tax. Such items
shall be clearly disclosed on an attachment to be filed with the municipal tax
return.
      (9)   Royalties. Income in the form of royalties is taxable if the
taxpayer’s activities produced the publication or other product the sale of
which produces the royalties.
   (B)   Allocation of business profits. A request to change the method of
allocation must be made in writing before the end of the tax year.
      (1)   Separate accounting method.
         (a)   The net profits allocable to the municipality from business,
professional or other activities conducted in the municipality by corporations
or unincorporated entities (whether resident or non-resident) may be determined
from the records of the taxpayer if taxpayer has bona fide records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is
attributable to that part of his activities conducted within the municipality.
         (b)   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis
of apportioning net profits rather than the business allocation formula, a
statement must accompany the return explaining the manner in which such
apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the Tax Administrator to
determine whether the net profits attributable to the municipality are
apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
         (c)   In determining the income allocable to the municipality from the
books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution
made to the production of such income by headquarters activities of the
taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the municipality.
      (2)   Business allocation percentage method.
         (a)   STEP 1.    Ascertain the percentage which the average net book
value of real and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements,
owned or used in the business and situated within the municipality is of the
average net book value of all real and tangible personal property including
leasehold improvements, owned or used in the business wherever situated, during
the period covered by the return.
            1.   The percentage of the taxpayer’s real and tangible personal
property within the municipality is determined by dividing the average net book
value of such property within the municipality (without deduction of any
encumbrances) by the average net book value of all such property within and
without the municipality. In determining such percentage, property rented to
the taxpayer as well as real and tangible personal property owned by taxpayer
must be considered.
               a.   The net book value of real and tangible personal property
rented by the taxpayer shall be determined by multiplying gross annual rents by
eight.
               b.   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
                  i.    Any amount payable for the use or possession of real
and tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a
fixed sum of money or as a percentage of sales or profits or otherwise.
                  ii.    Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of
rent such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or other amounts required to
be paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
               c.   Non- resident professional persons shall use the factor of
number of offices everywhere to the number of offices located in the
municipality. A residence may not be considered an office unless a portion
thereof is used exclusively for business purposes and is reached by a separate
entrance in an exterior wall which does not serve as the entrance to the
balance of the building.
         (b)   STEP 2. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
taxpayer derived from sales made and services rendered in the municipality is
of the total gross receipts wherever derived during the period covered by the
return. All resident corporations, unincorporated businesses, or other entities
whose principal place of business is within the municipality, shall be
considered a resident municipal business and be subject to the following
provision: If the sales allocation percentage is less than 100%, a statement
must be submitted with the return indicating: other municipalities to which
sales are allocated; percentage of sales allocated to each municipality;
whether or not a return was filed and tax paid on the sales allocated to each
municipality. Failure to submit this statement (or when the statement indicates
no other municipal tax was filed and paid), will result in all sales being
considered as municipality sales.
            1.   The following sales shall be considered municipality sales:
               a.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
municipality to purchasers within or without the municipality except such of
said sales to purchasers outside the municipality that are directly
attributable to regular solicitations made outside the municipality personally
by the taxpayer’s employees.
               b.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the municipality if shipped or delivered from an office,
store, warehouse, factory or place of storage located within the municipality.
               c.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the municipality even though transported from a point outside
the municipality if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees
in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the municipality and the sale
is directly or indirectly the result of such solicitation.
               d.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the municipality
to purchasers outside the municipality if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place of delivery.
               e.    Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
            2.   In the application of the foregoing divisions a carrier shall
be considered the agent of the seller, regardless of the FOB point or other
conditions of the sale. The place at which orders are accepted or contracts
legally consummated shall be immaterial. Solicitation of customers outside the
municipality by mail or phone from an office or place of business within the
municipality shall not be considered a solicitation of sales outside the
municipality.
            3.   Non-resident professional persons shall use the factor of
municipality billings over total billings.
         (c)   STEP 3. Ascertain the percentage which the total wages,
salaries, commissions and other compensation of employees within the
municipality is of the total wages, salaries, commissions and other
compensation of all the taxpayer’s employees within and without the
municipality during the period covered by the return.
            1.   Salaries and reasonable compensation paid owners or credited
to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by the return
are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Qualifying wages, salaries and other compensation shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of
accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within
and without the municipality the amount treated as compensation for services
performed within the municipality shall be deemed to be:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to
his efforts within the municipality.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which
the value of his services within the municipality bears to the value of all his
services; and
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the municipality is of his total working time.
               d.    Provided however, an employee regularly connected with or
working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the
municipality who performs 75% or more of his services within the municipality
be considered an employee within the municipality.
            4.   a.   Non- resident professional persons shall use the factor
of days spent within the municipality to total working days.
               b.   All employees regularly connected with or working out of a
place of business maintained by the taxpayer outside the municipality who
perform 25% or less of their services within the municipality shall be
considered employees outside the municipality. (The provisions of this division
are not applicable in determining the tax liability of a non-resident who works
in and outside the municipality.)
         (d)   STEP 4. Add the percentages determined in accordance with Steps
1, 2 and 3 or such of the aforesaid percentages as may be applicable to the
particular taxpayer’s business and divide the total so obtained by the number
of percentages used in ascertaining said total. The result so obtained is the
business allocation percentage. In determining the average percentage, a factor
shall not be excluded from the computation merely because said factor is found
to be allocable entirely in or outside the municipality. A factor is excluded
only when it does not exist anywhere.
         (e)   STEP 5. The business allocation percentage determined in Step 4
above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits allocable to the municipality.
      (3)   Substitute method.
         (a)   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained
under the formula, the Tax Administrator, upon application of the taxpayer, may
substitute other factors in the formula or prescribe other methods of
allocating net income calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation.
         (b)   Application to the Tax Administrator to substitute other factors
in the formula or to use a different method to allocate net profits must be
made in writing and shall state the specific grounds on which the substitution
of factors or use of a different method is requested and the relief sought to
be obtained. A copy thereof shall be served at the time of filing upon the
taxpayer or the Tax Administrator as the case may be. No specific form need be
followed in making such application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a
substitute method he must continue to so file until given permission to change
by the Tax Administrator.
         (c)   The decision of the Tax Administrator on divisions (3)(a) and
(b) above may be appealed by the taxpayer to the Board of Appeals, which shall
have the power to adjust, modify or overrule said decision of the Tax
Administrator.
      (4)   Prima facie. In the case of professional people and others
furnishing personal services, if their only place of business is within the
municipality all their net profits shall prima facie be attributable to the
municipality.
      (5)   Net operating loss.  The portion of a net operating loss, based on
income taxable under this subchapter, sustained in the taxable year beginning
after December 31, 2002, allocable to the city may be applied against the
portion of succeeding years allocable to the city, until exhausted, but in no
event for more than three years immediately following the year in which the
loss was sustained. No portion of a net operating loss shall be carried back
against the net profits of any prior year.
   (C)   Consolidated returns.
       (1)   Consolidated returns may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership. For a corporation to be included in a
consolidated return 80% of its stock must be owned by the other members of the
affiliated group. A consolidated return must include all companies which are so
affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year the
consolidated group must continue to file consolidated return in subsequent
years unless:
         (a)   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Administrator to
file separate returns.
         (b)   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.
         (c)   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group into
another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.
   (D)   Exceptions. The following shall not be considered taxable:
      (1)   Poor relief, unemployment insurance benefits, old age pensions or
similar payments received from local, state or federal government or charitable
or religious organizations.
      (2)   Proceeds of insurance, annuities, workers’ compensation insurance,
social security benefits, pensions, compensation for damages for personal
injuries and like reimbursement, not including damages for loss of profits.
      (3)   Compensation for damage to property by way of insurance or
otherwise.
      (4)   Interest and dividends from intangible property, and distributions
from a decedent’s estate or a trust.
      (5)   Military pay and allowances received as a member of the Armed
Forces of the United States.
      (6)   Any charitable, educational, fraternal or other type of non profit
association or organization enumerated in Ohio R.C. § 718.01 to the extent that
such income is derived from tax exempt real estate, tax exempt tangible or
intangible property or tax exempt activities.
      (7)   Compensation earned by itinerants.
      (8)   Income from a fellowship is exempt only when given for attendance
as a student at a recognized college or university and exempt for federal
income tax purposes.
      (9)   Alimony is not taxed to the recipient nor is it allowed as a
deduction by the payor.
      (10)   Capital gains and losses (including gains or losses from the sale,
exchange, or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer’s trader business) shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at net profits earned.
   (E)   Any taxpayer not exempt by subdivisions (D)(1) through (D)(9) is
required to file a declaration and final return and remit the taxes levied
under this subchapter.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05; Am. Ord. 65-07, passed 10-9-07)
§ 95.19 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Date and requirement for filing.
      (1)   The return shall be accompanied by payment of any taxes due
thereon.
      (2)   Every person shall, except as hereinafter provided, file a return
setting forth the aggregate amount of salaries, wages, commissions and other
personal service compensation, net profits from business or other activities,
including the rental from use of real and personal property, distributive
shares from partnerships, other income taxable under this subchapter, received
for the period covered by the return and such other pertinent facts and
information in detail as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   An informational return shall be required even if a resident’s
entire earnings from the tax period are paid by the employer or employers
through the withholding procedure. Such informational return shall require the
resident to document that no additional income has been received that is
subject to this income tax.
      (4)   An employee who is permitted to deduct business expenses from gross
wages, salaries and commissions must file a return in order to claim such
deductions even though all or part of such wages, salaries or commissions are
subject to withholding.
      (5)   Except as provided for herein, the tax is on the partnership, or
association as an entity whether resident or non-resident and a return is
required disclosing the net profits allocable to the municipality and the tax
paid thereon. However, any resident partner of a nonresident entity is required
to make a return and pay the tax in accordance with these regulations if a
municipal tax is due.
      (6)   Executors and administrators are liable for the payment of any
taxes due by a deceased from an estate of the deceased.
      (7)   With respect to a return combining taxable income from two or more
sources, the following rules shall be applied:
         (a)   Losses from the operation of a business or profession are not
deductible from employee earnings.
         (b)   A loss from the operation of a business or profession may be
offset against net profits from other business or professional activities in
the amount of the loss commensurate with the portion of profits, if profits
existed, with respect to which credit could not be claimed for tax paid to
another municipality. Accordingly, if the profits of an activity are subject to
tax by another municipality, the portion of a loss that may not be used to
offset profits is determined by multiplying the loss by a fraction, the
numerator being either the tax rate of the other taxing municipality or the
percentage rate to which credit for tax paid to another municipality is
limited, whichever is the lesser, and the denominator being the existing
municipality tax rate.
   (B)   Information required and reconciliation with federal returns.
      (1)   In returns filed hereunder, there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and
other compensation subject to the tax earned from each employer, taxable net
profits and other pertinent information as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (2)   Where figures to total income, deductions and net profits are
included, as shown by a federal return, any items of income which are not
subject to the tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in determining
net income subject to the tax. The fact that any taxpayer is not required to
file a federal return does not relieve him from filing a tax return under this
subchapter.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the municipality, but who are subject to tax on net profits
attributable to the municipality, under the method of allocation provided for,
are considered to be employers within the municipality and subject to the
requirements of withholding. A nonresident employer, agent of such an employer,
or other payor that is not situated in the City shall be required to deduct and
withhold taxes from the taxable income of an individual.
      (4)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes owed and paid to the municipality, a claim for refund shall be filed
with the Tax Administrator as prescribed in §
95.11.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05; Am. Ord. 65-07, passed 10-9-07)
§ 95.20 COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (A)   Duty of withholding.
      (1)   The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
         (a)   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, fees, commissions or other forms of compensation paid to residents of
the municipality, regardless of the place where the services are rendered; and
         (b)   All compensation paid non-residents for services rendered, work
performed or other activities engaged in within the municipality.
         (c)   An employer is liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the municipality are
required to make the collections and deductions specified, regardless of the
fact that the services on account of which any particular deduction is required
as to residents of the municipality were performed outside the municipality.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the municipality, but who are subject to tax on net profits
attributable to the municipality, under the method of allocation provided for,
are considered to be employers within the municipality and subject to the
requirements of withholding.
      (4)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation paid. If the employer has withheld the tax and failed to pay the
tax withheld to the Tax Administrator, the employee is not liable for the tax
so withheld.
      (5)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payor, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax.
      (6)   Where a non-resident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the municipality, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the municipality in accordance with
the following rules of apportionment:
         (a)   If the non-resident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the portion of
the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by the employee within the municipality bears to the total volume of
business transacted by him or her within and outside the municipality.
         (b)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation
of other non-resident employees, including officers of corporations, shall
attach to the proportion of the personal service compensation of such employee
which the total number of his working hours within the municipality is of the
total number of working hours.
         (c)   The fact that non- resident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the allocation of pay for time worked within the
municipality on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in
the municipality will be computed on the basis of a 40-hour week unless the
employer notifies the Tax Administrator that a greater or less number of hours
per week is worked. The determination of tax liability of non-residents working
in and out of the corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the
total number of days worked in the municipality divided by the total number of
days worked during the year and the resulting percentage applied to the total
annual income from wages including sick leave and vacation pay. Where no record
can be substantiated of the number of days worked, the figure 254 is to be used
as the total number of days worked.
         (d)   Wages of itinerants are not subject to withholding.
      (7)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (8)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses necessarily and
actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of his services,
provided such expenses are incurred in earning compensation, including
commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the employee.
      (9)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a non-resident
of the municipality, and has no knowledge to the contrary, shall be relieved of
the responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid
to such employee for services rendered or work done outside the municipality by
such employee, provided however, that such employer must withhold the tax on
all personal service compensation paid such employee after the Tax
Administrator notifies the employer in writing that such employee is a resident
of the municipality. All employees are required to notify the employer of any
change of residence and the date thereof.
      (10)   An employer shall not be required to withhold the tax from the
wages and other compensation earned by a resident of the municipality for work
done or services performed in another municipality which imposes a tax upon
such wages and other compensation of such resident if such employer withholds
the tax on such resident’s wages or other compensation for such other
municipality. Where such municipal tax is for a smaller amount than the tax
imposed by this subchapter the employer shall furnish the Tax Administrator
with a list of resident employees for whom such lesser tax is withheld.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall have the authority to enter into
agreement with other taxing municipalities permitting an employer to withhold
the entire tax on the wages of a floater either for the taxing municipality in
which the employer has his principal place of business or the taxing
municipality in which the employee resides.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax withheld and status of employers.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require an employer to file returns of
and to remit taxes withheld more frequently than quarterly in cases where the
employer will be present within the corporate limits of the municipality for a
period of less than a year.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted is withheld
from the employee’s pay, the excess shall be refunded by the employer to the
employee. If less than the amount of tax required to be deducted is deducted
and withheld by the employer in any pay period or pay periods, the deficiency
shall be deducted in subsequent pay periods.
   (C)   Fractional parts of cent. In deducting and withholding the tax at the
source and in payment of any tax due, a fractional part of a cent shall be
disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more in which case it shall
be increased to one cent.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05)
§ 95.21 DECLARATION.
   (A)   Requirement of filing. A taxpayer’s final return for the preceding
year may be used as the basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax
for the current year. In the event a taxpayer has not previously been required
to file a final return, a declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income
shall be filed in good faith.
   (B)   Amended declaration.
      (1)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before the last day of
the month following the close of the taxpayer’s tax year if it appears that the
original declaration made for such fiscal year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by 30% or more. At such time a payment which together with prior
payments is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated liability shall
be made. If upon the filing of the return required it appears that the taxpayer
did not pay 70% of his tax liability, as shown on the return, on or before the
last day of the month following the close of a tax year, the difference between
70% of the taxpayer’s tax liability and the amount of estimated tax he actually
paid on or before the date shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of §
95.10.
      (2)   In the event an amended declaration has been filed the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05)
§ 95.22 DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   Enforcement provisions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer or employer desiring a special ruling on any matter
pertaining to this subchapter or these rules and regulations, should submit to
the Tax Administrator in writing all the facts pertinent to the matter on which
the ruling is sought.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Administrator that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until the proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him or her.
      (3)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total
unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable immediately
and the provisions of §§
95.11 and
95.12 shall apply.
   (B)   Estimation of tax by Tax Administrator.
      (1)   Whenever the Tax Administrator has been unable to secure
information from the taxpayer as to his taxable income for any year, he may
determine the amount of tax appearing to be due and assess the taxpayer upon
the basis of such determination, together with interest and penalties as
prescribed in §
95.10.
      (2)   Such determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by the
taxpayer of actual records from which his tax may be computed, provided the
submission of such actual records occurs within 30 days of the Tax
Administrator’s assessment notice.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05)
§ 95.23 EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS.
   Investigations by Tax Administrator. An employer or supposed employer and
every taxpayer shall furnish, within ten days following a written request by
the Tax Administrator, or his duly authorized agent, the means, facilities and
opportunity for making examinations and investigations.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05)
§ 95.24 CREDIT ALLOWED FOR THE TAX PAID IN ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   No credit will be given unless the taxpayer claims such on his final
return or other form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, and presents such
evidence of the payment of a similar tax to another municipality, as the Tax
Administrator may require.
   (B)   A refund must be claimed by the taxpayer or his employer within three
years of the date of filing the final return for the year for which such refund
is claimed. The Tax Administrator may require verification.
(Ord. 1-05, passed 1-24-05)
§ 95.25 SAVING CLAUSE.
   These rules and regulations contain changes from the rules and regulations
adopted for previous years in an effort to affect uniform administration of
municipal income taxes throughout the state, and changes in these regulations
from those of previous years do not imply any intent to effect a substantial
change in the rules and regulations, but are merely changes in form.

§ 95.26 AMENDMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS.
   From time to time, amendments and supplements to this subchapter may be
recommended by the Board of Appeals or the Tax Administrator for consideration
by City Council.

   (A)   Whenever any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful
or an offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or
the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty
is otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision of this subchapter
shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500, a term of imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
   (B)   The failure of any officer or employee of the municipality to perform
any official duty imposed by this code shall not subject the officer or
employee to the penalty imposed for a violation unless a penalty is
specifically provided for such failure.

§ 95.61 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSE OF TAX.
   (A)   To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations and
capital improvements, the City of Cambridge hereby levies an annual municipal
income tax on income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and
on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   The annual tax is levied at a rate of 2.0%. The tax is levied at a
uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving income in the
City of Cambridge. The tax is levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions
and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in §
95.63 and other sections as they may apply.
   (C)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this
subchapter are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution.

of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer

   As used in the preceding division, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such

         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

95.72(A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by §
95.72(A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or

compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer

         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (F)(3)(a) or (b) of this section

liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer

business in the City of Cambridge shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the City of

payment and subsequent payments, based on the Tax Administrator's
determination, may be required tube made by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City of
Cambridge. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agents, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section.

file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or

tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City of Cambridge the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City of Cambridge income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of
Cambridge income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for

greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)1. of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends

section, an employer is not required to withhold the City of Cambridge income
tax on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services in the City of Cambridge if the employee performed such services in
the City of Cambridge on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City

applies at the time the services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in §
95.64.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City of Cambridge only if the employee spent more time performing services for
or on behalf of the employer in the City of Cambridge than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a) Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City of Cambridge exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the City of Cambridge for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of Cambridge.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City of
Cambridge under division (C)(4)(a)of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the City of Cambridge for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Cambridge.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City of Cambridge and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in §
95.62, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City of Cambridge, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Cambridge.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions(C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under §
95.64 of this subchapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the City of
Cambridge.
      (2)   Retirees having no municipal taxable income for the City of
Cambridge income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written
exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax
Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's federal

corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Cambridge's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Cambridge's income tax
return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Cambridge's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the City of Cambridge income
tax return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before
the date the City of Cambridge income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator
shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Cambridge's
income tax return. The extended due date of the City of Cambridge's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.

the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Cambridge, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City of Cambridge
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is $10 or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City of Cambridge for
a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
City of Cambridge an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City of Cambridge income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply;
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the City of
Cambridge for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in §
95.62(C)(1)(g) within the City of Cambridge.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the City of
Cambridge and does not expect to be subject to the City of Cambridge income tax
for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City of Cambridge. The affidavit shall
also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the City of Cambridge, make any sales in the City of Cambridge,
or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Cambridge during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
City of Cambridge for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Cambridge Income
Tax Ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City of Cambridge by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in § 95.64 shall be allowed to the
taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the
City of Cambridge, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the City of
Cambridge and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City of Cambridge to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Cambridge,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Cambridge or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this subchapter and of the City of Cambridge's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of
Cambridge for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the City of Cambridge during
the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the 180th day after the
member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City of Cambridge before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City of Cambridge in
accordance with this subchapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing

filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before consideration of net
operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME

   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Cambridge's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1) or (2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-
year period.
      (5)   When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the
remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the City of Cambridge income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Cambridge. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated the City of Cambridge income tax return for a taxable
year shall file a consolidated the City of Cambridge income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.

tax return in the same manner as is required under the United States department
of treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated the City of Cambridge income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
95.62(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated the City of Cambridge income tax return shall
do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit

purpose of making the computations required in §
95.65(R) through (Y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Cambridge. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
95.65(R) through (Y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Cambridge. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
95.65(R) through (Y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City of Cambridge;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of
Cambridge income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated the City of Cambridge income tax
return shall make the computations required under §
95.65(R) through (Y) by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated the City of Cambridge income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Cambridge in accordance
with this subchapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City of Cambridge before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the City of Cambridge may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this subchapter,
may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to
the other municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit

that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the City of Cambridge from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the City of Cambridge in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §
95.65(G) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the taxpayer
becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City of
Cambridge, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the 15th day of the twelfth month of the taxable
year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year. For taxable years
beginning on or after January 1, 2018 for an individual, on or before the 15th
day of the first month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability
for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.

that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with §
95.65.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to §
95.78 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the City of Cambridge
under §
95.65 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Cambridge
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

§ 95.68 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this subchapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

dollar that is less than $0.50 shall be dropped. If a person chooses to round
amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts entered on
the document.

§ 95.69 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in §
95.78.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City of Cambridge:
      (1)   Overpayments of $10 or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is $10 or more.
   (C)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
95.81.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
95.78(A)(4).

§ 95.70 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Cambridge, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Cambridge as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Cambridge is subject to recovery by the
City of Cambridge. If the City of Cambridge's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the City of Cambridge shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the City of Cambridge claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the City of Cambridge's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Cambridge's tax rate. However, if the City of Cambridge's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Cambridge, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.

§ 95.71 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City of Cambridge changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Cambridge. The amended return shall be filed on a form
required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (a)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         (b)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under §
95.72 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Cambridge. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in §
95.69.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the City of Cambridge's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the City of Cambridge return
showing income subject to the City of Cambridge income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional the City of Cambridge income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
$10.

whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, QUALIFYING DEFERRAL PERIOD means a period
of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Appeals the request described in §
95.81. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Appeals did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Appeals becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Appeals, the 60th day after the
date on which the final determination of the Board of Appeals is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is

   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after

reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
95.69.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Cambridge does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Appeals, of the Ohio board of
tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by §
95.69, with interest on that amount as provided by §
95.69(E).
   (E)   No civil action to recover the City of Cambridge income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

§ 95.73 AUDITS.
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   (1)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer
is entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a
form by which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
      (2)   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the
taxpayer's attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

§ 95.74 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   LAST KNOWN ADDRESS means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS means an address to which the postal service
or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056 is not able to deliver
an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for non-delivery
is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under R.C. § 5703.056. With
the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax Administrator
may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this
section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under R.C. § 5703.056. If
the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)   Once the Tax Administrator or other the City of Cambridge
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Appeals within 60 days after
the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

frequent intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed. The Tax Administrator, within the
office of the Treasurer, shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date

payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under
this chapter shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the City

§ 119.08 LIABILITY; ASSESSMENT AND PETITION FOR REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (A)   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the city as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Tax Administrator
may make an assessment against such vendor based upon any information in the
Tax Administrator's possession.
   (B)   If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails to
pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject
to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Tax Administrator may make
an assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
   (C)   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable
to such transaction.
   (D)   In each case the Tax Administrator shall give to the vendor or
transient guest assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be
served upon the vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered
or certified mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter shall not be considered an election of remedies, nor
a bar to an assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same
transaction, provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or
transient guest for the tax due on a transaction if said tax has been paid by
another.
   (E)   The Tax Administrator may make an assessment against any vendor who
fails to file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper
amount of tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the
possession of the Tax Administrator indicates that the amount required to be
collected is or should be greater that the amount remitted by the vendor, the
Tax Administrator may, upon the basis of test checks of a vendor's business for
a representative period which are hereby authorized, determine the ratio which
the tax required to be collected under this chapter bears to the hotel's or
transient accommodation's lodgings, which determination shall be the basis of
an assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such assessment
shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
   (F)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom said notice of
assessment is directed, files within 30 days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered mail a petition in writing, verified under oath by
said vendor, transient guest, or his authorized agent, having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with particularly the items of said assessment objected
to, together with the reasons for such objections, said assessment shall become
conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and payable, from the vendor or
transient guest so assessed, to the Tax Administrator. When a petition for
reassessment is filed, the Tax Administrator shall assign a time and place for
the hearing of the same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by registered
or certified mail, but the Tax Administrator may continue the hearings from
time to time if necessary.
   (G)   When any vendor of transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Tax Administrator,
together with penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days
after notice of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either
personally or by registered or by certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 19-12, passed 5-14-12) Penalty, see §
119.99

the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
three years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. This
section does not bar an assessment:
   (A)   When the Tax Administrator has substantial evidence of amounts of
taxes collected by a vendor from transient guest's lodging which were not
returned to the city:

119.99
§ 119.11 VENDOR TO COLLECT TAX; PROHIBITION AGAINST REBATES.
   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by this
chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest, either
directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter, or make
in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which might
imply that he is absorbing the tax, or paying the tax for the transient guest
by an adjustment of price, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax,
or rebating the tax in any manner unless otherwise permitted by R.C. § 5739.03.
(Ord. 19-12, passed 5-14-12) Penalty, see §

of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter, or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false, or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet in the filing of any
false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
(Ord. 19-12, passed 5-14-12) Penalty, see §
119.99
§ 119.13 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.

the city under the provisions of this chapter, fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 19-12, passed 5-14-12) Penalty, see §

capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
      CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, reckless-ness, or negligence, as defined
in R.C. § 2901.22.
      INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from
the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or
received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (`63 Code, § 501.07)
§ 130.07 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (`63 Code, § 501.08)
§ 130.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (`63 Code, § 501.11)
§ 130.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (`63 Code, § 501.12)
§ 130.10 ATTEMPT.
   (A)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (C)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (D)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (E)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (F)   As used in this section:
      DRUG ABUSE OFFENSE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2925.01.
      MOTOR VEHICLE has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4501.01.

Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
   Solid and hazardous wastes, see R.C. Ch. 3734
§ 130.11 COMPLICITY.
   (A)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of R.C. §
2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (B)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (C)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of R.C. § 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (D)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with R.C.
§ 2923.03(D).
   (E)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (F)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(R.C. § 2923.03) (`63 Code, § 501.10)
Statutory reference:
   Conspiracy, see R.C. § 2923.01
§ 130.12 CRIMINAL LAW JURISDICTION.
   (A)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this municipality,
any element of which takes place in this municipality;
      (2)   While in this municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this municipality and the
other jurisdiction, or, while in this municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
      (3)   While out of this municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this municipality;
      (5)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this municipality;
      (6)   While out of this municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another person and subsequently brings the other person into this
municipality;
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer

service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
municipality in violation of the law of this state or municipality.
   (B)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this municipality.
   (C)   (1)   This municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
municipality for purposes of this section.
      (2)   The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest
shore of the Ohio River extending to the opposite shore line, between the
extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (D)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
municipality for purposes of this section.
   (E)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this municipality.
   (F)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (G)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this municipality.
   (H)   For purposes of division (A)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.

intake process at an institution operated by or under the control of the
department. If the court commits the child to or places the child in a
detention facility, district detention facility, school, camp, institution, or
other facility for delinquent children, the chief administrative officer of the
detention facility, district detention facility, school, camp, institution, or
facility to which the child is committed or in which the child was placed shall
cause the DNA specimen to be collected from the child during the intake process
for the detention facility, district detention facility, school, camp,
institution, or facility. The DNA specimen shall be collected from the child in

facility, school, camp, institution, or facility to which the child is
committed or in which the child was placed. The DNA specimen shall be collected
in accordance with division (C) of this section.
      (3)   If a child is adjudicated a delinquent child for committing an act
listed in division (D) of this section, is not committed to or placed in the
department of youth services, a detention facility or district detention
facility, or a school, camp, institution, or other facility for delinquent
children described in R.C. § 2152.19(A)(2) or (3), and does not provide a DNA
specimen pursuant to division (B)(1) or (2) of this section, the juvenile court
shall order the child to report to the county probation department immediately
after disposition to submit to a DNA specimen collection procedure administered
by the chief administrative officer of the county probation department. The DNA
specimen shall be collected from the child in accordance with division (C) of
this section.

or a similarly invasive procedure, a physician, registered nurse, licensed
practical nurse, duly licensed clinical laboratory technician, or other
qualified medical practitioner shall collect in a medically approved manner the
DNA specimen required to be collected pursuant to division (B) of this section.
If the DNA specimen is collected by swabbing for buccal cells or a similarly
noninvasive procedure, this section does not require that the DNA specimen be
collected by a qualified medical practitioner of that nature. No later than 15
days after the date of the collection of the DNA specimen, the Director of
Youth Services or the chief administrative officer of the detention facility,
district detention facility, school, camp, institution, or other facility for

of the following acts:
      (1)   An act that would be a felony if committed by an adult;

September 3, 1996, that previously was dismissed or amended.
      (3)   A violation of R.C. § 2919.23 or any substantially equivalent

person is incarcerated at the time of sentencing, the person shall submit to a
DNA specimen collection procedure administered by the Director of
Rehabilitation and Correction or the chief administrative officer of the jail
or other detention facility in which the person is incarcerated. The DNA
specimen shall be collected in accordance with division (C) of this section.
   (C)   If the DNA specimen is collected by withdrawing blood from the person
or a similarly invasive procedure, a physician, registered nurse, licensed
practical nurse, duly licensed clinical laboratory technician, or other
qualified medical practitioner shall collect in a medically approved manner the
DNA specimen required to be collected pursuant to division (B) of this section.
If the DNA specimen is collected by swabbing for buccal cells or a similarly
noninvasive procedure, this section does not require that the DNA specimen be
collected by a qualified medical practitioner of that nature. No later than 15

Bureau shall provide the specimen vials, mailing tubes, labels, postage, and
instructions needed for the collection and forwarding of the DNA specimen to
the Bureau.
   (D)   The Director of Rehabilitation and Correction, the chief
administrative officer of the jail, community-based correctional facility, or
other county, multicounty, municipal, municipal-county, or multicounty-
municipal detention facility, or the chief administrative officer of a county
probation department or the adult parole authority shall cause a DNA specimen
to be collected in accordance with divisions (B) and (C) of this section from a
person in its custody or under its supervision who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to any of the following misdemeanor offenses:
      (1)   A misdemeanor violation, an attempt to commit a misdemeanor
violation, or complicity in committing a misdemeanor violation of R.C. §
2907.04.
      (2)   A misdemeanor violation of any law that arose out of the same facts
and circumstances and same act as did a charge against the person of a
violation of R.C. § 2903.01, 2903.02, 2905.01, 2907.02, 2907.03, 2907.04,
2907.05 or 2911.11 that previously was dismissed or amended, or as did a charge
against the person of a violation of R.C. § 2907.12 as it existed prior to
September 3, 1996, that previously was dismissed or amended.
      (3)   A misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2919.23 that would have been a
violation of R.C. § 2905.04 as it existed prior to July 1, 1996, had it been
committed prior to that date.
      (4)   A sexually oriented offense or a child- victim oriented offense,
both as defined in R.C. § 2950.01, that is a misdemeanor, if, in relation to
that offense, the offender has been adjudicated a sexual predator, child-victim
predator, habitual sex offender, or habitual child-victim offender, all as
defined in R.C. § 2950.01.
   (E)   The Director of Rehabilitation and Correction may prescribe rules in

offender supervision described in R.C. § 5149.21.
(R.C. § 2901.07)
§ 130.15 SELF-DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (A)   As used in this section, RESIDENCE has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (B)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (C)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person's residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
§ 130.99 PENALTY FOR TITLE XIII.
   (A)   Except where otherwise specifically classified within the body of the
section of a chapter of this title, a violation of such section shall be deemed
a misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than $500,
imprisonment of not more than six months, or both.
(R.C. § 715.67)
   (B)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (B)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (B)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (B)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (B)(1) through (B)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. § 2929.21) (`63 Code, § 501.99(A))
   (C)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in § 133.99 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or
2929.23 or division (C)(5) of this section and unless another term is required
or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon
an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on
the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail
term that shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (C) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (E)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (C)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (C) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(C)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (C)(5)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (C)(5)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (C)(5)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (E) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (D) of
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(C), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (E) or (F) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (D)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in §
133.99 of this Code or R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (C) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (E), (F), or (G) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (C) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (D)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (E), (F), or (G) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   Except as provided in division (D)(4)(c) of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (D)(1)(b) of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision
under R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (D)(4)(b) of
this section based on the violation.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (D)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (D)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (E), (F), or (G) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (G) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (E)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (E). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (E)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (E) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (E)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (G) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (E)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (E)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (F)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (F)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (F)(2) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (G)   Financial sanctions. 
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (G) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (G) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (G), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (G) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.

by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if

provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (G) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.

for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).

            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (G)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.

costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction

      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (G)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (E), (F),
or (G) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (E) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under

      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (G)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (G)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (G)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (G)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (G)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (G)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (G)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.

            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (G)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (G) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:

installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (G) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
      (10)   If an offender is sentenced to pay restitution, a fine, fee, or
incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make
the offender's payment history available to the victim, victim's
representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, the prosecutor, the probation
department, and the court without cost.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (H)   Organizational penalties.

than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to § 130.08,
either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this section.

§ 131.19 VALUE OF STOLEN PROPERTY.
   (A)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of R.C. § 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (B)   (1)   When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A), R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or
2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. § 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a
series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts
to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations
of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service
member or spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the
offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to
another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of
the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of
determining the value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value
of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 1716.14(A),
R.C. § 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, R.C. § 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or R.C. §
2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more than one
victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant
to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a
single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed
against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active
duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the
property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value as
required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under R.C. § 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by R.C. § 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property
and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or more
offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2) or
(B)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of R.C. § 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (B)
(1) or (B)(3) of this section or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (B)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (C)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (C)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (C)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, FAIR
MARKET VALUE is the money  consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (D)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

meaning.
   RENTER. A person who owns rented property.

violation of this section defenses, affirmative defenses, and limitations on
remedies that would be available in a civil, criminal or administrative action
or proceeding under the Lanham Act, being 15 USC 1051 - 1127, as amended, the

the court involved shall declare that the goods described in division (D)(1)(a)
of this section and the personal property described in division (D)(1)(b) of
this section are contraband and are forfeited. Prior to the court's entry of
judgment under Criminal Rule 32, the owner of a registered trademark or service
mark that is the subject to the counterfeit mark may recommend a manner in
which the forfeited goods and forfeited personal property should be disposed
of. If that owner makes a timely recommendation of a manner of disposition, the
court is not bound by the recommendation. If that owner makes a timely
recommendation of a manner of disposition, the court may include in its entry
of judgment an order that requires appropriate persons to dispose of the
forfeited goods and forfeited personal property in the recommended manner. If
the owner fails to make a timely recommendation of a manner of disposition or
if that owner makes a timely recommendation of a manner of disposition but the
court determines to not follow the recommendation, the court shall include in
its entry of judgement an order that requires the law enforcement agency that
employs the law enforcement officer who seized the forfeited goods or the
forfeited personal property to destroy them or cause their destruction.
   (E)   This section does not affect the rights of an owner of a trademark or
service mark, or the enforcement in a civil action or in administrative
proceedings of the rights of an owner or a trademark or service mark under the
Lanham Act, being 15 USC 1051 - 1127, as amended, the Trademark Counterfeiting
Act of 1984, being 18 USC 2320, as amended, R.C. Chapter 1329, or another
section of the Ohio Revised Code, or common law.
   (F)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning:

         (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this definition,
COUNTERFEIT MARK means a spurious trademark or a spurious service mark that
satisfies both of the following:
            1.   It is identical with or substantially indistinguishable from a
mark that is registered on the principal register in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office for the same goods or services as the goods or services to
which or in connection with which the spurious trademark or spurious service
mark is attached, affixed, or otherwise used, or from a mark that is registered
with the Secretary of State pursuant to R.C. §§ 1329.54 through 1329.67 for the
same goods or services as the goods or services to which or in connection with
which the spurious trademark or spurious service mark is attached, affixed, or
otherwise used, and the owner of the registration uses that registered
trademark, whether or not the offender knows that the mark is registered in a
manner described in this division (a)1.
            2.   Its use is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive
other persons.
         (b)   COUNTERFEIT MARK does not include a mark or other designation
that is attached to, affixed to, or otherwise used in connection with goods or
services if the holder of the right to use the mark or other designation
authorizes the manufacturer, producer, or vendor of those goods or services to
attach, affix, or otherwise use the mark or other designation in connection
with those goods or services at the time of their manufacture, production or
sale.

by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a police officer
shall, prior to any arrest for an offense this section, afford the person an

§ 150.72 DISPOSITION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   No insurance company doing business in the state shall pay a claim of the
named insured for the fire damage to a structure located within the city where
the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance
policies exceeds $20,000 and is greater than or equal to 60% of all fire
insurance policy monetary limitations unless there is compliance with the
following procedures:
   (A)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured and the insurance
company equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire
policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company, in
accordance with R.C. § 715.26(F), shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to
the Auditor of the City in the aggregate amount of $1,000 for each $20,000 and
each fraction of that amount, of a claim or, if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured and the insurance company, the named
insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing or securing the building or other structure, shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
   (B)   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the city may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
   (C)   The named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the
costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure after
the transfer, and the Auditor of the city, after notifying the City Code
Enforcement Supervisor, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured, provided that the city has not commenced to
remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
   (D)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the city as authorized by this section,
the Auditor of the city shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing

§ 151.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statutory authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Cambridge, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (B)   Findings of fact. The city has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (C)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood-prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (D)   Methods of reducing flood loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (E)   Lands to which these regulations apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as
identified in §
151.01(F), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the city.
   (F)   Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Guernsey County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map, Guernsey County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
both effective August 16, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the city as required by §
151.04(C) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Engineer's Office, 1131 Steubenville Ave.
Cambridge, Ohio 43725.
   (G)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed, restriction, covenant or easement, but
the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (H)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (I)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (J)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 27-11, passed 5-23-11)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to the principal structure.
   APPEAL. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's

flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from one
to three feet).
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   ENCLOSURE BELOW THE LOWEST FLOOR. See “Lowest floor” as defined in this
section.
   EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT). Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
   FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA). The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   FILL. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   FLOOD or FLOODING. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community, depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RISK ZONES. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      ZONE A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
      ZONES A1-30 AND ZONE AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
      ZONE AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      ZONE A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      ZONE B AND ZONE X (SHADED): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      ZONE C AND ZONE X (UNSHADED): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   FLOOD PROTECTION ELEVATION (FPE). The base flood elevation. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the FLOOD
PROTECTION ELEVATION can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A
FLOODWAY is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering
analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of
the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall
the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING ANALYSIS. An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC). An official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   LETTER OF MAP REVISION (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure below the
lowest floor, which is an unfinished or flood- resistant enclosure usable
solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other
than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with
the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
MANUFACTURED HOME does not include a recreational vehicle. For the purposes of
these regulations, a MANUFACTURED HOME includes manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in R.C. Chapter 3733.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK. As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, any tract of land
upon which three or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked,
either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway,
building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of
the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM (NFIP). The NFIP is a federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structures for which the start of construction commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of Cambridge Flood Insurance
Rate Map, March 18, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   PERSON. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An AGENCY is further defined in R.C. § 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution,
state college or university, community college district, technical college
district, or state community college. AGENCY does not include the general
assembly, the controlling board, the Adjutant General's department, or any
court.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECT. A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of R.C. §§ 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER. A person registered as a professional
engineer under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL SURVEYOR. A person registered as a professional
surveyor, under R.C. Chapter 4733.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood Hazard”, it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer
to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other federal, state, or
local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting  high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. “Permanent
construction” does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Flood-related damage of any origin sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each such flood event equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. When the combined total of all previous improvements  or repairs
made during the life of the structure equals or exceeds 50% of a structure’s
market value, that structure is considered a substantial improvement. This term
includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 27-11, passed 5-23-11)

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the city’s flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
151.01(F) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
151.04(C).
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical

151.03(J)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         (d)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to §
151.03(J)(1)(a).
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor, and may be
submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the city
have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an
area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In order that the city's Flood Insurance
Rate Map accurately represent the city boundaries, include within such
notification a copy of a map of the city suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the city has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (K)   Data use and flood map interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         (a)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
         (b)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in §
151.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (L)   Substantial damage determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with increased cost of
compliance insurance claims.

actions.
      (2)   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         (a)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
         (b)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
151.04(I)(1((b)1. and 2. through 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the bankfull stage.
The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods presented
in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a federal, state, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
         (a)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         (b)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         (c)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
city specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         (d)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in §
151.03(J)(1)(a)3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         (d)   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         (e)   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         (a)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         (b)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in §
151.05(D)(2)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         (c)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (E)   Procedure at hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (F)   Appeal to the court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in R.C. Chapter 2506.

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

§ 152.08 DECLARATION OF URGENCY.
   This chapter shall protect and preserve the public health, safety, and
general welfare of the residents and neighborhoods of this city for the
following reasons:
   (A)   The unregulated installation of manufactured homes on single-family
residentially zoned lots throughout the city may adversely impact property
values in certain neighborhoods where manufactured homes (either in general or
because of the specific types installed) are incompatible and unsuitable, and
proper development and design standards and criteria are not applied. This
would result in the economic and social deterioration of current neighborhoods
and the city, as well as in potentially substantial losses to current residents
and property owners, both in terms of their investments in property and their
confidence in the ability of the city to protect them and manage its affairs.
   (B)   The unregulated installation of manufactured homes throughout the city
may adversely impact areas of historical or scenic interest and value to the
city and its residents when manufactured homes are installed which are
incompatible and unsuitable, and proper design and development standards and
criteria are not applied. Such areas are irreplaceable and the City Council
finds they are of such value and significance that extraordinary measures are
justified and required in order to protect them.
(Ord. 41-83, passed 5-9-83)
§ 152.09 MANUFACTURED HOMES MORE THAN 10 YEARS OLD.

compliance with the standards established in the City Code of Ordinances.
   (C)   Any person desiring to transfer ownership of a manufactured home
shall, at least 30 days prior to the change in ownership, notify the
Engineering Department in writing. The Engineering Department shall conduct an
inspection of the manufactured home to determine whether or not said
manufactured home is in compliance with the standards established in the City
Code of Ordinances.
   (D)   The Engineering Department shall notify, in writing, the person
seeking a change in ownership of the decision relative to the compliance with
the standards established in the City Code of Ordinances.
   (E)   A person who disagrees with the decision of the Engineering Department
relative to the determination of compliance with the standards established in
the City Code of Ordinance shall have the right to file an appeal to the Office
of the Service/Safety Director. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall be
filed with the Office of the Service/Safety Director within 15 days of the
receipt of the notice of the Engineering Department.
   (F)   The Office of the Service/Safety Director shall, after a review of the
appeal, render a decision, in writing, within 15 days, and forward the same to

(`63 Code, § 1111.02)
Penalty, see § 153.99
Statutory reference:
   Approval without plat, see R.C. § 711.131
   Plat approval required, see R.C. § 711.09
§ 153.03 CONVEYING BY LOTS; APPROVAL WITHOUT PLAT.
   Except as provided in R.C. § 711.131, no part of any tract of land in the
city or territory shall be conveyed by metes and bounds, but only by lot number
according to a plat duly prepared, executed, approved by the Planning
Commission and by such other persons or officers as the law requires, and
recorded according to law. If a lot or parcel of land along an existing public
street or road shall be divided without platting in accordance with R.C. §
711.131, then not more than one of the lots resulting from the division may be
laid out at the rear of another of the lots so as to have no frontage of less
than 60 feet on the public street, but any such lot shall not be conveyed
without access by right-of-way or otherwise to the public street for ingress
and egress and utilities. The City Engineer is designated as the official
representative of the Commission for the purpose of applying the provisions of
R.C. § 711.131 and approving conveyances of parcels not requiring platting.

Penalty, see § 153.99
§ 153.04 STREET PATTERNS; DEAD-END STREETS.
   The street pattern of all subdivisions shall provide for ease of circulation
of traffic within the subdivision as well as convenient access to adjoining
streets, thoroughfares, or unsubdivided land. Reserve strips at the edge of
subdivisions controlling access to the streets thereof from land adjoining the
subdivision shall be prohibited. In any case where a street will eventually be
extended beyond the plat but is temporarily dead-ended, an interim turn-around
will be required. Dead-end streets will be permitted in cases where the
Planning Commission finds that the street will be for the best interest of the
city, considering the topography of the area and all other relevant factors, if
a circular roadway is provided at the end thereof so that vehicles may be
easily turned around without backing.
(`63 Code, § 1111.04)
Penalty, see § 153.99
§ 153.05 WIDTH OF STREETS.
   All new streets on the plat of any subdivision shall have a minimum right-
of-way width of 50 feet; but if in the opinion of the Planning Commission the
prospective traffic load of any such street justifies a greater width, the
Commission may in its discretion require a greater width for the street.
(`63 Code, § 1111.05)
Penalty, see § 153.99
§ 153.06 SIZE OF LOTS.
   All lots on the plat of any subdivision shall have a minimum street frontage
of 60 feet, and a minimum area of 7,500 square feet, except that smaller
frontages may be approved for individual lots fronting on curved streets where
the width of any such lot increases going from front to rear, and where the
width of the lot at the probable location of the dwelling house to be built
thereon is not less than 60 feet. Provided, however, that the Planning
Commission may, in its discretion, approve the plat of a subdivision in an old
established neighborhood of the city not involving any new streets, containing
lots of less width than 60 feet if the lots, conform generally to the other
lots in the neighborhood. Provided further, however, that if it appears that
any subdivision will not be served within a reasonable time by a public

APPLICABILITY
§ 155.0201 GENERAL APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER.
   No structure, or part thereof, shall be placed upon or moved onto land,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered, nor
shall any building or land be used or occupied which does not comply with the
district regulations established by this chapter for the district in which the
building, structure, and/or land is located.
   (A)   Lot size requirements and the subdivision of land. No parcel of land
held under one ownership, with or without a building, at the time this chapter
became effective, shall be reduced, nor shall any such parcel be subdivided in
any manner below the minimum lot width and lot area required by this chapter.
   (B)   Reductions in yard requirements. No building may be enlarged which
would result in decreasing a minimum yard requirement below the requirements of
the applicable zoning district.
   (C)   Location of uses on a single lot. Unless otherwise specifically
allowed, every principal building hereafter erected, relocated, or structurally
altered shall be located on a single lot as herein defined.
   (D)   Unsafe buildings. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition, any structure or part thereof
declared unsafe by a proper authority as long as such strengthening or
restoration is no more than necessary to preserve the integrity of the
building.
   (E)   Conversion of dwellings. The conversion of any building into a

§ 155.0301 ZONING MAP.
   The location and boundaries of zoning districts are shown on the map titled

(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
§ 155.0302 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the zoning
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Parallel district boundaries. Where district boundaries appear to be
approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets or the
center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall
be construed as parallel thereto and at such distance therefore as indicated on
the Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by
the use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
   (B)   Boundaries of zoning districts. Boundaries of zoning districts are
intended to follow property lines. Where zoning district boundaries are shown
as being parallel to a right-of-way, those lots that have frontage on such
right-of-way are intended to be within such a zoning district.
   (C)   Lot lines, railroad lines, and waterways. Where district boundaries
approximately follow lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed as a boundary
of a zoning district. Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line,
such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle of the main tracks of
said railroad line. Where the boundary of a district follows (or parallels) a
waterway, such boundary shall be deemed to be located in the middle (or
parallel to) the centerline of said waterway.
   (D)   Interpretation by Planning and Zoning Commission. Any questions of
interpretation of the Zoning Map which cannot otherwise be resolved, shall be
referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for determination in accordance
with §
155.2504.

PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT    DISTRICT (PD-RS, PD-MX)
§ 155.1501 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the PD Planned Development District is to achieve, to the
greatest possible degree, land development that is responsive to the natural
and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site. The PD provides an
alternative zoning category that is intended to encourage imaginative design of
development. The PD should be a well-integrated development in terms of major
design elements such as roads, drainage systems, utilities, and open space. The
PD allows greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected
and development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
§ 155.1502 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND PD DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
   Subsequent to the approval of the City Council, the designation of PD may be
applied to any existing zoning district with the limitations described herein.
There are two types of PDs. A PD may be a predominantly residential
development, in which case is referred to as a PD-RS. A PD-RS may only be
applied to an existing residential district. A PD may also be a mixed use
development, referred to as a PD-MX. A PD-MX may be applied to any existing
nonresidential zoning district. Upon the approval of the final development plan
according to this section, the Zoning Map shall be amended to designate the
property "PD-RS" or "PD-MX." The tract of land proposed to be developed as a
PD-MX must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or single entity and
must be at least five contiguous acres in size. The tract of land proposed to
be developed as a PD-RS must be owned, leased, or controlled by one person or
single entity and must be at least five contiguous acres in size.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
Penalty, see § 155.2617
§ 155.1503 PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses in both the PD-RS and PD-MX district are as set forth
below:
   (A)   Permitted uses - PD-RS. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of permitted or conditional uses in any existing residential district,
as well as permitted use in the NC Neighborhood Commercial district, provided
that not more than 25% of the net acres in the development is devoted to
nonresidential uses.
   (B)   Permitted uses - PD-MX. An applicant may propose to include any
mixture of nonresidential land uses in a proposed PD-MX development, provided
that at least 60% of the net acres in the development are devoted to uses
permitted in the district(s) applying to the property at the time of
application.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
Penalty, see § 155.2617
§ 155.1504 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following standards represent broad parameters under which all PD
developments must be designed:
   (A)   Central water and wastewater facilities. All structures in
developments approved as a PD must be served by central or public water and
wastewater facilities.
   (B)   Development layout and design. The design and layout of all PDs shall
display excellence in design by properly considering significant site features
such as topography, natural drainage patterns, roadway access and circulation,
surrounding land uses, and general public welfare, to result in desirable land
development. Attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between
incompatible land use and activities.
   (C)   Front, side, and rear setback standards for perimeter lots. All lots
that are located along the perimeter of the PD shall have minimum front, side,
and rear setbacks equal to those that would normally be specified in the zoning
district prevailing at the time of application for PD approval, or 25 feet,
whichever is greater.
   (D)   Off-street parking and loading facilities. For all land uses located
within the PD, the parking and loading standards contained in §§
155.2101 through
155.2119 shall be applied.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)

§ 155.1505 RESIDENTIAL (PD-RS) DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
   In addition to the general development standards described in §
155.1504, residential PDs shall meet the following development standards:
   (A)   Clustering residential development and required open space. Clustering
residential density is encouraged to provide required common open space. A
minimum of 20% of the land developed for residential purposes in a PD-RS
project shall be reserved for common open space. This required amount of common
space shall be established as common open space under one ownership, and
provisions shall be established for maintenance and care. The legal articles
relating to any organization of property owners in the development charged with
such open space maintenance shall be submitted to the city. The City Council
may require as a condition of final approval, any evidence deemed necessary to
document that the required common space will remain in its stated condition as
long as the development exists, including such legal documents as deed
restrictions, conservation easements, and the like.
   (B)   Clustering residential density. To achieve a clustering of residential
density and to provide for the required common open space, the lot area
requirements for residential land uses may be reduced from the densities
required under the district(s) applying to the property at the time of
application by up to 20%. The lot, width, and yard requirements for residential
lots may be also be reduced as needed to accommodate a variety of structural
patterns, clustering designs, and housing types.
   (C)   Residential dwelling types. Along with clustering residential density,
a PD-RS may include a mixture of dwelling types, including single-family
detached dwellings, two-family units, zero lot line units, and multiple-family
units, provided the maximum densities defined in each existing zoning
classification is not exceeded.

§ 155.1610 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (A)   The continuance of an existing sign which does not meet the
regulations and requirements of this subchapter shall be deemed a nonconforming
sign which shall terminate by abandonment. A sign shall be considered
abandoned:
      (1)   When the sign is associated with an abandoned use.

maintained by the owner or person in charge thereof, in a clean, sanitary, and
inoffensive condition, free and clear of all obnoxious substances, rubbish, and
weeds.
      (4)   Abandonment shall be determined based upon the above definitions at
a public hearing. Upon a finding that the signage is abandoned, the right to
maintain and use such sign shall terminate immediately.
   (B)   A nonconforming sign shall not be structurally relocated or replaced
unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.
   (C)   A nonconforming sign shall be maintained or repaired in accordance
with the following provisions:
      (1)   The site and structural shape shall not be changed or altered. The
copy may be changed provided that the change applies to the original
nonconforming use associated with the sign and that the change is made by the
owner of the sign at the time the sign became nonconforming. The copy area
shall not be enlarged. Any subsequent owner or user shall bring the sign into
compliance within 30 days.
      (2)   In case damage occurs to the sign to the extent of 50% or more of

§ 155.1613 DESIGN CONTROL.
   Design controls defined within the Downtown Historical District are created
to maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Downtown Historical
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures within it, and to prevent intrusions and alternations within the
District, such as parking lots and open space use that would be incompatible
with this established character.

§ 155.1614 PLANS SUBJECT TO REVIEW.
   Plans to make changes to the exterior of structures or other environmental
features in the Downtown Historical District are subject to review by the
Architectural Review and Design Commission using the Rickey Report as a
standard of historic reference. The Rickey Report is a study done of this
particular area by outside consultants and is available for public inspection

§ 155.1615 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATION.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change to the exterior
surface of structures or to the other environmental feature of the district,
including treescaping and exterior signage and lighting, the Commission shall
consider the following:
   (A)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure, or site and their environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided.
   (B)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent to the original integrity of the
building shall be discouraged.
   (C)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure, or site shall be maintained and used
as major guideposts for the style of the building.
   (D)   Significant architectural features that have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition and design.
Repair or replacement of architectural features shall be based on accurate
duplications of features, and substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on a conjectural design or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (E)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials are to
be avoided.
   (F)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
   (G)   When alterations and additions to existing buildings are compatible
with size, scale, color, material, and character of the property and
environment they shall not be discouraged if they do not destroy significant
historical architectural materials or alter the intended era of the structure.
   (H)   New additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a
manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired.
   (I)   Any alterations to trees in the Downtown Historical District can only
be made by permission of Architectural Review and Design Commission, except for
the yearly maintenance and replacing by the Beautification Council.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
Penalty, see § 155.2617
§ 155.1616 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Existing structures and premises. Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Downtown Historical District shall conform to the distinguishing
original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site, and its
environment.
   (B)   New construction. The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material, and
color of other structures and premises within the Downtown Historical District.
   (C)   Materials.
      (1)   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures within the Downtown Historical District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials, such as brick, stone, masonry, and wood.
      (2)   Contemporary materials could be used if they would contribute to
the preservation or enhancement of existing integrity and new structure and be
architecturally harmonious.
   (D)   Color. Traditional colors, and combinations of those colors that are
both identified with the origin or the era in which the Downtown Historical
District was originally built and approved by the Architectural Review and
Design Commission, shall be used for building exteriors for all new
construction, reconstruction, remodeling, and exterior maintenance of existing
structures within the Downtown Historical District.
   (E)   Signs. All signs are to be in compliance with §§
155.1602 through
155.1617.

§ 155.1617 PROCEDURE FOR ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW; APPROVAL CERTIFICATE.
   (A)   A certificate of approval is required from the Architectural Review
and Design Commissioner prior to any new construction, remodeling,
reconstruction, or demolition, as well as for any exterior changes to the
building that may devalue it as an asset to the historical community of
downtown Cambridge.
   (B)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property within the Downtown Historical District.
   (C)   Applications for certificate of approval shall be filed with the
Architectural Review and Design Commission at least 15 days before a meeting of
the Commission. The applicant shall submit with the application, drawings,
materials, and color samples, and any other aids that would assist the
Commission in understanding the wishes of the applicant.
   (D)   The Commission shall review and, within 15 days, grant a certificate,
disapprove an application, or approve an application with modification.

   All applications for a variance shall be made directly to the Planning and
Zoning Commission upon forms as prescribed by the Commission in accordance with
§
155.1803. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the power to grant
variances from the provisions and requirements of this subchapter which will
not be contrary to the public interest or the intent and purpose of this
subchapter, but only where, owing to special conditions pertaining to a
specific piece of property, the strict application of provisions to
requirements of this subchapter would cause undue or unnecessary hardship.

is developed with smaller front setbacks. Specifically, when a vacant parcel is
proposed to be developed and existing principle structures on either side of
the subject property have setbacks that are lesser distances than would be
normally required, then the applicable setback for the subject property may be
reduced by an amount that would not exceed the average of those existing
structures within 100 feet of the subject property (on the same side of the
street). This determination shall be made by the Zoning Inspector without the
need for a variance.

§ 155.1703 SUPPLEMENTAL YARD AND HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   In addition to all yard regulations specified in other sections of this
chapter, the provisions included in this section shall be used for
interpretation and clarification.
   (A)   Yard setback requirements for corner buildings. On a corner lot in any
district the main building and any accessory structures shall be required to
have the same setback distance from all street right-of-way lines as required
for the front yard in the district in which such structures are located. The
remaining yards shall be considered side yards.
   (B)   Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any district, nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as to
materially impede vision between a height of 2½ feet and 10 feet above the
center line grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the
right-of-way of such corner lots and a line joining points along the right-of-
way 25 feet from the point of intersection.
   (C)   Yard setbacks for multiple- family or group of dwellings. A group of
dwellings or multiple-family dwellings shall be considered as one building for
the purpose of determining front, side, and rear yard requirements. The entire
group as a unit shall require one front, one rear, and two side yards as
specified for dwellings in the appropriate district. In addition to the front,
side, and rear yards, all individual buildings shall be separated by a distance
equal to the building height of the largest building.
   (D)   Additional yard requirements for buffering purposes. To secure a
desirable transition between land zoned for residential purposes and other
zoning districts (CI through OMC), it is required that greater yard setbacks be
provided on the property that is not zoned for residential purposes along the
lot line(s) that abut land zoned for residential purposes. When property that
is zoned CI through OMC abuts property that is zoned to permit single-, two-,
or multiple-family residential dwellings, the yard requirements for that yard
adjacent to the residentially zoned property shall be increased two times over
the normally required yard setback (including any overlay district
requirements), up to a maximum of 75 feet, and a landscaped buffer yard shall
be provided in this area in accordance with §§
155.2401 through
155.2406 with conditional exception to additional requirements of corner lots
discussed in division (A) of this section.
   (E)   Accessory structures. Accessory structures may not be located closer
to a public right-of-way than the principal structure unless the accessory
structure is attached to the principal structure. Accessory structures shall
not be located closer to a public right-of-way than a distance equal to one-
half of the height of the accessory structure or three feet, whichever is
greater.

CONDITIONAL USES, VARIANCES AND APPEALS
§ 155.1801 PURPOSE.
   Most types of land use covered by this Zoning Code are grouped according to
compatibility and function, and each group is permitted outright in one or more
of the various districts established in the Zoning Code. In addition to these
permitted uses, there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to
allow in certain districts but because of their potential impact on adjacent
land or public facilities, need particular and individual consideration prior
to location in the community. Such uses are classified in this Zoning Code as
"conditional uses." Also included within the category of conditional uses are
uses municipally operated or operated by publicly-regulated utilities and uses
traditionally affected by public interest.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
Penalty, see § 155.2617
§ 155.1802 PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a conditional use is
proposed, shall make an application for a conditional use permit by filing it
with the Zoning Inspector. After reviewing the application and determining that
the application is complete, the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the
application to the Planning and Zoning Commission, along with other agencies
and organizations deemed necessary. If all information required is not
provided, the Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the applicant of the items
needed. Within 30 days following the determination that the application is
complete, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing.
Notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general
circulation in the city at least ten days before the date of said hearing. The
notice shall set forth the time and place of the hearing and shall provide a
summary explanation of the conditional use proposed. Notice of this public
hearing shall also be sent to all owners of property within 300 feet of the
property in question. Following the hearing, but within 30 days after the
determination that the application is complete, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall make a decision. The decision may be appealed by any
interested party in writing to City Council if such appeal is made within 30
days following the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission. The written
appeal must be filed with the City Clerk. On receipt of the written appeal, the
Council shall discuss the appeal at a second public hearing and shall make a
decision whether to grant the conditional use.
   (A)   General standards for all conditional uses. The Planning and Zoning
Commission shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each proposed
conditional use in terms finding that the proposed conditional use:
      (1)   Is in fact a conditional use as established under the provisions of
the applicable zoning district.
      (2)   Will be in accordance with the general objectives or with any
specific objectives of the Master Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Is designed, constructed, operated, and would be maintained so as
to be harmonious with the existing or intended character of the general
vicinity and that such use will not change the essential character of the same
area.
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses.
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services.
      (6)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare, or odors.
   (B)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. In granting approval for any
conditional use, the Planning and Zoning Commission may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformance with this chapter. Any violation of
such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
conditional use is granted, shall be deemed a punishable violation of this
chapter. Examples of appropriate conditions and safeguards include:
      (1)   Larger buffer areas between the proposed conditional use and
adjacent property.
      (2)   Greater yard requirements.
      (3)   Limits on the location or illumination of signs.
      (4)   Limits on where parking areas may be located.
   (C)   Expiration of conditional use permit. A conditional use permit shall
be deemed to authorize only one particular conditional use, and said permit
shall automatically expire if such conditional use has not been instituted or
utilized within one year of the date on which the permit was issued or if for
any reason such use shall cease for more than two years.
(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
§ 155.1803 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (A)   Appeals.  
      (1)   Appeals to Commission. Appeals to the Planning and Zoning
Commission concerning interpretation or administration of this chapter may be
taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer or bureau of the legislative
authority of the city affected by any decision of the Zoning Inspector. Such
appeal shall be taken within 20 days after the decision by filing with the
Zoning Inspector and with the Planning and Zoning Commission, a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds upon which the appeal is being taken. The Zoning
Inspector shall transmit to the Planning and Zoning Commission all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
      (2)   Stay of proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance
of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector, by reason of facts
stated in the application, finds that a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Planning and Zoning Commission by a court of record.
   (B)   Variances.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may authorize a variance from
the terms of this chapter which shall not be contrary to the public interest
and, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions
of this chapter would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (2)   A variance shall not be granted unless the Planning and Zoning
Commission makes a specific finding based directly on the particular evidence
presented to it which supports conclusions that the standards and conditions
imposed by this section have been met by the applicant.
      (3)   No variance shall be granted which will alter the character and use
of a zoning district or to correct an error of judgment in zoning laws.
      (4)   Application and standards for variances. Except as otherwise
permitted in this chapter, a variance from the terms of this Zoning Code shall
not be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning Inspector and the
Planning and Zoning Commission. At a minimum, the application shall include:
         (a)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant(s).
         (b)   Legal description of property.
         (c)   Description of nature of variance requested.
         (d)   A list of all property owners and their addresses who are
within, contiguous to, or directly across the street, and may have interest in
the variance.
         (e)   A narrative statement that the requested variance conforms to
the following standards:
            1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
            2.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this
chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this chapter.
            3.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
            4.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (C)   Public hearing by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and
Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing within 20 days after the receipt
of an application for an appeal or variance from the Zoning Inspector or an
applicant.
   (D)   Notice of public hearing in newspaper. Before holding the public
hearing required in division (C) of this section, notice of such hearing shall
be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the city, at least
ten days prior to the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time
and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed appeal or
variance.
   (E)   Notice to parties of interest. Prior to conducting the public hearing
required in division (C) of this section, written notice of such hearing shall
be mailed by the Chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission, by first
class mail at least ten days before the day of the hearing, to all property
owners of adjoining parcels or parcels within 300 feet of the affected
property. The notice shall contain the same information as required of notices
published in newspapers as specified in division (D) of this section.
   (F)   Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (1)   Within 30 days after the public hearing required in division (C) of
this section, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall either approve, approve
with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the request for appeal or
variance.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall further make a finding in
writing that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of
the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the land, building, or
structure. A copy of this decision shall be transmitted to the applicant and
the Zoning Inspector.
      (3)   Appeals from Planning and Zoning Commission decisions shall be made
in the manner specified in this section.
   (G)   Supplementary conditions and safeguards. Under no circumstances shall
the Planning and Zoning Commission grant an appeal or variance to allow a use
not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the district involved, or
any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in
said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may prescribe any appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this chapter. Violations of such conditions and safeguards,
when made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance has been
granted, shall be deemed a violation and punishable under §
155.2617.

   (A)   The lawful use of any dwelling, building, or structure on any lot or
premises existing and lawful at the time of the enactment of this chapter,
supplement, or amendment may continue although such use does not conform with
the provisions of this chapter or any supplement or amendment made after the
enactment of this chapter. A nonconforming use of a building may be changed to
another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification,
provided that any structural improvements to the building do not exceed 50% of
the fair market value of the structure. Whenever a nonconforming use has been
changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not be
changed thereafter to a less restricted use.
   (B)   In the event that a nonconforming use of any dwelling, building, or
structure and of any lot or premises is voluntarily discontinued for a period
of two years or more, any future use of the lot, building, or structure shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (C)   Without prior approval, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout
that portion of a structure that was obviously designed and intended for such
use.
   (D)   When a nonconforming building or structure has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy to the extent of more than 75%
of its fair market value, it shall not be restored or reconstructed except in
conformity with regulations of the zoning district in which the building or
structure is located.
   (E)   When a nonconforming use qualifies for reconstruction through damage
(less than 75% of its fair market value), a building permit shall be secured
for that purpose and reconstruction shall be diligently completed without
delay. Failure to reconstruct within a year of damage revokes the right to the
nonconforming use and the premises shall conform thereafter to the established
district regulations.
   (F)   A use in violation of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance which
this chapter amends or of a zoning ordinance covering an area of a city or
township subsequently annexed to the city shall not be validated by the

single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this
chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district. Variances of requirements other than lot
area or lot width shall be obtained only through action of the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (B)   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands
involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this
chapter, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this
chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with
a width or area below the requirements stated in this chapter.

§ 155.2202 ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   General standards for parking areas, circulation, and access shall be
incorporated as part of the site plan. These standards are found in §§
155.2101 through
155.2119. As part of the site plan review process, access shall be reviewed
relative to the distance from other drive approaches and from roadway
intersections. The preferred method of providing access to parcels is to
minimize or eliminate driveways by using service roads, rear access roads, or
shared driveways. The Planning and Zoning Commission or Zoning Inspector may,
as part of the site plan review process, require that driveways be moved,
combined, re-aligned, or eliminated to reduce the potential for accidents.
   (A)   Conditional approval of driveways. As part of the site plan review
process, the Planning and Zoning Commission or Zoning Inspector may approve a
site plan with a specific driveway location with the condition that an
agreement be first entered into between the property owner and the city,
requiring that if a service road is constructed in the future, or if the
opportunity for a shared driveway should present itself with development of
adjacent property, one or more approved driveways shall be closed and
measurements taken to utilize such service road or shared drive. Approval of
driveways may also include restrictions on turning movements, locations, or
other requirements to ensure safe and efficient traffic movement.
   (B)   Construction and use of service roads. When a service road is
required, such improvement shall be constructed by the developer of the
involved property before any occupancy or use permit is granted. When a service
road is provided, all access to an adjacent property shall use that service
road and no direct access to the main thoroughfare shall be provided.

expected trip generation of the use is 100 or more cars per hour as identified
in the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) Manual. A traffic impact study
shall be prepared by a qualified professional engineer at the developer's
expense. The traffic impact study shall investigate the feasibility and
benefits of improvements such as signals, turn lanes, driveway movement
limitations, and other relevant information to the site to protect the safety
of the traveling public. The traffic impact study shall include the following
elements:
   (A)   A description of the site and study area.
   (B)   Anticipated development of adjacent parcels.

§ 155.2204 PROCEDURE FOR SITE PLAN REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   Formal submission and approval of a site plan is required before
any zoning permit may be issued. Formal submission and approval of a site plan
includes following the review procedures and submission requirements defined
herein. Notwithstanding these requirements, however, at any time prior to the
formal submission and review of a site plan, an applicant may at his or her
option submit a sketch site plan for informal review and comment. The purpose
of such a sketch site plan is to provide an opportunity to conceptually discuss
a proposed development and to provide general guidance to assist in the
preparation of a formal site plan. A sketch site plan need not include all
items described in division (D) of this section, and informal review of the
site plan need not include the notifications required under division (B) of
this section.
      (2)   Site plans that include less than 100 new parking spaces shall be
reviewed, approved, disapproved, or approved with modifications by the City
Engineer in accordances with the standards contained in this chapter. Site
plans that include 100 or more new parking spaces and/or if a traffic study is
required pursuant to §
155.2203 shall be reviewed, approved, disapproved, or approved with
modifications by the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance with the
standards contained in this chapter and after consideration of the
recommendation by the City Engineer.
      (3)   An applicant for formal site plan approval shall file ten copies of
a plan with the Zoning Inspector along with other required documents and an
application fee. For developments also requiring conditional use approval, the
procedure established in §§
155.1801 through
155.1803 shall be followed. The Planning and Zoning Commission may concurrently
address the issue of site plan approval and conditional use approval.
      (4)   After reviewing an application for formal site plan approval for
completeness and determining that the application and site plan is complete,
the Zoning Inspector shall transmit copies of the site plan to individual
departments and agencies. If all information required is not provided, the
Zoning Inspector shall promptly notify the applicant of the items needed.
Within 30 days following the determination that the application is complete,
one of the following actions shall be taken:
         (a)   Approval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed plan will constitute a suitable development and the plan meets the
standards set forth in this chapter.
         (b)   Disapproval of the site plan based upon a determination that the
proposed project does not meet the standards for review set forth in division
(C) of this section.
         (c)   Approval of the site plan subject to any conditions,
modifications, and restrictions as required to ensure that the project meets
the standards for review.
      (5)   If the site plan is disapproved, the specific basis for such
disapproval shall be provided, along with a clear description of how the site
plan could be modified to be approved. Any resubmission of a site plan need
only be submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review, after
adjoining property owners previously notified have been provided ten days
notice by first class mail of such a subsequent meeting. Appeals from
Commission decisions may be made in the manner specified in §

(Ord. 37-02, passed 7-10-02)
§ 155.2406 INTERIOR PARKING AREA LANDSCAPING.
   Landscaping within parking areas whether ground cover or upright plant
material is necessary not only to reduce the generation of heat and water
runoff but to break up visually the expanse of paved areas. The use of parking
islands or peninsulas strategically placed throughout the parking lot is
required to landscape parking lot interiors. The use of shade trees in these
landscape areas is encouraged. Any open parking area containing more than 6,000
square feet of area or 15 or more parking spaces shall provide the following
interior landscaping in addition to the required perimeter screening:
   (A)   An area equal to 5% of the total area devoted to parking spaces and
parking lanes shall be landscaped and permeable.
   (B)   Whenever possible, large parking areas of 30,000 square feet or larger
shall be designed so as to break up their visual expanse and create the
appearance of smaller parking lots. This distinction or separation can be
achieved by interspersing yard space and buildings in strategic areas and by
taking advantage of natural features such as slope, existing woodland or
vegetation, drainage courses, and retention areas.
   (C)   Landscaping in parking areas shall be dispersed throughout in
peninsulas or islands. The minimum island or peninsula size shall be 180 square
feet with a two foot minimum distance between all trees or shrubs, and the edge
of pavement where vehicles overhang shall have a minimum width of 10 feet.
Islands shall typically be located every 10 to 12 parking spaces and may be
curbed. This section shall exclude the CI District.
   (D)   The required plant materials for the interior of parking areas shall
be one deciduous tree for every 3,000 square feet. Where site distance or
maneuvering conflicts exist, trees shall have a clear trunk of at least five
feet above the ground and the remaining required landscape areas shall be
planted with shrubs or ground cover not to exceed two feet in height.

§ 158.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Contained herein are policies and regulations for the location and design of
commercial driveways to be placed on a city right of way by highway use permits
and as a design guide for highway construction projects.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
§ 158.02 AUTHORITY.
   Highway use permits for the use or occupancy of a city street right of way
may be granted, upon formal application, by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
§ 158.03 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   A driveway permit shall be obtained before construction or development
begins within any area of the city-highway right of way. Application for a
driveway permit shall be made on forms furnished by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
§ 158.04 PREPARATION OF APPLICATION PLAN.
   The applicant is responsible for the preparation of a detailed plan to
accompany the permit application. The plan submitted becomes a part of the
permit record and shall contain information sufficient to accomplish the
following:
   (A)   To permit all reviewing authorities to make an intelligent and
conclusive review of the application.
   (B)   To enable the contractor to construct the proposed facility in
accordance with the terms of the permit.
   (C)   To enable the individual responsible for inspection to insure that the
facility is constructed in accordance with the terms of the permit.
   (D)   To serve as a record of the construction authorized by the City
Engineer.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
§ 158.05 GENERAL CRITERIA.
   (A)   Number of driveways permitted. When adequate frontage is available,
two driveways to a property having a single business may be permitted. When two
or more businesses are located on a single property and two driveways cannot
provide adequate access, more than two drives may be permitted. Each request
for more than two drives shall be accompanied by sufficient information to
justify the request.
   (B)   Joint driveways.  A jointly owned driveway may be permitted upon joint
application by both property owners.
   (C)   Location of Driveways at Highway Intersections. New driveways shall
not begin closer to an existing highway intersection than that permitted in §§
158.07 to
158.16. The proximity of a new highway intersection to existing driveways shall
conform to the Corner Island criteria set forth in §
158.09. It shall be the responsibility of the permit applicant to make all
necessary arrangements and agreements with the affected property owners when
the relocation of existing driveways is necessary. The expense involved shall
be borne by the applicant.
   (D)   Right-Of-Way Use Prohibitions. No parking, servicing of vehicles,
erection of lights, signs or other advertising devices shall be permitted on a
highway right of way; similarly, no device or structure shall be permitted to
overhang a highway right of way. Provisions shall be made in the design of
driveways or approaches, such that a vehicle will not be required to back onto
the right of way or through the highway pavement to gain access to the highway.
   (E)   Future Highway Improvement Controls. When the extent of future highway
improvements can be determined, the location and design of driveways or public
road approaches shall be governed by the right-of-way lines, pavement edges,
intersection radii and elevations of the future highway facility.
   (F)   Encroachment of Driveway on Adjacent Frontage. A permit may be issued
for the construction of a driveway which encroaches on the abutting property
frontage in excess of the controls set forth in §§
158.07 to
158.16 only when written permission from the affected property owner is
presented and made a part of the city's record of the permit and only when such
encroachment does not interfere with an existing driveway.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
§ 158.06 DRIVEWAY DESIGN CRITERIA.

away from the through pavement edge at the same rate of slope as the highway
shoulder slope and shall be so constructed that no surface water will be
drained onto the highway pavement.
   (B)   Widths. Driveway widths shall be measured perpendicular to the
driveway centerline and shall not normally exceed a width of 35 feet. A width
greater than 35 feet may be permitted for driveways having traffic volumes
which exceed the capacity of a 35 foot driveway width.
   (C)   Intersection Angle.
      (1)   70° to 90° - Single driveway (Two-way traffic).
      (2)   45° to 90° - Dual driveways.
   (D)   Radii (Type 1 Drive - Standard Drawing BP-6). Radii shall not be less
than:
      (1)   Fifteen feet when the through highway is curbed.
      (2)   Twenty-five feet when the through highway is uncurbed.
   (E)   Curbing.
      (1)   Driveways abutting curbed highways may be curbed. The highway curb
shall be depressed to a two-inch height across the driveway opening.
      (2)   Driveways abutting uncurbed highways may be curbed; however, the
curb shall not extend closer to the through pavement edge than eight feet.
(Ord. 116-87, passed 12-28-87)
SERVICE STATION DRIVEWAYS
§ 158.07 PURPOSE.

      (1)   If feasible, the distance from the proposed driveway to the nearest
existing or proposed traffic signal on a highway or street, within one mile,
shall be a multiple of the critical spacing for a progressive signal system.
The critical space is calculated by the following formula:
X = S (½ C) 1.47
where
X = critical space in feet
S = approach speed, 50th percentile, MPH
C = total cycle of existing signal in seconds
      In applying the critical space, a tolerance of 10% plus or minus is
acceptable.
      (2)   A new driveway shall not be located where it will create an offset
intersection opposite an existing street, highway or major commercial driveway.
      (3)   A driveway serving all directions of traffic shall be located a
minimum of 600 feet from the nearest major highway or street intersection.

with 12 feet preferred.
      (6)   Major driveways in shopping centers shall be constructed to prevent
cross movement of internal traffic within 100 feet of the entrance approach.
This may be accomplished by use of a raised divider, six inches high, six feet
wide minimum and 100 feet long and/or by use of curbing, sidewalk or other
barrier along the drive edges for a length of 100 feet.
      (7)   Driveways designed for traffic signal operation shall have curbed
radii and shall provide a minimum of two lanes for vehicles entering a city
highway.

      (1)   The developer of the area shall not cause any diversion of flow to
the highway.
      (2)   The developer of the area shall not increase flow peaks from areas
contributing to the highway unless the highway drainage system and the drainage
system downstream from the highway area are of adequate capacity to convey the
augmented flow. If downstream, capacity is inadequate, the developer shall
provide adequate flow detention or increase the capacity of the downstream
system.
      (3)   When the developer collects and concentrates surface water, or
increases flow peaks or volumes contributing to this highway, he shall provide
adequate measures to prevent erosion and/or structural damage of the downstream
system.
      (4)   The developer of the area shall provide adequate erosion control
measures during construction to minimize downstream sedimentation.

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 161.10 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of these sign regulations is to encourage the proper development
and use or planned graphic signing systems and to regulate signs and signing
systems in the Downtown Historical District. In addition to protecting from
distractions and obstructions that can contribute to traffic and pedestrian
accidents, it is the intent of these regulations that signs are as much subject
to control as noise, odors, debris and like characteristics of a use that, if
not controlled and regulated, can become a nuisance factor to adjacent
properties or the community in general. To protect the general health, safety
and welfare, and to protect and encourage a more attractive economic, business
and overall physical appearance or the community, all signs and signing systems
are subject to the regulations that follow in this subchapter.

§ 161.16 VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
   All applications for a sign variance shall be made directly to the Planning
Commission upon forms as prescribed by the Commission. The Planning Commission
shall have the power to make recommendations to Council for sign variances from
the provisions and requirements of this subchapter which will not be contrary
to the public interest or the intent and purpose of this subchapter, but only
where, owning to special conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property,
the strict application of provisions to requirements of this subchapter would
cause undue or unnecessary hardship. No such variance shall be recommended by
the Planning Commission unless the Planning Commission, after holding a public
hearing on the application, determines that the following conditions have been
met.
   (A)   The granting of the variance is in accord with the general purpose of
this subchapter.
   (B)   The granting of the variance is not injurious to the area or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
   (C)   There exist special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the findings, applicable to the property for which the variance is sought,
which do not apply generally to the property in the Downtown Historical
District, and which, if the provisions of this subchapter were strictly
applied, would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of such property.
   (D)   The granting of the variances necessary for the reasonable use of the
property.
   (E)   Proof of hardship created by the strict application of this subchapter
is presented by the owner. The proof must show:
      (1)   The hardship results from the application of this subchapter.
      (2)   The hardship is not self-created.
      (3)   The hardship is unique to the property in question.
      (4)   The owner cannot reasonably use the property if the terms of this
subchapter are strictly applied. Showing that a greater profit would result if
the provisions of this subchapter were not strictly applied does not prove
hardship under the terms of this subchapter. Showing that the owner bought the
property in question without knowledge of the restrictions imposed by this
subchapter does not prove hardship under the terms of this subchapter.
   (B)   All recommendations of the Planning Commission shall be presented to
Council. Council shall act only on the recommendation as it comes from the
Planning Commission. A failure by Council to act on a recommendation of the
Planning Commission under this section within 60 days of the presentment of the
recommendation to Council shall constitute an affirmance of the recommendation
of the Planning Commission granting or denying the variance.

not including the bracing, framing and structural supports of the sign, unless
such support members are made part of the message or face the sign.
   (B)   Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces of
the sign shall be included in determining the area of the sign unless two
display faces join back to back, are parallel to each other and not more than
12 inches apart. See illustration below.

DESIGN CONTROL
§ 161.30 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Downtown Historical District 1880-1925 era is to maintain
and enhance the distinctive character of the Downtown Historical District by
safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period structures
within it, and to prevent intrusions and alternations within the district, such
as parking lots and open space use that would be incompatible with this
established character.
(Ord. 58-96, passed 7-22-96)
§ 161.31 PLANS SUBJECT TO REVIEW.
   Plans to make changes to the exterior of structures or other environmental
features in the Downtown Historical District are subject to review by the
Architectural Review and Design Commission using the Rickey Report as a
standard of historic reference. The Rickey Report is a study done of this
particular area by outside consultants and is available.
(Ord. 58-96, passed 7-22-96)
§ 161.32 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATION.
   In considering the appropriateness of any proposed change to the exterior
surface of structures or to the other environmental feature of the district,
including treescaping and exterior signage and lighting, the Commission shall
consider the following:
   (A)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a period
building, structure or site and their environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural
features should be avoided.
   (B)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance inconsistent to the original integrity of the
building shall be discouraged.
   (C)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be maintained and used
as major guideposts for the style of the building.
   (D)   Significant architectural features that have deteriorated shall be
repaired rather than replaced. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition and design.
Repair or replacement of architectural features shall be based on accurate
duplications of features, and substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on a conjectural design or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings or structures.
   (E)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with methods
designed to minimize damage to historic building materials. Sandblasting and
other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials are to
be avoided.
   (F)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
   (G)   When alterations and additions to existing buildings are compatible
with size, scale, color, material and character of the property and environment
they shall not be discouraged if they do not destroy significant historical
architectural materials or alter the intended era of the structure.
   (H)   New additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a
manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future,
the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired.
   (I)   Any alterations to trees in the Downtown Historical District can only
be made by permission of this Commission, except for the yearly maintenance and
replacing by the Beautification Council.
(Ord. 58-96, passed 7-22-96)
§ 161.33 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Existing structures and premises. Reconstruction or rehabilitation
within the Downtown Historical District shall conform to the distinguishing
original exterior qualities or character of the structure, its site and its
environment.
   (B)   New construction. The design of new structures and of additions to
existing structures, including new site improvements, shall take into account
the architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture, material and
color of other structures and premises within the Downtown Historical District.

      (1)   All new structures and all reconstruction or remodeling of existing
structures within the Downtown Historical District shall utilize natural
traditional exterior materials such as brick, stone, masonry and wood.
      (2)   Contemporary materials could be used if they would contribute to
the preservation or enhancement of existing integrity and new structure and be
architecturally harmonious.
   (D)   Color. Traditional colors and combinations of those colors that are
both identified with the origin or the era in which the Downtown Historical
District was originally built, and approved by the Architectural Review and
Design Commission, shall be used for building exteriors for all new
construction, reconstruction, remodeling, and exterior maintenance of existing
structures within the Downtown Historical District.
   (E)   Signs. All signs are to be in compliance with §§
161.10 through
161.22.

(Ord. 65-97, passed 8-26-97)
§ 162.05 STANDARDS OF APPROVAL OF ALL CELLULAR OR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
ANTENNAS AND TOWERS.
   The following standards shall apply to all cellular or wireless
communications antennas and towers submitting application to the City
assignees:
   (A)   The person shall demonstrate, using the latest technological evidence,
why the antenna or tower must be placed in a proposed location in order to
serve its necessary function in the company's grid system. Part of the
demonstration shall include a drawing showing the boundaries of the area around
the proposed location which would probably also permit the antenna to function
properly in the company's grid system. The area shall be considered the
allowable zone.
   (B)   If the person proposes to build a cellular or wireless communications
tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), it is
required to demonstrate that it has contracted the owners of nearby tall
structures within the zoned district, asked for permission to install the
cellular communications antenna on those structures, and was denied for either
non-economic reasons or that a clearly unreasonable economic demand was made by
the owner, based on prevailing market values. “Tall Structures” shall include,
but not be limited to: smoke stacks, water towers, buildings over 35 feet in
height, antenna supporting structures or other cellular or wireless
communication companies, other communication towers. The City may deny the
application to construct a new cellular or wireless communication tower if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on existing
structure.
   (C)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the antenna/tower is no higher
than necessary to function satisfactorily and to accommodate the co-location
requirement. No antenna that is taller than the necessary height shall be
approved. Cellular or wireless towers shall be monopole construction unless it
is demonstrated that another type of tower is required for safety purposes.
   (D)   If a new cellular or wireless tower is to be constructed in an
industrial zoned district, the minimum distance between the base of the tower
or any guy wire anchors and any property line which abuts a zoning district
other than a residential area shall be no closer than the greater of the
following:
      (1)   40% of the tower height
      (2)   50 feet of the property line.
   (E)   (1)   All cellular or wireless communications towers shall be fitted
with anti-climbing devices as approved by the manufactures. The person applying
shall demonstrate that the proposed cellular or wireless communication tower
and its antenna are safe and that the surrounding properties will not be
negatively affected by tower failure, falling ice, or other debris,
electromagnetic fields or radio frequency interference. However, if a specific
safety issue in question is determined to be regulated by either FCC
regulations or applicable Building code regulations set out in
Chapter 150 of the XV Land Usage Ordinance, and the operation or construction
is in compliance with such regulations, then this requirement for safety shall
be deemed to have been met.
      (2)   If the installation and/or the operation of the cellular or
wireless communication tower site is determined by City Council, upon
presentation of proper and sufficient documentation; and after a public
hearing, that the operation of a cellular or wireless communications tower is
inherently dangerous or is a demonstrable health hazard, the cellular or
wireless tower shall be declared to be a nuisance and all operation shall
cease.
   (F)   An enclosed wood fence shall be required around the cellular or
wireless communication tower and its support structure(s) unless the antenna is
mounted on an existing structure. The enclosed wood fence shall be a minimum of
eight feet in height and shall be painted forest green and maintained yearly
for appropriate upkeep to city standards evaluated by City Safety Director,
City Engineer decisions at the time of annual City Regulations submittal.
   (G)   Landscaping in compliance with a plan approval by the City Safety
Director and City Engineer shall be provided to screen as much of the support
structure and ground level features as possible and such landscaping shall be
maintained and is subject to annual review during the Annual Registration
Process, January 1 of each year. In addition, existing vegetation (such as
trees and bushes) on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest
extent possible.

the City in the future, the owner of an existing cellular or wireless
communications tower shall not unreasonably deny a request to accommodate other
uses, including other cellular or wireless communication companies, and the
antenna of local police, fire and EMS department needs. The owner of the
existing cellular or wireless communications tower may request reasonable
compensation for the use of the tower.
   (B)   For the purpose of encouraging co-location of cellular and wireless
antenna and other uses, cellular or wireless communication towers shall be
designed, engineered, and constructed as follows, unless waived for good cause
to minimize impact on adjoining property by the Mayor, City Staff designee or
Planning Commission Chair.
      (1)   Towers less than 75 feet tall shall be designed, engineered and
constructed to handle one or more cellular or wireless communications service
users;
      (2)   Towers more than 75 feet in height but less than 150 feet shall be
designed, engineered and constructed to support antennas installed by two or
more wireless communication service users; and
      (3)   Towers 150 feet in height or taller shall be designed, engineered
and constructed to support antennas installed by three or more cellular or
wireless communications service users.
   (C)   As used in the above three points, the term USERS shall include the
antennas of police, fire and EMS departments. These governmental entities shall
not be considered “users” until their respective telecommunications antennas
and equipment are placed on the tower and a fee agreement for carriage has been
negotiated and approved by City Council. In addition, an applicant must
demonstrate that the area acquired for the use and construction of the cellular
tower and accessory structures is sufficient in size to accommodate any
additional structures that may be required if additional users are added to the
tower.

or will contract to have removed the facility and assess the owner/operator the
costs.
      (2)   The City must provide the person owning the tower three months
notice to be heard before the Planning Commission before initiating such
action. After such notice has been provided, the City shall have the authority
to initiate proceedings to either acquire the tower and any appurtenances
attached thereto at the then fair market value, or in the alternative, order
the demolition of the tower and all appurtenances.
      (3)   The City shall provide the tower owner with the right to a public
hearing and shall follow the three month notice required in the above mentioned
paragraph. All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard

Editor's note:
   This table lists those Ohio Revised Code sections which have been
substantially duplicated by corresponding Code of Ordinance sections. All
legislative history references to “(R.C. § xx.xx)” which appear at the end of
sections (or divisions of sections) in the City's Code of Ordinances have been
listed here. Example: to determine which section of the Code of Ordinances is
based on R.C. § 4511.19, scan down this table to the citation for “4511.19” and
examine the entry across from it: in this case, the corresponding Code of
Ordinances section is § 73.01, which means that § 73.01 (or a part thereof) is
based directly on R.C. § 4511.19.
