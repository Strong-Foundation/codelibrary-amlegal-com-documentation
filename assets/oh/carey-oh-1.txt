ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Carey, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF CAREY,
OHIO:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Carey, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Carey, Ohio, 1979.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk, attached to this Ordinance as a part hereof, and
filed with the permanent records of the Village of Carey, Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to August 19, 1979, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision
shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of
revision and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

(ORC 1.58)
   101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

105.08    Managing records.
   105.01 MISSION STATEMENT.
   Openness leads to a better informed citizenry, which leads to better
government and better public policy. It is the mission and intent of the
Village of Carey, Ohio (hereinafter Village) to at all times fully comply with
and abide by both the spirit and the letter of Ohio's Public Records Act. (Ord.
2019-29. Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.02  DEFINING PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   A "record" is defined to include the following: A document in any
format-paper, electronic (including, but not limited to, business e-mail)-that
is created, received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of the Village that
documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the office.
   (b)   A "public record" is a "record" that is being kept by this office at
the time a public records request is made, subject to applicable exemptions
from disclosure under Ohio or federal law. All public records must be organized
and maintained in such a way that they can be made available for inspection and
copying.
(Ord. 2019-29. Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.03 RESPONSE TIMEFRAME.
   (a)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours. Public records must be made available promptly. Copies of
public records must be made available within a reasonable period of time.
"Prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the volume of records requested,
the proximity of the location where the records are stored, the necessity for
any legal review and redaction, and other facts and circumstances of the
records requested.
   (b)   It is the goal of the Village that all requests for public records
should be acknowledged in writing or, if feasible, satisfied within three (3)
business days following the office's receipt of the request. (Ord. 2019-29.
Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.04 HANDLING REQUESTS.
   (a)   No specific language is required to make a request for public records.
However, the requester must at least identify the records requested with
sufficient clarity to allow the office to identify, retrieve, and review the
records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record(s). It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested. However, the law does permit the office to
ask for a written request, the requester's identity, and/or the intended use of
the information requested, but only if (1) a written request or disclosure of
identity or intended use would benefit the requester by enhancing the office's
ability to identify, locate, or deliver the public records that have been
requested; and (2) the requester is first told that a written request is not
required and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester's identity
or intended use.
 
   (c)   In processing the request, the office does not have an obligation to
create new records or perform a search or research for information in the
office's records. An electronic record is deemed to exist so long as a computer
is already programmed to produce the record through the office's standard use
of sorting, filtering, or querying features. Although not required by law, the
office should consider generating new records when it makes sense and is
practical under the circumstances.
   (d)   In processing a request for inspection of a public record, an office
employee may accompany the requester during inspection to make certain original
records are not taken or altered.
   (e)   A copy of the most recent edition of the Ohio Sunshine Laws Manual is
available via the Ohio Attorney General's website for the purpose of keeping
employees of the office and the public educated as to the office's obligation
under Ohio's Public Record's Act, Ohio's Open Meetings Act, records retention
laws, and the Personal Information Systems Act.
(Ord. 2019-29. Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.05  ELECTRONIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Records in the form of e-mail, text messaging, and instant messaging,
including those sent and received via hand-held communications device, are to
be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats, such as paper or
audiotape.
   (b)   Public record content transmitted to or from private accounts or
personal devices is subject to disclosure. All employees or representatives of
this office are required to retain their e-mail records and other electronic
records in accordance with applicable records retention schedules. (Ord. 2019-
29. Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.06 DENIAL AND REDACTION OF RECORDS.
   (a)   If the requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request such that the office cannot reasonably identify
what public records are being requested, the request may be denied, but the
office must then provide the requester an opportunity to revise the request by
informing the requester of the manner in which records are maintained and
accessed by the office.
   (b)   If the office withholds, redacts, or otherwise denies requested
records, it must provide an explanation, including legal authority, for the
denial(s). If the initial request was made in writing, the explanation must
also be in writing. If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt,
the exempt portions may be redacted and the rest must be released. When making
public records available for public inspection or copying, the office shall
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction plainly visible.
(Ord. 2019-29. Passed 12-16-19.)
   105.07  COPYING AND MAILING COSTS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records may be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, not labor. The charge for black and white paper copies is ten
cents ($0.10) per page. The charge for color paper copies is twenty cents
($0.20) per page. The charge for electronic files downloaded to a compact disc
or digital versatile disc is two dollars ($2.00) per disc. The charge for
photographic images is three dollars ($3.00).
   (b)   A requester may be required to pay in advance for the actual costs
involved in providing the copy. The requester may choose whether to have the
record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium on which the public record
is kept, or upon any other medium on which the office determines that the
record can reasonably be duplicated as an integral part of the office's normal
operations.
   (c)   If a requester asks that documents be delivered to them, he or she may
be charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies, or other cost
of delivery. There is no charge for e-mailed documents. (Ord. 2019-29. Passed
12-16-19.)
   105.08  MANAGING RECORDS.
   Village records are subject to records retention schedules. The office's
current schedules are available at 127 N. Vance Street, Carey, Ohio, a location
readily available to the public as required by Ohio Revised Code Section 149.43
(B)(2).

insurance payments to maintain the employee's coverage for a period of up to
three months following the month in which the employee last was in active pay
status. This insurance continuation is subject to the conditions set forth
below.

to return to work following a period of disability, an employee must be capable
of performing all of the essential functions of his or her job. Job
restructuring may be possible, however, where alternate methods of performing
the essential functions of the job exist.

insurance policy at the time of their application for short-term disability
leave, the Municipality will loan up to three months of continued health
insurance coverage. The employee is obligated to repay the Municipality for
fifty percent (50%) of its expenses incurred as a result of this loan after the
employee returns to work. Repayment may be made in incremental payments, in
accordance with terms established by the Administration.
      (2)    Long term disability leave. In the event that the employee's
physician estimates that the employee will be able to return to work and
perform the essential job functions of their job position no sooner than one
year, the employee shall be eligible to apply for "long term disability leave."
      In the case of employees who are covered by the Municipality's health
insurance policy at the time of their application for long-term disability
leave, the Municipality will loan up to three months of continued health
insurance coverage only if the employee first has applied to PERS or PFDPF,
whichever retirement system applies, for disability retirement. If the employee
receives a long-term disability retirement from PERS or PFDPF, the employee is
obligated to repay the Municipality for its expenses incurred as a result of
this loan.
   (e)    Disability Retirement. In the event that an employee has exhausted
all of his or her accrued sick leave and vacation leave and the employee's
physician anticipates that the employee will not be able to return to work for
a period in excess of one year, the employee shall apply to PERS or PFDPF,
whichever retirement system applies, seeking a disability retirement.
   (f)    Disqualification. An employee who is on disability leave may lose
that status and be subject to disciplinary sanctions in the event that the
employee has engaged in any falsification or dishonesty involving the
employee's incapacitated status, disability leave application, or physician's
documents. Employees who are on disability leave may not engage in employment
with another employer involving work having essential job functions of a type
similar to those the employee purportedly is unable to perform for the
Municipality by reason of physical or mental incapacity. The Municipality
reserves the examination by a physician selected by the Municipality. In the
event that the Municipality requires such an examination, the Municipality
shall pay the cost of the examination. In addition, the Municipality reserves
the right to require the employee to submit to nursing or other health follow-
up visits or examinations in order to verify continued disability.
   (g)    COBRA Coverage. Regardless of whether an employee seeks or is
eligible for disability leave, federal law provides that in certain situations,
an employee who is covered by the Municipality's health insurance policy has a
right to continue that coverage, at the employee's expense, for a period of
time after the employee terminates employment with the Municipality. For more
information regarding continuation of insurance coverage, please contact the
plan administrator for the health insurance policy.

entity, pass-through entity, profession or other unincorporated entity by the
Village or any other taxing municipality at the same or higher rate.
            1.   A resident individual who is sole owner of a nonresident
unincorporated entity shall pay the tax on the entire net profits of his
resident unincorporated business entity. If allocation to another municipality
exists, the taxpayer may qualify for credit for tax paid to another locality
under Section
171.14.
            2.   In the case of a resident individual partner or part owner of
a nonresident unincorporated entity, the tax is imposed on such individual's
distributive share of net profits not attributable to the Village, under
business apportionment percentage formula provided for in Section
171.03(b), and not taxed against the entity.
      (5)   Net Profits of Corporations. On the portion attributable to the
Village of the net profits earned by all corporations, whether domestic or
foreign, that are not pass-through entities derived from sales made, work done
or services performed or rendered or business or other activities conducted in

business in the Village.
         A.   The tax is imposed on the net profits attributable to the Village
under the business apportionment percentage formula provided for in this
chapter.

other activity in the Village, the provisions of the Rules and Regulations, if
any, of this chapter shall be applicable.

shall be considered a resident Village corporation and shall disregard the
business apportionment percentage formula and pay the tax on the entire net
profits of the corporate entity, unless allocation to another taxing
municipality exists.
         D.   Corporations which are required by the provisions of Ohio Revised
Code 5727.38 to 5727.41, inclusive, to pay an excise tax in any taxable year as
defined by the chapter, may exclude that part of their gross receipts upon
which the excise tax is paid. In such case, expenses incurred in the production
of such gross receipts shall not be deducted in computing net profits subject
to the tax imposed by the chapter.
      (6)   Amplification. In amplification of the definition contained in
Section
171.02 herein, but not in limitation thereof, the following additional
information respecting net business profits is furnished.
         A.   Net Profits.
            1.   “Net profit” for a taxpayer other than an individual means
adjusted federal taxable income and “net profit” for a taxpayer who is an
individual means the individual’s profit, other than amounts described in
Section
171.03(e), required to be reported on schedule C, schedule E, or schedule F.
            2.   “Adjusted federal taxable income” means a C corporation’s
federal taxable income before net operating losses and special deductions as
determined under the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as defined in Section
171.02 herein.
         B.   Gross Receipts.
            1.   Gross receipts shall include but not be limited to income in
the form of commissions, fees, directors’ fees, subpay, profit sharing from
nonqualified plans, rentals from real and tangible personal property, and other
compensation for work or services performed or rendered as well as income from
sales of stock in trade.
            2.   Gross receipts shall include ordinary income from Form 4797.
         C.   Expenses.
            1.   All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business,
including reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed but no
deduction may be claimed for salary or withdrawal of a proprietor or of the
partners, members, or other owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise.
            2.   If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere
in the return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction
for depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or
casualty, not compensated for by insurance or otherwise of property used in the
trade or business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the
purpose of the federal income tax. Provided, however, that loss on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of depreciable property or real estate, used in
the taxpayer's business, shall not be allowed as a deductible expense.
            3.   Current amortization of emergency facilities under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, if recognized as such for federal
income tax purposes, may be included as an expense deduction hereunder.
            4.   Where depreciable property is voluntarily destroyed, only the
cost of such demolition and the undepreciated balance thereof will be allowed
as an expense in the year of such demolition, to the extent allowable for
federal income tax purposes.
            5.   Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or at the discretion of the Tax
Commissioner (if the reserve method is used), a reasonable addition to the
reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the amount exceed the amount
allowable for federal income tax purposes.
            6.   Only taxes directly connected with the business may be claimed
as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not subject to
the tax, then taxes on and other expenses of said property are not deductible.
In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income: (1) the tax
under the chapter; (2) federal or other taxes based upon income; (3) gift,
estate or inheritance taxes; (4) taxes for local benefit or improvements to
property which tend to appreciate the value thereof; and (5) self-employment
taxes for unincorporated businesses or other entities, including credit for
employment taxes as allowed for federal tax purposes.
            7.   If the taxpayer reports income that is non-taxable under the
chapter and such amounts are deducted in order to reconcile the municipal
return with the taxpayer’s federal return, expenses attributable to this non-
taxable income shall not be allowed as a deduction from the remaining taxable
income. The expenses attributable to such non-taxable income shall be:
               a.   Five percent (5%) of the non-taxable income. Non- taxable
income given capital gain treatment on the federal return, from which
attributable expenses were already deducted, is not subject to the foregoing.
            8.   An employee who is paid on a commission or other compensation
basis and who pays his business expense from his commissions or other
compensation, without reimbursement from his employer, may deduct from his
gross commissions or other compensations, business expenses allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes but only to the extent
said expenses are incurred in earning commissions or other compensations
subject to the tax imposed by the chapter. Business expenses allowed shall be
those expenses allowed to be claimed on the federal Form 2106 and upon the
request of the Tax Commissioner, verifiable with supporting schedules and/or
receipts. Failure to produce the supporting schedules and/or receipts upon
request of the Tax Commissioner shall result in disallowance of the expenses in
question. No expenses claimed on federal Form Schedule A, Itemized Deductions
shall be allowed.
            9.   Income from the sale of, or lease of mineral rights are not
taxable and expenses or loss in connection therewith are not deductible for tax
purposes except in cases where taxpayer conducts the activities by which the
minerals are extracted from the land.
            10.   Funds allocated by employers to qualified plans of employees
are not taxable to the employees if the employees have no vested right in the
money so allocated.
            11.   401(k), IRA, SEP, KEOGH plans or any other type of deferred
compensation plans shall not be allowed as a deduction against income for
unincorporated entities or the like as allowed for federal purposes.
            12.   Deductions shall not be allowed for self-employed health
insurance against income as allowed for federal or state tax purposes for
unincorporated entities or the like.
            13.   Expenses incurred while attending educational courses may not
be deducted from wages.
            14.   Moving expenses included in gross earnings shall be an
allowance as a deductible expense. No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer
does not provide the federal Form 3903 for his moving deductions. Only moving
expenses incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings, will be
allowed.
            15.   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent
allowed as such for the purpose of determining federal income tax will be
recognized and allowed for determining Village income tax under the provisions
of this chapter. However, contributions are not considered as an ordinary and
necessary expense of doing business and are disallowed as an expense.
      (7)   Rentals From Real Property.
         A.   The rental of real estate is ordinarily a business activity, and
the income from such rentals are taxable, provided, however, where the
taxpayer's entire rental activity produces gross rentals of less than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, it will be prima facie evidence that
such rental activities are not a business activity. If gross rentals equal or
exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month, the entire net income
from rentals is taxable. In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of
any real property, periods during which, by reason of vacancy or any other
cause, rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the
taxpayer.
         B.   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
         C.   Real property shall include commercial property, residential
property, farm property, and any and all types of real estate.
         D.   In determining the taxable income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Service for federal income tax purposes.
         E.   Residents of the Village are subject to taxation upon the net
income from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the location
of the real property owned. However, if any such property is located outside
the Village, and is subject to another municipal income tax, credit shall be
claimed in accordance with Section
171.14.
         F.   Nonresidents of the Village are subject to such taxation only if
the real property is situated within the Village.
         G.   To be considered non-taxable as ground rents, the property must
be under perpetual leasehold by the terms of which the lessor performs no
services of any type, including the payment of taxes on the property.
         H.   Businesses owning or managing real estate are taxed only on that
portion of income derived from property located in the Village.
      (8)   Royalties. Income in the form of royalties is taxable if taxpayer's
activities produced the publication or other product, the sale of which
produces the royalties.
      (9)   Gambling Winnings. On all income received as gambling winnings as
reported on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G, Form 5754 and/or any other form
required by the Internal Revenue Service that reports winnings from gambling.

games, horse racing, dog racing, jai alai, sweepstakes, wagering pools,
lotteries, prizes and any other wagering transactions.
      (10)   Non-employee compensation.
      (11)   Fellowships, scholarships, stipends and grants, to the extent that
they are taxable for federal income tax purposes.
   (b)   Apportionment of Business Profits for Businesses Both In and Outside
the Village Boundaries. This section does not apply to taxpayers that are
subject to and required to file reports under Chapter 5745, of the Ohio Revised
Code. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) hereof, net profit from a
business or profession conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   Business Apportionment Percentage Formula. Multiply the entire net
profits of the business by a business apportionment percentage formula to be
determined by:
         A.   STEP 1. Ascertain the percentage which the average original cost
of the real and tangible personal property, including leasehold improvements,
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession and situated within
the Village during the taxable period is to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            1.   As used in the preceding subsection, real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight
(8). The percentage of taxpayer's real and tangible personal property within
the Village is determined by dividing the average original cost of such
property within the Village (without deduction of any encumbrances) by the
average original cost of all such property within and without the Village.
            2.   Gross rents means the actual sum of money or other
consideration payable, directly or indirectly, by the taxpayer for the use or
possession of property and includes:
               a.   Any amount payable for the use or possession of real and
tangible personal property or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed
sum of money or as a percentage of sales profits or otherwise;
               b.   Any amount payable as additional rent or in lieu of rent
such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, or other amounts required to be
paid by the terms of a lease or other arrangement.
               c.   A residence may not be considered an office unless a
portion thereof is used exclusively for business purposes and is reached by a
separate entrance in an exterior wall which does not serve as the entrance to
the balance of the building.
         B.   STEP 2. Ascertain the percentage which the total wages, salaries,
including sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments,
settlements, stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an
employee buyout or wage continuation plan and other forms of compensation paid
during the taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Village is to the total wages, salaries, including
sick and vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements,
stock options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee
buyout or wage continuation plan and other forms of compensation paid during
the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever
their services are performed, excluding compensation that is not taxable by the
municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
            1.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the Village income tax paid owners
or credited to the account of owners or partners during the period covered by
the return are considered wages for the purpose of this computation.
            2.   Salaries, wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
and other forms of compensation subject to the Village income tax shall be
computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of
accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
            3.   In the case of an employee who performs services both within
and without the Village the amount treated as compensation for services
performed within the Village shall be deemed to be:
               a.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to
his efforts within the Village.
               b.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on
other results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation received which
the value of his services, within the Village bears to the value of all his
services; and
               c.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which his working time within
the Village is of his total working time.
               d.   Provided, however, all employees regularly connected with
or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in the Village
who perform seventy-five percent (75%) or more of their services within the
Village be considered employees within the Village.
            4.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of days
spent within the Village to total working days. All employees regularly
connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the
taxpayer outside the Village who perform twenty-five percent (25%) or less of
their services within the Village shall be considered employees outside the
Village. (The provisions of this subsection are not applicable in determining
the tax liability of a nonresident who works in and outside the Village.)
         C.   STEP 3. Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of the
business or profession from sales made and services performed during the
taxable period in the Village is to gross receipts of the business or
profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever made or
performed.
            1.   The following sales shall be considered Village sales:
               a.   All sales made through retail stores located within the
Village to purchasers within or without the Village except such of said sales
to purchasers outside the Village that are directly attributable to regular
solicitations made outside the Village personally by taxpayer's employees.
               b.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods at an office, store, warehouse, factory, or
place of storage located within the Village.
               c.   All sales of tangible personal property delivered to
purchasers within the Village regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside the Village if the Taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the Village and the sales directly or indirectly result from such
solicitation or promotion.
               d.   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from an
office, store, warehouse, factory or place of storage within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place of delivery.
               e.   Charges for work done or services performed incident to a
sale, whether or not included in the price of the property shall be considered
gross receipts from such sale.
               f.   In the application of the foregoing subsections a carrier
shall be considered the agent of the seller, regardless of the FOB point or
other conditions of the sale, and the place at which orders are accepted or
contracts legally consummated shall be immaterial. Solicitation of customers
outside the Village by mail or phone from an office, or place of business
within the Village shall not be considered a solicitation of sales outside the
Village.
               g.   Nonresident professional persons shall use the factor of
the Village billings over total billings.
         D.   STEP 4. Adding together the percentages determined in accordance
with Section
171.03(b)(1)A., B. and C. herein or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving such total. The result so obtained
is the business apportionment percentage.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the Village. A factor is excluded only when it does not
exist anywhere.
            2.   Provided, however, that in the event a just and equitable
result cannot be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula
provided for herein, the Tax Commissioner, upon application of the taxpayer,
shall have the authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to
effect a fair and proper apportionment.
         E.   STEP 5. The business apportionment percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits apportioned to the Village.
      (2)   Substitute Method.
         A.   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under
the business apportionment percentage formula, the Tax Commissioner, upon
application of the taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other
factors in the business apportionment percentage formula or prescribe other
methods of apportioning net income calculated to effect a fair and proper
apportionment.
         B.   Application to the Tax Commissioner to substitute other factors
in the business apportionment percentage formula or to use a different method
to apportion net profits must be made in writing before the end of the tax year
and shall state the specific grounds on which the substitution of factors or
use of a different method is requested and the relief sought to be obtained. A
copy thereof shall be served at the time of filing upon the taxpayer or Tax
Commissioner as the case may be. No specific form need be followed in making
such application. Once a taxpayer has filed under a substitute method, he must
continue to so file until given permission to change by the Tax Commissioner.
         C.   The decision of the Tax Commissioner on subsections (b)(2)A. and
(b)(2)B. hereof may be appealed by the taxpayer to the Board of Review, which
shall have the power to affirm, reverse or modify such decision of the Tax
Commissioner.
      (3)   Professional And Personal Service. In the case of professional
people and others furnishing personal services, if their only place of business
is within the Village all their net profits shall prima facie be attributable
to the Village.
   
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) hereof, net profit from
rental activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to
tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net
profit is located.
   (d)   This section does not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Municipality and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Municipality may impose a tax on all income earned by

are affiliated through stock ownership if that affiliated group filed for the
same tax period a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes pursuant

include all companies that are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year,
consolidated returns shall continue to be filed in subsequent years unless:
A.   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Commissioner to file separate
returns.
         B.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.

a deductible expense. No deduction will be allowed if the taxpayer does not
provide the federal Form 3903 for his moving deductions. Only moving expenses
incurred, as part of income included in gross earnings, will be allowed.
      (7)   Except as provided for herein, the tax is on the association,
unincorporated business, pass-through entity, profession or other
unincorporated entity as an entity whether resident or nonresident and a return
is required disclosing the net profits apportioned to the Village and the tax
paid thereon. However, any resident partner or resident member is required to
make a return and pay the tax in accordance with this chapter and Rules and
Regulations.
      (8)   Any taxpayer who received taxable income not subject to withholding
under this chapter must file a return.
      (9)   Any taxpayer having income, wages, or other compensation for which
a return must be filed, and also having net profits from a business is required
to file only one return.
      (10)   Executors, administrators and trustees are required to file
returns on the trusts, are liable for the payment of any taxes due by a
deceased from an estate of such deceased and are required to give the name and
address of the beneficiaries, even though the latter individually pays the tax.
   (b)   Joint Returns.
      (1)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint
return for Village purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Village return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
Village return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable
income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
      (2)   A husband and wife may file a joint return either when engaged in
the same or separate businesses, but may not deduct business losses of either
from compensation paid by an employer.
   (c)   Returns, Information Required and Reconciliation with Federal Returns.
The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Commissioner, or an
acceptable generic form that contains all of the information required to be
submitted with the Village’s prescribed form setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan, other compensation earned, received, apportioned or set
aside from each employer, gambling winnings, and the net profits from any
business, profession or other activity, including the rental from use of real
and personal property, distributive shares from pass-through entities and other
income defined by statute as taxable, received for the period covered by the
return and such other pertinent facts and information in detail as the Tax
Commissioner may require.
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules or other information as the Tax
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after notification by the Tax Commissioner, or his authorized representative,
to file the items required by this paragraph.
      (5)   The Tax Commissioner shall accept a generic form of any return,
report, or document required to be filed if the generic form once completed and
filed contains all of the information required to be submitted with the
Village’s prescribed returns, reports or documents, and if the taxpayer or
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with this chapter
and Rules and Regulations governing the filing of returns, reports or
documents.
      (6)   Where figures of total income, deductions, and net profits are
included, as shown by a federal return, any items of income that are not
subject to the Village tax and unallowable expenses shall be eliminated in
determining net income subject to the Village tax. The fact that any taxpayer
is not required to file a federal tax return does not relieve him from filing a
Village tax return.
      (7)   If a change in federal income tax liability, made by the Internal
Revenue Service, or by a judicial decision, results in an additional amount of
tax payable to the Village, a report of such change shall be filed by the
taxpayer within three (3) months after receipt of the final notice from the
Internal Revenue Service or final court decision.
      (8)   If a change in federal income tax liability results in a reduction
of taxes owed and paid to the Village, a claim for refund shall be filed with
the Tax Commissioner as prescribed in Section
171.11.
   (d)   Extensions.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the Village’s tax
return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s
request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing the Village’s tax return in writing.
      (3)   The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the Village’s tax return as prescribed by this chapter and Rules
and Regulations.
      (4)   A valid extension request extends the due date for filing a return
to the last day of the month following the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.
      (5)   The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes the Village any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax;
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (6)   The granting of an extension for filing a Village income tax return
does not extend the due date for paying of the tax; hence, penalty and interest
may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of extension at the rate set out
by Section
171.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements of the Village Tax Code have been met. Any
extension by the Tax Commissioner shall be granted with the understanding that
declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if,
upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and
payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be
assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
      (7)   Information returns, schedules and statements needed to support tax
returns are to be filed within the time limits set forth for filing the tax
returns.
   (e)   Payment with Returns.
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon.
However, where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at the
source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.06, where any portion of such tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer,
pursuant to the provisions of Section
171.07, or where an income tax, creditable against the Village tax pursuant to
Section
171.14 has been paid to another taxing municipality, credit for the amount so
paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return.
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
171.11(b), a taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election
indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded,
provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (f)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Commissioner or upon an acceptable generic form that contains all of the
information required to be submitted with the Village’s prescribed form. A
taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or apportionment of net
profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Village tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
         (Ord. 2004-18. Passed 9-20-04.)
   171.06 COLLECTION OF TAX AT THE SOURCE.
   (a)   Duty of Withholding and Payment of Tax Withheld by Employer.
      (1)   It is the duty of each employer within, or doing business within
the Village, who employs one or more persons, whether as an employee, officer,
director or otherwise, on a salary, wage, commission or other personal service
compensation basis to deduct, each time any such compensation is paid,
allocated or set aside to an employee the tax at the rate provided in Section
171.03 hereof on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay,
bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance
pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation
plan or other compensation due by such employer to each such employee and
shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes
so deducted. However, the Tax Commissioner shall have the authority to grant to
employers with three or less resident employees permission for said employees
to file individually. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Tax Commissioner and shall be subject to the Rules and
Regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Nothing in this section
prohibits an employer from withholding tax on a basis greater than qualifying
wages. The tax shall be deducted by the employer from:
         A.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the Village
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to residents of the Village, regardless
of the place where services are rendered; and
         B.   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, including sick and
vacation pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock
options, grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or
wage continuation plan or other forms of compensation subject to the Village
income tax paid, allocated or set aside to nonresidents for work done or
service performed or rendered in the Village or as a result of employment in
the Village or other activities engaged in within the Village.
         C.   An employer is liable for the payment of the tax required to be
deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
      (2)   All employers within or doing business within the Village are
required to make the collections and deductions specified, regardless of the
fact that the services on account of which any particular deduction is
required, as to residents of the Village, were performed outside the Village.
      (3)   Employers who do not maintain a permanent office or place of
business in the Village, but who are subject to tax on net profits attributable
to the Village, under the method of allocation provided for in this chapter,
are considered to be employers within the Village and subject to the
requirements of withholding.
      (4)   Commissions and fees paid to professionals, brokers and others who
are independent contractors, and not employees of the payer, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file a declaration and return and pay the tax pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter and Rules and Regulations.
      (5)   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services
rendered or performed partly within and partly without the Village, the
withholding employer shall deduct, withhold and remit the tax on that portion
of the compensation which is earned within the Village in accordance with the
following rules of apportionment:
         A.   If an employer is located within the Village, all non-resident
employees who report to the Village location are taxable to the Village unless
the employer is withholding tax for other taxing municipalities where the
employee’s work is performed.
         B.   If the nonresident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation depends directly on the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the portion of
the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted or chiefly
effected by the employee within the Village bears to the total volume of
business transacted by him within and outside the Village.
         C.   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
other nonresident employees, including officers of corporations shall attach to
the proportion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the
total number of his working hours within the Village is of the total number of
working hours.
         D.   The fact that nonresident employees are subject to call at any
time does not permit the apportionment of pay for time worked within the
Village on a seven-day per week basis. The percentage of time worked in the
Village will be computed on the basis of a forty-hour week unless the employer
notifies the Tax Commissioner that a greater or lesser number of hours per week
is worked.
            1.   The determination of tax liability of nonresidents working in
and out of the corporate limits is to be computed on the formula of the total
number of days worked in the Village divided by the total number of days worked
during the year and the resulting percentage applied to the total annual income
from qualifying wages including sick leave, holiday pay, vacation pay and other
wage continuation plans during periods of disability, sickness or absence from
work. Where no record can be substantiated of the number of days worked, the
figure 260 is to be used as the total number of days worked.
         E.   Wages of occasional entrants as defined in Section
171.03(a)(2)C. are not subject to withholding.
         F.   Wage continuation plans paid by the employer or third party agent
on behalf of the employer for the purpose of health, rest, recuperation or
other reward are deemed to have the same tax situs as the primary job
assignment or job location of the employee and are taxable on the same ratio as
the normal earnings of such employee for this primary job assignment.
      (6)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any
advances made to an employee on account of commissions.
      (7)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid to the employee for expenses necessarily and
actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of his services,
provided such expenses are incurred in earning compensation, including
commissions, and are not deducted as a business expense by the employee.
      (8)   An employer whose records show that an employee is a nonresident of
the Village and has no knowledge to the contrary shall be relieved of the
responsibility of withholding the tax on personal service compensation paid to
such employee for services rendered or work done outside the Village by such
employee, provided, however, that such employer must withhold the tax on all
personal service compensation paid such employee after the Tax Commissioner
notifies said employer in writing that such employee is a resident of the
Village. All employees are required to notify the employer of any change of
residence and the date thereof.
      (9)   An employer shall not be required to withhold the Village tax from
the qualifying wages earned by a resident of the Village for work done or
services performed in another taxing municipality which imposes a tax upon such
qualifying wages of such Village resident if such employer withholds the tax on
such resident's wages or other compensation for such other taxing municipality.
Except, where such municipal tax is for a smaller amount than the tax imposed
by this chapter, the employer shall withhold and remit the difference to the
Village.
      (10)   The Tax Commissioner shall have authority to enter into agreement
with other taxing municipalities permitting an employer to withhold the entire
tax on the qualifying wages, including sick and vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options, grievance pay,
severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage continuation plan
or other forms of compensation subject to the Village income tax of a floater
either for the taxing municipality in which the employer has his principal
place of business or the taxing municipality in which the employee resides.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Compensation deferred before the effective date of this amendment is
not subject to any municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax
withholding requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not
constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
   (e)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Village during
the measurement period are less than three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month,
payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month following
the end of the quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax Commissioner. The
Tax Commissioner may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments
whenever the Tax Commissioner has reason to believe that the conditions for
granting such authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not
met, or when it is in the best interest of the Village to do so. Notice of
withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in such case, the employer must begin
to file in accordance with this section.
   (f)   Employer Considered as Trustee.
      (1)   Each employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the
same, until payment is made by such employer to the Village, as a trustee for
the benefit of the Village, and any such tax collected by such employer from
his employees shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust
fund in the hands of such employer.
      (2)   Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax in fact has been withheld.
   (g)   Personal Liability for Collection and Payment of Tax. Any person who
is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages, including sick and vacation
pay, bonuses, commissions, incentive payments, settlements, stock options,
grievance pay, severance pay, any pay as part of an employee buyout or wage
continuation plan or other compensation, shall pay all such tax to the Village
in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the Village in
accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the Village as
well as any related interest and penalties, and are also criminally liable
under the provisions of Section
171.12. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited
liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s, member’s,
manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (h)   Withholding Return; List of Employees.
      (1)   Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation form
showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of
which, if any, was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for
same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the
amount of such withholdings remitted. Such return shall include Form W-2 for
each employee or a list of employees containing W-2 information concerning each
employee from whom the Village tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip
code and social security number of each such employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of Village tax withheld. If
the total tax withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to
another taxing municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on
the return of information to the Village concerning each employee. The
withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before
February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
      (2)   If more than the amount of tax required to be deducted by this
chapter is withheld from the employee's pay, the excess shall be refunded by
the employer to the employee. If less than the amount of tax required to be
deducted is deducted and withheld by the employer in any pay period or pay
periods, the deficiency shall be deducted in subsequent pay periods.
      (3)   When an employer has withheld the tax from all wages of a
nonresident of the Village and such nonresident has been employed outside the
Village for all or a part of the time and has been withheld for or has paid
taxes due another municipality as a result of that employment, such employee
shall file a claim with the Tax Commissioner covering such erroneous
withholding and the Tax Commissioner shall, upon verification thereof by the
employer, refund to the employee the amount of such withholding paid to another
municipality, subject to the requirements and limitations contained in Sections
171.11 and
171.14.
   (i)    Form 1099 Reporting. In addition to the wage reporting of this
section, any person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form
1099-Misc. payments to individuals not treated as employees for services
performed shall also report such payment to the Village when the services were
performed in the Village. The information may be submitted on a listing, and
shall include the name, address and social security number (or federal
identification number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s)
1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed
annually on or before February 28.
   (j)   Domestic Servants. However, no person shall be required to withhold
the tax on the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other
taxable income paid to domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such
person’s residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for
filing and paying their own returns and taxes.
   (k)   Fractional Parts Of Cents. In deducting and withholding tax at the
source and in payment of any tax due under this chapter, a fractional part of a
cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent (.005) or more in
which case it shall be increased to one cent (.01).
(Ord. 2004-18. Passed 9-20-04.)
   171.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement for Filing.
      (1)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not or
will not be withheld by an employer or employers subject to Section
171.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
subject to the tax imposed by Section
171.03, shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. Provided, however, if a person’s income is
wholly from qualifying wages from which the tax will be withheld and remitted
to this Village in accordance with Sections
171.03,
171.06 and
171.14, such person need not file a declaration.
      (2)   A taxpayer’s final return for the preceding year may be used as the
basis for computing his declaration of estimated tax for the current year. In
the event a taxpayer has not previously been required to file a return, a
declaration of estimated tax on anticipated income shall be filed in good
faith.
   (b)   Dates for Filing.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15th of each
year during the effective period of this chapter, or on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the date the taxpayer first
becomes subject to the provisions of this section.
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Forms: Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Taxing Municipality.
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner, or upon an acceptable generic form that
contains all of the information required to be submitted with the Village’s
prescribed form. Credit shall be taken in such declaration for Village tax to
be withheld from any portion of such income and for income taxes to be paid to
another taxing municipality for which credit is allowed against Village tax
under Section
171.14.
      (2)   For taxpayers who are individuals, such declaration of estimated
tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of at least
twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability for the
current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the last
day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th) and thirteenth (13th) months after the
beginning of the taxable year.
      (3)   For taxpayers that are not individuals, such declaration of
estimated tax to be paid the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment of
at least twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of the estimated tax liability
for the current year and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before
the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth (6th), ninth (9th) and twelfth (12th)
months after the beginning of the taxable year.
      (4)   The mere submission of a declaration estimating a tax liability
shall not constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.
   (d)   Amended Declaration.
      (1)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon
shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before the last day of
the month following the close of the taxpayer’s tax year, if it appears that
the original declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s
income by ten percent (10%) or more. At such time a payment, which together
with prior payments, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’s entire estimated
liability, shall be made. If, upon the filing of the return required it appears
that the taxpayer did not pay ninety percent (90%) of his tax liability, as
shown on such return, on or before the last day of the month following the
close of the tax year, the difference between ninety percent (90%) of such
taxpayer’s tax liability and the amount of estimated tax he actually paid on or
before such date shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of
Section
171.10.
      (3)   In the event an amended declaration has been filed the unpaid
balance shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments over the
remaining payment dates.
   (e)   Annual Return Required. On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth (4th) month following the end of the calendar or fiscal year an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the Village shall be
paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
171.05.
(Ord. 2004-18. Passed 9-20-04.)
   171.08 DUTIES OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein, to
keep an accurate record thereof and to report all monies so received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to enforce payment of
all income taxes owing the Village, to keep accurate records for a minimum of
six (6) years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a
declaration and/or make any return, including a return of taxes withheld, and
to show the dates and amounts of payments thereof.
(b)   Enforcement Provisions.
      (1)   Such Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, including the interpretation and enforcement of the
Rules and Regulations, if any, and is hereby empowered to enforce this chapter
and the Rules and Regulations, if any, authorized or required by this chapter,
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection and payment of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns.
      (2)   Any taxpayer or employer desiring a special ruling on any matter
pertaining to this chapter and Rules and Regulations should submit to the Tax
Commissioner in writing all the facts pertinent to the matter on which the
ruling is sought.
      (3)   This chapter and Rules and Regulations, if any, together with all
amendments and supplements hereto and all changes herein, will be on file at
the office of the Tax Commissioner and will be open to public inspection.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Commissioner that, due to certain
hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until the proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
      (5)   Failure to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total
unpaid amount, including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and
the provisions of Sections
171.11 and
171.12 shall apply.
   (c)   Estimation of Tax by the Tax Commissioner.
      (1)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has
filed a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Commissioner may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Village
from the taxpayer, may assess the taxpayer upon the basis of such determination
and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so
determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
      (2)   Such determination of tax may be adjusted upon submission by the
taxpayer of actual records from which his tax may be computed.
   (d)   Upon the demonstration and documentation of good cause, the Tax
Commissioner shall have the power to compromise penalty and interest

   171.10 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed and monies withheld or required to be withheld by

penalties for failure to pay taxes and to withhold and remit taxes pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter are hereby imposed as follows:

         (Ord. 2004-18. Passed 9-20-04.)
   171.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   Unpaid Sums – A Civil Debt.
      (1)   All taxes imposed by this chapter and not paid when due shall be
collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by suit as other
debts of like amount are recoverable. Employers who are required, under Section
171.06, to withhold or remit the taxes required to be withheld at the source
and who fail to withhold or remit, become liable to the Village in a civil
action to enforce the payment of the debt created by such failure.
      (2)   No additional assessment shall be made by the Tax Commissioner
after three (3) years from the time the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later. Provided, however, there shall be no period of limitation
on an additional assessment in a case of a return that omits gross income in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of that required to be reported or in the
case of filing a false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in
the case of failure to file a return.
      (3)   In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Service and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of
limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Tax Commissioner shall be extended one (1) year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Refunds and Overpayments.
      (1)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for
refund is made within three (3) years from the date on which such payment was
made or the return was due, or within three (3) months after final
determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later.
      (2)   No refund shall be made to any taxpayer until he has complied with
all provisions of this chapter and has furnished all information required by
the Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Overpayments will be either refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current liability at his option. Where the taxpayer has made no election,
overpayments of any year's taxes shall be applied as follows:
         A.   To taxes owed for any previous years in the order in which such
taxes become due.
         B.   To current estimated tax liability.
   (c)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Village income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment, except that
if any overpayment is refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing
date of the annual return or ninety (90) days after the complete return is
filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refunded
overpayment. For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments,
no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid
before the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to
any extension of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the
rate of interest prescribed by Ohio Revised Code 5703.47.
   (d)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.
(Ord. 2004-18. Passed 9-20-04.)

interest on Village income taxes shall be brought within three (3) years after

      (2)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter
shall be commenced within three (3) years after the commission of the offense,
provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission
of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income required to be reported,
prosecutions may be commenced within six (6) years after the commission of the
offense.
   (c)   The failure of any employer, taxpayer or person to receive or procure
a return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making
any information return, return or declaration, from filing such form, or from
paying the tax.
   (d)   “Person” as used in this section shall, in addition to the meaning
prescribed in Section
171.02, include in the case of an association or corporation not having any

this section shall adopt rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record
of its transactions. Such records are not public records available for
inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. Hearings requested by
a taxpayer before the Board of Review are not meetings of a public body subject
to Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code. The provisions of Section
171.09, with reference to the confidential character of information required to
be disclosed by this section, shall apply to such matters as may be heard

the decision should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within

tax or withholding the second municipality claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipal
corporation with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the tax rate in the second municipal corporation is less than the
tax rate in the first municipal corporation, then the credit described in
subsection (a) hereof shall be calculated using the tax rate in effect in the

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (13)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld MAY make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200). Payment under division (13)(1)(b) of this section shall
be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than
fifteen days after the last day of each month.
 
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
172.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (13)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
          (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
172.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (13)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
 172.051 of this Chapter.

         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
172.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;

         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
172.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

172.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax

taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.

resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (17)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,

   172.0621 ALTERNATIVE NET PROFITS APPORTIONMENT FOR REMOTE EMPLOYEES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is an
employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
         A.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
         B.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services for
the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
      (2)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
         "Qualifying remote work location may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
      (3)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
         A.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
         B.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer or
client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under section 718.03 of the Revised Code on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
      (4)   "Qualifying reporting location means one of the following:
         A.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
         B.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee or
owner under division (A)(4)(a) of this section, the reporting location in this
state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or periodically
reports during the taxable year;
         C.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee or
owner under division (A)(4)(a) or (b) of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
   (B)    A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this section to the
apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers
that make this election, the provisions of section 718.02 of the Revised Code
apply to such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this section. A
taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this section in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election. The
taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this section the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location. After the taxpayer
makes the initial election, the election applies to every municipal corporation
in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer shall not be required to
file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely because a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located in such municipal corporation. Nothing in this section prohibits a
taxpayer from making a new election under this section after properly revoking
a prior election.
   (C)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (A)
of section 718.02 of the Revised Code, all of the following apply to a taxpayer
that has made the election described in division (B) of this section:
      (1)    For the purpose of division (A)(l) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, the average original cost of any tangible personal property used
by a qualifying remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote
work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
      (2)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (3)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of section 718.02 of the
Revised Code, and notwithstanding division (D) of that section, any gross
receipts of the business or profession from services performed during the
taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed
at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
   (D)    Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a tax
administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or a
portion of the income of the taxpayer an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)
of section 718.02 of the Revised Code. However, a tax administrator shall not
require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
   (E)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section
is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages pursuant to
sections 718.011
and 718.03 of the Revised Code. (Ord. 2023-20. Passed 12-18-23.)

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
172.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
172.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's
qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 2015-21. Passed 11-30-15.)
 
172.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
172.081 of this Chapter. (Ord. 2015-21. Passed 11-30-15.)
172.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
172.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
172.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
172.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
2015-21. Passed 11-30-15.)
172.09 ANNUAL RETURN.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of each nonresident
individual taxpayer a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under division

The final return must be accompanied by the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040
or its equivalent or, in the event the individual is not required to file an
income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service, a signed affidavit
declaring the sources of income and stating the resident no longer expects to

         (b)   In the event the resident individual subsequently earns or

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact

   (E)   This Municipality shall not deny spouses the ability to file a joint

provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality.
       (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
172.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section 172.092 of this Chapter, the
provision in Section
172.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under divisions (F)(3) and (F)(4) of
this section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or division (B)(1)(c) of Section
172.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
172.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
172.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year. The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.
The affidavit also shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the
circumstances described in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in
activity which results in work being performed, services provided, sales made,
or other activity that results in municipal taxable income reportable to the
Municipality in the taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the
taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the
reporting and filing of municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income
tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for
the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian

Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this

172.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 2015-21. Passed 11-30-15.)
172.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's income tax return. If the request is received by the tax
administrator on or before the date the tax return is due, the tax
administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.

income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state

172.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)

taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
 172.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
172.10 of this Chapter.

provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 2015-21. Passed
11-30-15.)
172.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
172.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
172.15 of this Chapter and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,

      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.

   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall servean assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-21. Passed 11-30-15.)
172.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.

Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and

registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)    For the purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any
unlicensed motor vehicle, or any motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio
R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) as follows: a motor vehicle that is left uncovered in
the open on private property for more than seventy-two (72) hours with the
permission of the person having the right to the possession of the property;
that is three (3) years old or older; that is extensively damaged, such damage
including but not limited to missing wheels, tires, motor, or transmission;
that is apparently inoperable; and that has a fair market value of $1,500.00 or
less. Portions of junk cars, such as hood, fenders, radiators, rims, motors and
the like, not being utilized for the repair of a motor vehicle shall be
considered junk.
   An “unlicensed motor vehicle” means a motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C.
4501.01, including passenger automobiles, trucks, automotive reconversion
units, trailers or motorcycles, which do not display a current and valid
license plate with current sticker attached to the vehicle as required by Ohio
R.C. 4503.21.
   Exceptions include a person who is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or a person who is regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the
property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or
regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to
the possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of
a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector’s
vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector’s vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to possession of the property; except that such person
having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector’s
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten (10) days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
(30) days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense.
   (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates
this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of
this section, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of this section, whoever violates this section

         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.

of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Village.
      (4)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade,

   313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.

(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any

the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not

monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a probationary driver’s license with the
written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve
as the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section,

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver’s license, the court with jurisdiction
over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months

under subsection (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
subsection (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or

summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a

required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.

impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has
safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any
recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

violation. (Ord. 2016-17. Passed 9-19-16.)
355.03  PARKING VIOLATIONS BUREAU.
   (a)    The Village of Carey Parking Violations Bureau is hereby established
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.04. The Parking Violations Bureau shall be located
within the Carey Police Department. The Parking Violations Bureau has
jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the territory of
the Village of Carey. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, each parking infraction that occurs within the jurisdiction of the
Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of each such parking infraction
shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)    The operating costs of the Parking Violations Bureau shall be paid by
the Village of Carey, Ohio. The Service Committee shall appoint the Violations
Clerk, necessary clerical employees and hearing examiners. No person shall be
employed as a hearing examiner unless such person is an attorney admitted to
the practice of law in the State of Ohio.
   (c)    The fines, penalties, fees, and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained, and disbursed by the Violations Clerk
if the parking infraction out of which the fine, penalties, fees, and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau. The
Violations Clerk shall provide tickets for parking infractions to law
enforcement officers in the Police Department upon requisition of the Chief of
Police and shall also provide tickets for parking infractions upon requisition
of any other department or division which has employees whose duties include
the issuance of parking infraction tickets. Any person requisitioning tickets
shall account to the Violations Clerk for all tickets requisitioned at such
times as the Violations Clerk shall request. The fine, penalties, fees, and
costs collected by the Violations Clerk for a parking infraction shall be
disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the Village of Carey.
   (d)    The Mayor of the Village of Carey shall have authority to contract
with any non-governmental entity to provide services in processing, collecting,
and enforcing parking tickets issued by law enforcement officers and civil
judgments and default civil judgments entered pursuant to this chapter. No
contract shall affect the responsibilities of hearing examiners as prescribed
in this chapter, or the ultimate responsibility of the Violations Clerk to
collect, retain, and disburse fines, penalties, fees, and costs for parking
infractions and monies paid in satisfaction of judgments and default judgments
entered pursuant to this chapter.
   All contracts entered into by the Mayor pursuant to this Section shall be
authorized by Village Council. (Ord. 2016-17. Passed 9-19-16.)
 355.04  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE, AND LIABILITY.
   (a)    The parking ticket adopted in Section
355.10 hereof shall be used by law enforcement officers in all cases in which a
person is charged with committing a parking infraction within the Village of
Carey. The parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of
this chapter.
   (b)    A law enforcement officer who issues a parking ticket for a parking
infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the parking infraction
charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make or model of the
vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the parking infraction
charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and
file a copy with the Violations Clerk. If the operator of the vehicle is
present, the officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator
in a space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then
shall personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of
the vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word "owner" in the
space provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Constructive service
of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by affixation as provided in
this Division, or by the procedure described in Division (d) of this Section,
has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects both the owner and the
operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and costs for
failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as if the
parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)    The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this Section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the Village of Carey and of the law enforcement agency whose
officer issued it, and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)    An operator of a vehicle, who is not the owner of the vehicle, but
who operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner, is the
agent of the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in
accordance with this Section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the
operator in accordance with this Section constitutes constructive service upon
the owner for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased
vehicle, whose act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction, shall
not be considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business
of renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
355.09 hereof.
   (e)    Except as provided in Section
355.09 hereof, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is
served pursuant to this Section, the operator of the vehicle, whose act or
omission resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued,
and the owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different,
are jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees, and
costs arising out of the parking infraction. Any owner of a vehicle, who pays
any fine, penalty, fees, and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to
this chapter, may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle,
whose
act or omission resulted in the parking infraction. (Ohio R.C. 4521.03).
(Ord. 2016-17. Passed 9-19-16.)
355.05  ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)    A person, who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, may answer the charge
by appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail. An
answer shall be made within ten (10) days from the date of the infraction and
shall be in one of the following forms:
      (1)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)    An admission that the person committed the parking infraction,
with an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)    A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request    for a hearing relative to the infraction. If the person desires the
presence at the hearing of the law enforcement officer, who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction,
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    A person, who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation, shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction. The evidence may
be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance, may
be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail. The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
   If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates
the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall reduce or eliminate the amount of the fine arising out
of the parking infraction. If the fine is reduced or eliminated and the person
has previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the revised fine
shall be returned to the person; if the fine is reduced or eliminated and the
person has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay only the amount
of the revised fine. If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the
explanation does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the parking
infraction, the person owes the entire amount of the fine arising out of the
parking infraction, and if the person has not previously paid the fine, the
person shall pay the entire amount of the fine. If a person admits that he
committed a parking infraction with explanation and the person fails to pay the
amount of the fine due within fourteen (14) days after the Parking Violations
Bureau's determination is mailed to the person by first class mail with a
certificate of mailing, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the
Parking Violations Bureau's determination and the amount of the fine due shall
be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a judgment rendered
subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to Division (b) of Section
355.07 hereof.
      (3)   A person, who denies that he committed a parking infraction, shall
be granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time, and place of the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
355.07 hereof.
   (c)    If a person, who is personally or constructively served with a
parking ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction, fails to timely
answer the charge, as provided in Division (a) of this Section, the Parking
Violations Bureau shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant
to Section
355.06 hereof, and proceed according to that Section. Failure to answer the
charge within the ten (10) day period provided by Division (a) of this Section,
shall result in the imposition of an additional penalty of ten dollars
($10.00).
   (d)    The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking
Violations Bureau.

infractions as follows:

such person is not the owner of the vehicle, as determined from the records of
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles, a notification of infraction also shall be sent
to the owner at his most recent address appearing in such records;
      (2)    If the person, who fails to answer, was the owner of the vehicle

this state, may be denied as provided in Ohio R.C. 4521.10 for nonpayment of
    judgments or default judgments entered pursuant to this chapter.
   (c)    A person, who receives a notification of infraction pursuant to this
Section, may answer the parking infraction with which he is charged that is

355.05 hereof for answers to parking infractions charged in a parking ticket,
except that if the answer includes payment of the fine arising out of the
parking infraction any penalty, fee, or cost arising out of such infraction
also shall be paid. The answer shall be governed by the provisions of Division
(b) of Section
 355.05 hereof for answers relative to parking infractions charged in a parking
ticket, except that any determination of the amount to be paid under an answer

(Ord. 2016-17. Passed 9-19-16.)
355.07 HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)    If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives a
notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction. Notice of the
hearing shall be mailed to the person by first class mail. Each hearing shall
be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. Each
hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner considers
appropriate. Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be
strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
   At the hearing, the Village of Carey has the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being
conducted committed the parking infraction. If the person, in his answer,
denied that he committed the parking infraction and requested the presence at
the hearing of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the
officer shall be required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner
determines that the officer's presence is not required. If the officer's
presence at the hearing has been requested and the officer is unable to attend
the hearing on the day and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may
grant a reasonable continuance. The person for whom the hearing is being
conducted may present any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing. The
person does not have to attend the hearing if he submits documentary evidence
to the hearing examiner prior to the day of the hearing. The Village of Carey
shall submit the original parking ticket that was personally or constructively
served on the person or a true copy of that ticket, and information from the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the vehicle. The ticket
and the information in proper form is prima-facie evidence that the registered
owner of the vehicle was the person who committed the parking infraction. The
Village of Carey may present additional evidence and testimony at the hearing.
The Village of Carey does not have to be represented at the hearing by an
attorney.
   (b)   (1)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
Division (a) of    this Section appears at the scheduled hearing or submits
evidence in accordance with that division, the hearing examiner shall consider
all evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the Village of
Carey has established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person
committed the parking infraction. If the hearing examiner determines that the
person committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a
judgment against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate
fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)    If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under Division
(a) of    this Section fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to
submit evidence in accordance with that Division, the hearing examiner shall,
if he determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the     person to pay
the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and costs. A default
judgment entered under this Division shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)    If a person, who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
 355.06 hereof, does not timely answer, as provided in Division (c) of that
Section, the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and     require
the person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees, and
costs. A default judgment entered under this division shall be entered in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)    If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in Division (b)(1),
(2), or (3) of this Section committed the parking infraction, the hearing    
examiner shall enter judgment against the Village of Carey, shall dismiss the
charge of the parking infraction against the person, and shall enter the
judgment and dismissal in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)    A default judgment entered under this Section may be vacated by
the hearing examiner who entered it if all of the following apply:
         A.    The person against whom the default judgment was entered files
    a motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one (1) year of the date
of entry of the judgment;
         B.    The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose; and
         C.    The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person's
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
      (6)    A copy of the determination of the hearing examiner shall be hand
delivered to the person or mailed to the person by first class mail.
   (c)    Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this Section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten (10) days of the
date of entry. All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment of default judgment
shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the Village of Carey and the
Violations Clerk shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its
disbursement in the records of the Parking Violations Bureau. If payment is not
made within this time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed
with the office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so filed, shall
have the same force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered
in the Court.
   As required by Division (C) of Ohio R.C. 4521.08, judgments and default
judgments filed with the Upper Sandusky County Municipal Court, office of the
Clerk of Court, Civil Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and
judgment roll from other judgments rendered in that Court. Computer printouts,
microfilm, microdot, microfiche, or other similar data recording techniques may
be utilized to record such judgments. When a judgment or default judgment is
filed with the Court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be
taken for its collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid
money judgment in a civil action rendered in that Court. The Municipal Court
may assess additional costs against the judgment debtor, in an amount not
exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) for each parking infraction, to be paid upon
satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)    Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is entered
pursuant to this Section and the Village of Carey if judgment is entered
against the City pursuant to this Section may appeal the judgment or default
judgment to the Upper Sandusky Municipal Court by filing notices of appeal with
the Parking Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within fifteen (15) days
of the date of entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable
costs as the Court requires. Upon the filing of an appeal, the Court shall
schedule a hearing date and notify the parties of the date, time, and place of
the hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with the

   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. (ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
 501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.
   501.14 CONSPIRACY.

or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.
         (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.02.
      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
 545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
 545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

   721.01 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   No person, firm, association or corporation shall commence to drill a well
for oil and/or gas within the corporate limits of the Municipality until such
time as that person, firm, association or corporation has wholly complied with
all provisions of this chapter and permission has been granted to the person,
firm, association or corporation by the issuance of a drilling permit.
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)
   721.02  PERMIT; FEE AND BOND.
   (a)    Any person, firm, association or corporation desiring to drill a well
for oil and/or gas within the corporate limits of the Municipality shall make
application for a permit to the Fiscal Officer.
   (b)    A fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000) shall be paid to the
Municipality at the time such application is filed. This fee shall be for the
purpose of defraying the expenses of administration and enforcement of
regulatory ordinances concerning drilling oil and/or gas wells within the
corporate limits of the Municipality and to defray the expenses of inspections
of oil and/or gas well sites prior to and during drilling and at the time such
wells are pulled and plugged.
   (c)    Any person, firm, association or corporation at the time of
application shall also file with the Fiscal Officer a surety bond with
liability on the bond conditioned upon compliance with this chapter until time
of completion of drilling, plugging or abandonment of such well or wells. The
bond shall be in the amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for one well or in
lieu of a bond for each well, a blanket bond for all wells in the amount of
five thousand dollars ($5,000).
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)
   721.03  APPLICATION FOR PERMIT.
   (a)    Any applicant for a permit shall be required to file with the
application an affidavit stating that the applicant has complied with all
conditions of this chapter or setting forth any exceptions thereto. Any false
statement in such affidavit shall be grounds to refuse to issue a permit to
drill or shall be grounds to revoke a permit already issued.
   (b)    No permit shall be issued for the drilling of an oil and/or gas well
except upon real estate owned by the applicant for such permit, or held by such
applicant under a lease or drilling contract from the owner, giving such
applicant permission to drill such well. Nothing herein, nor any permit issued
hereunder shall be deemed to grant any right or license to the permittee to
enter upon or occupy any land, or to commence in any respect upon drilling or
production operations thereon except by the written permission of the owners.
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)
   721.04 REVOCATION OR REFUSAL OF PERMIT.
   (a)    Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be grounds
to refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be grounds to revoke a permit
already issued. Revocation of a permit shall remove all right of the permittee
to drill for oil and/or gas until such time as the permittee takes steps to
come into compliance with this chapter. Operations carried on by the permittee
after revocation of permit shall constitute a violation of this chapter and
shall be a misdemeanor punishable under the provisions of Section
721.99.
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)
   721.05 DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   No drilling shall be permitted for oil and/or gas wells within 200 feet of
residential and mercantile buildings, or any school, church, hospital, theater
or assembly hall as the same are defined by the statutes of the State. In the
case of a particular installation where compliance with the distance
requirements may be a handicap to the use of the property and where no undue
hazard will be created, the 200 foot distance may be reduced at the discretion
of Council after due consideration of such special features as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the adjoining
property, proximity of storage tanks, degree of fire protection provided and
the facilities available at the fire department to cope with controlling liquid
fires. The features provided herein are not to be construed as a limitation on
matters which Council may consider. Council has the right to consider any and
all other special features it may consider important in determining whether or
not an undue hazard is created.
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)
   721.06 INSURANCE.
   Before an application for a permit is granted, the Fiscal Officer shall be
provided with a policy of or certificate of insurance, covering the applicant's
liability for property damage in the amount of not less than three hundred
thousand dollars ($300,000) and the applicant's liability for personal injury
in an amount of not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000). The
insurance policy or policies must be maintained for such period of time as
drilling is in process, the well is in operation or is producing oil and/or gas
or until such well is pulled and plugged. The insurance policies and the
coverages thereunder must be to the complete satisfaction of the Municipality
and such policies may be rejected by the Municipality for any valid reason.
Rejection of the policies shall serve to stay the granting of a permit until
such time as an insurance policy providing coverage entirely satisfactory to
the Municipality has been provided by the applicant.
(Ord. 586. Passed 4-6-64.)

or wastes having a 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), greater than 200 mg/
l, or containing more than 200 mg/l by weight of Suspended Solids, or
containing any quantity of substances having the characteristics described
herein, or having a daily average flow greater than twenty-two percent of the
average daily sewage flow of the Village, shall be subject to reviewer and
approval of the Village Administrator. If so ordered, the owner shall provide
at his expense, such preliminary treatment as may be necessary to reduce the
BOD and Suspended Solids to 200 mg/l, or reduce objectionable characteristics
or constituents to within maximum limits provided for in this section, or
control the quantities and rates of discharge of such waters and wastes.
   Plans and specifications and other pertinent information relating to the
proposed pretreatment facility shall be submitted for the approval of the
Village Administrator and to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency for said
approval, and no construction of any facility shall be commenced until such
approvals are obtained in writing.

   (h)   Evaluation.  The Village Administrator shall evaluate the completed
disclosure form and data furnished by the discharger and may require additional
information or data to be furnished by the discharger. The Village
Administrator shall sign and date each disclosure form at the time of
evaluation. Within thirty days of the receipt of the data furnished, the
Village Administrator shall notify the discharger of the Village's acceptance
or non-acceptance thereof.
   An approval disclosure form is necessary to meet the requirements of this
Chapter. When the disclosure form requires additional information to be
submitted by the discharger before acceptance or non-acceptance can be
determined, the Village Administrator shall provide an appropriate time.
   (i)   Pollutants Discovered.  If the Disclosure form indicates a need for
additional pretreatment, the Village may require pretreatment of discharge
sewerage, industrial waste or other wastes. Thereafter following the discovery
in a discharge of hitherto unknown pollutant(s), which may exceed the limits of
this chapter, the discharger shall file within thirty days with the Village, a
method of disclosing the source and quantity of the pollutant. A time schedule
of activities which will produce the required information shall be submitted at
the same time for review and concurrence by the Village.
   (j)   Additional Pre-Treatment.  Where additional pretreatment and/or O and
M activities will be required to comply with this chapter, the discharger shall
provide a declaration of the shortest schedule by which the discharger will
provide such additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional
operational and maintenance activities. The discharger's declaration shall be
known as the compliance schedule and shall be subject to the following
requirements:
      (1)   The schedule shall contain the dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the discharger to comply with the
requirement of this chapter including, but not limited to dates relating to

construction, and all other acts to achieve compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Under no circumstances shall the Village permit a time increment
for any single step directed toward compliance which exceeds three months
except that the Village Administrator may extend the three month limit when, in
his discretion, it is in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare
to do so.
      (3)   Not later than fourteen days following each of the milestone dates
in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the discharger shall submit
a progress report to the Village, including no less than a statement as to
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that
milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule. In no event
shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the
Village. The Village will evaluate the compliance schedule furnished by the
discharger and may require additional information. Within thirty days full
evaluation of the compliance schedule, the Village shall notify the discharger
of the Village's acceptance or non-acceptance thereof.
   A violation of the accepted Compliance Schedule is a violation of this
chapter.
   (k)   Standards Modification. The Village reserves the right to amend this
chapter and the terms and conditions hereof in order to assure compliance of
the Village with applicable laws and regulations. When the Federal EPA or the
State EPA shall promulgate any amendments to the National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard which affects discharges to the POTW, this chapter shall
be amended to require compliance by Dischargers with such standards within the
time frame prescribed bar such standards. All National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards and all State Discharge Standards adopted after the promulgation of
this chapter shall be adopted by the Village as a part of this chapter. Where a
Discharger, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or State
Discharge Standards has not previously submitted a disclosure form as required
by this section, the Discharger shall file a disclosure form with the Village
within 180 days after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. EPA or State Discharge Standard. In addition,
any Discharger operating on the basis of a previously filed disclosure
statement, shall submit to the Village within 180 days after the promulgation
of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard or State Discharge
Standard, any additional information required by the U.S.EPA or the Ohio EPA
Pretreatment Standards. The Discharger shall be informed of any proposed
changes in this chapter at least thirty days prior to the effective date of
such change. Any changes or new conditions in this chapter shall include a
reasonable time schedule or compliance The limitations set on toxic pollutants
shall be evaluated by the dischargers of the toxic pollutants discharged to the
Village when one of the following conditions exists:
      (1)    One year after implementation of this chapter and every year
thereafter.
      (2)    Any time the effluent from the sewage treatment plant is
consistently above or below the water quality standards or effluent limits
established by the Ohio EPA.
   (l)   Reporting Requirements For Dischargers.
      (1)   Compliance Date Report.  Within thirty days following the date for
final compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment standards set
forth in this chapter or thirty days following commencement of the introduction
of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any discharger subject this
chapter shall submit to the Village a report indicating the nature and
concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its
discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall
state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O and M and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger into compliance with the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be
signed by an executive of the company or by an authorized agent thereof.
   (m)    Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)    Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard or, in
the case of the new discharger, after the commencement of the discharge to the
Village, shall submit to the Village during the months of June and December,
unless required more frequently by the Village, a report indicating for three
consecutive days the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated
substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards
hereof. In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows
shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where
cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Village may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.
   The Village, for good cause shown, considering such factors as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, or other extenuating factors, may
authorize the submission of such reports on months other than those specified
above. Should a report of any daily composite sampling show a violation of the
maximum daily limit, the discharger will be required to report fourteen
consecutive calendar days of sampling performed for the pollutant(s) in
violation. This sampling must be completed within thirty calendar days of the
notification of the violation. If the results of the sampling show violation
does occur, then the discharger will be notified that a new compliance schedule
is required. If the sampling indicates no additional violations, then no
further action will be required by the discharger at that time. Where
categorical standards allow for a four-day average limit and the report of
scheduled sampling show the discharge exceeded the four-day average but within
the maximum daily limit, the discharger will perform a second sampling for all
the parameters of concern. If the second sampling again indicates the discharge
is in excess of the four-day average, the discharger will be notified and will
be required to report seven days of sampling for that parameter to show the
pollutant does not exceed the allowable limits.
      (2)    Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the Village. The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard or at intervals determined to be necessary by
the Village. If pollutant concentration in the discharge is of such varying
nature, or if there is a reasonable risk of a slug of a pollutant that a grab
sample of the wastewater cannot be relied upon to furnish a representative
analysis of the industry's discharge, then the Village may require the
installation of special sampling devices. These may include a continuous
sampling pump coupled to a flow meter in such a way that the size of the sample
is proportional to the total flow. The discharger shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples. Samples shall be
collected in such a manner as to be representative of the composition of
wastes. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to ensure
their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was
taken. (Including preservatives, cooling, etc. required by 40 CFR Part 136
Procedures.)
   (n)    Analysis. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of the
industrial wastes shall be those set forth in 40 CFR Part 136 as amended.
   (o)    Monitoring Facilities:  Each discharger shall provide and operate at
the discharger's own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of each sewer discharge in the Village. Each
monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except
where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
discharger, the Village may concur with the facility being constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscape or parked vehicles. There shall be ample
room in or near the monitoring facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis. The facility and sampling and measuring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the discharger if so required. All monitoring
facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with all
applicable local construction standards and specifications, as well as all
state standards. Construction shall be completed within ninety days of receipt
of written notice from the Village directing the discharger to construct a
monitoring facility. All sewer shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or
structure with an opening of no less than twenty-four inches diameter and
internal diameter of no less than forty-eight inches containing flow measuring,
recording and sampling equipment as required by the Village to ensure
compliance with this section. Such structure may be utilized by the discharger
for his monitoring program once approved by the Village.
   (p)   Inspection and Sampling.  The Village may inspect the monitoring
facility of any discharger to determine compliance with the requirements of
this chapter. The discharger shall allow the Village or its representatives to
enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the
purpose of inspection, sampling or record examination. The Village shall have
the right to set up on the discharger's premises necessary devices to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring, metering operations or all of
these. The Village shall have the right to copy the discharger’s records
relevant to determining compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (q)    Confidential Information:  Information and data furnished to the
Village with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restrictions
unless the discharger specifically requests in writing that the release of
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of proprietary information of the
discharger. When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of
a report which may disclose trade secrets of secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination system (NPDES) permit, the State Disposal
system permit, the pretreatment programs, or all of these, provided however,
that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the State of Ohio
or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement involving the discharger
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the Village as
confidential shall not be transmitted to any party except as provided herein
and unless a ten-day notification is given to the discharger by certified mail.
   (r)   Surcharges:  In the event that a normal discharger is discharging
wastes which are in excess of the normal sewage characteristics, the Village
Administrator may agree to accept these waste without pretreatment, If, in the
opinion of the Village Administrator the wastes will not have detrimental
effects upon the POTW or cause the POTW to exceed its NPDES permit limitations.
In such cases the Village Administrator shall impose a surcharge based on the
following:
      (1)   B.O.D: $0.35 per pound of BOD in excess of normal strength sewage.
      (2)   Total Suspended Solids: $0.45 per pound in excess of normal
strength sewage.
      (3)   Phosphorus as P: $1.44 per pound in excess of 4 mg/l.
      (4)   C.O.D.: $0.35 per pound of COD in excess of normal strength 800 mg/
1.
 
   NOTE: At a COD over 800 mg/1, discharger is subject to the surcharge plus
additional fines based on severity and history, a Compliance Review and
possible revocation of their discharge Sewer Use Permit.
   The above calculations are made on the following formula:
 
   F x 8.34 x (CA-CB) x S = DS where:
   F = average daily industrial flow in millions of gallons per day.
   CA = surcharged parameter in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
   CB = normal strength waste for any surchargeable parameter.
   (B.O.D. = 200) (TSS = 200) (PO4 = 25 mg/1) (COD = 600 mg/1).
   S = surcharge amount per pound of surchargeable parameter
   DS= daily surcharge

be an amount per foot of frontage equal to that which would have been assessed
at the time of the installation.
   The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined by dividing the cost of
the water main paid by the Municipality or person by the frontage abutting the
main, providing the total amount of reimbursement shall not exceed fifty
percent or three dollars fifty cents ($3.50) per foot of property served,
whichever is the lesser.
   (i)    A person, to be eligible for this reimbursement, must file with the
Municipality within ninety days after the completion of the water main or such

   1305.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures, for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Carey, State of Ohio does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of Carey, Ohio are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed
to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of specific flood hazard,
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its purpose,
this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

   1305.03 GENERAL PROVISIONS,
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Carey
as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including any
addition flood hazard areas annexed by the Village of Carey that are not
identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood Insurance Study
for the Village of Carey". This study, with accompanying Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps and any revisions thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
Flood Insurance Study is on file at Village Hall.
   (c)   Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations
which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter unless specifically
exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in Section
1305.04(b).
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over this chapter.
   (f)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village of Carey, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (g)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall constitute a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Any person who violates this chapter or fails
to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall upon conviction
thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided by the laws of the Village of Carey.
Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village of Carey from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The
Village of Carey shall prosecute any violation of this chapter in accordance
with the penalties stated herein.
(Ord. 94-6. Passed 7-18-94.)
   1305.04 ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Establishment of Development Permit. A Development Permit shall be
obtained from the Village Administrator before construction or development
begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section
1305.03(b). Application for a Development Permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Village Administrator and may include, but not be limited to:
site specific topographic plans drawn to scale showing the nature, locations
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. The following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with Section
1305.05(b)(2)A. where base flood elevation data are utilized.
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1305.05(b)(2)A. where base flood elevation data are utilized.
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
   (b)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a
Development Permit shall be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than $1,000.00. Any
proposed action exempt from filing a Development Permit is also exempt from the
standards of this chapter.
   (c)   Designation of the Flood Damage Prevention Administrator.  The Village
Administrator is hereby appointed to administer and implement this chapter by
granting or denying development permit applications in accordance with its
provisions.
   (d)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Village Administrator. The duties
and responsibilities of the Village Administrator shall include but are not
limited to:
      (1)   Permit review.
         A.   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary
permits have been received form those federal, state or local governmental
agencies from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be
responsible for obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by
the Department of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
         C.   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of Section
1305.05(c)(1) is met.
      (2)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of
special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with Section
1305.03(b), are designated as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. Within these areas, the Village Administrator shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state, or other source, including data obtained under Section
1305.05(b)(6), in order to administer Section
1305.05(b)(1), (2) and (c).
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood
elevation data are utilized within areas of special flood hazard on a
community's Flood Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data,
the following provisions apply:
         A.   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
         B.   For all new or substantially-improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed, and,
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in
subsection (a)(3).
         C.   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses.
         A.   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
         B.   Maintain engineering documentation required in subsection (a)(4)
that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said
water-course will not be diminished.
         C.   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the
altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying
capacity will not be diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of flood boundaries.  Make interpretation, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
subsection (e) hereof.
   (e)   Variance Procedure.
      (1)   Appeal Board.
         A.   The Appeals Board as established by the Village of Carey shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
         B.   The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Village Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
         C.   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Wyandot County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         D.   In passing upon such application, the Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter, and:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others:
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated developments;
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         E.   Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (e)(1)D. hereof
and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
         F.   The Village Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request.
      (2)   Conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         C.   Generally, variances may be issued for a new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (e)(1)D. hereof have
been considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         D.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
         E.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
subsection (e)(1)D. hereof, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         F.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
flood elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
            (Ord. 94-6. Passed 7-18-94.)

floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1305.04(d)(2). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion
potential. The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If subsection (c)(1) hereof is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (b).
      (3)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Village Administrator to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must
meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

   (a)    No person shall lease, let, permit the occupancy of, permit the
continuation of the occupancy of or continue the occupancy of, any structure or
building or any portion thereof used for human habitation unless such structure
or building or portion thereof is free from unclean and unsanitary conditions,
as defined in the subsequent sections of this chapter, and unless the
provisions of such subsequent sections are complied with.
   (b)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. A

(Ord. 89-6. Passed 4-17-89.)
   1313.03  STANDARDS OF CLEANLINESS.
   Any structure or building or any portion thereof used for human habitation
shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition by reason of any
portion of such building being infected with a communicable disease, or by
reason of the absence therein of toilet facilities as required by law or by
reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or thereon and also be deemed
unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or harmful to the lives
or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited portion of the house
being damp or wet, or by reason of lack of repair, or by reason of an
accumulation of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or dangerous
substances or liquids, or by reason of defects in or, lack of repair of or,
improper use of the drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or by reason of the

thereof used for human habitation which is in such unclean or unsanitary
condition is hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance.
(Ord. 89-6. Passed 4-17-89.)

   (a)    Whenever the County Board of Health ascertains from examination or
reports of its inspectors or sanitary officers or other agents that a public
nuisance exists as defined in Section
1313.03 in or upon any structure or building or portion thereof and is of the
opinion that such nuisance may be abated without immediate vacation of the
premises or a portion thereof and serves notice upon the owner of such house,
or his lessee or agent or the person in possession, charge or control thereof,
directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the unclean or unsanitary
conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by such Board and
specified in such notice, it shall then be the duty of such owner, agent or
person to abate such nuisance within such time.
   (b)    Whenever such abatement does not take place within such time or,
whenever, in the opinion of such Board, such abatement is impossible or
impracticable without an immediate vacation of the house or portion thereof,
and such Board serves notice upon the owner, lessee, agent or person in
possession, charge or control thereof to vacate or cause the vacation of such
house or portion thereof designated in the notice, then it shall be the duty of
such owner, lessee, agent or person to vacate or cause the vacation of such
house or portion thereof within twenty days from the date of the service of
such notice, or within a shorter time (not less than twenty-four hours in any
case) as may be specified in such notice.
   (c)    Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of such
notices on such owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control
the Board is of the opinion that such nuisance can be abated by a tenant or
other occupant of such house or portion thereof, and such notices, either for
abatement of the nuisance or for vacation of the premises, are served upon such
tenant or other occupant, then it shall be the duty of such tenant or other
occupant to comply with the terms of such notices and to abate the nuisance or
vacate the premises accordingly. After any such notice or order of vacation no
person shall occupy or permit the occupancy of such premises or portion thereof
until such nuisance has been completely abated and such building or portion
thereof has been rendered clean and sanitary in accordance with the terms of
such notices of the Board. When there is no owner, agent, lessee or person in
charge, possession or control who is a resident of or can be served in the
Village, then personal service outside of the Village on any such owner, agent,
lessee or person in charge, possession or control by anyone delegated by such
Board to make such service, or by registered letter, or if the address of the
owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control is unknown, or
service is not secured by registered letter after effort to do so, by notice by
publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of general
circulation in the Village, or by posting or attaching to or on the outside of
such structure or building of a copy of the notice or order consecutively for

   When the notice or order of vacation follows a notice or order of abatement,
as provided in Section
 1313.04 such notice or order of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in
this chapter unless such notice or order of abatement specifies a time when the
person so notified or ordered may appear before the County Board of Health or
the officer issuing the same to show cause why such order or notice of vacation
should not be issued, and unless such Board, or a majority thereof, or officer
is present at its or his office at the time so specified, such time to be not
less than twenty-four hours after the service of the notice or order. When the
notice or order of vacation is issued as provided in Section
1313.04, without a previous notice or order of abatement, such notice or order
of vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this chapter unless it
specifies a time, not less than five days after the service thereof, when the
person so notified or ordered may appear before the Board issuing the same to
show cause why such notice or order should not be enforced, and such Board, or
a majority thereof, is present at its office at the time so specified. However,
when, in the opinion of at least four-fifths of the members of such Board, an
emergency exists which requires, for the protection of the health of occupants,

appropriate or necessary for the enforcement of such order or notice and the
abatement of the nuisance against which such order or notice was directed, such

found after reasonable and diligent search, notice may then be sent to the last
known address of such person, and a copy of such notice may be posted in a
conspicuous place on the structure or premises to which it relates. The notice

with the Zoning Inspector within twenty days of his receipt of the order,
specifying the grounds therefore. The Property Maintenance Inspector and Zoning
Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a
reasonable time for public hearing of the appeal, giving at least thirty days
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and at least
twenty days notice to all parties having a legal interest in the property. An
appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from.
The Board may reverse, affirm in whole or in part, or may modify the order
appealed from. Any party adversely affected by a decision of the Board may
further appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Wyandot County, Ohio.
   (b)   If no appeal is taken by the affected owner, occupant, operator or
agent, or if an appeal is taken and the Board affirms the decision of the
Property Maintenance Inspector, and if upon further inspection it is found that
the order has not been complied with, Council shall, by resolution, direct the
owner, occupant, operator or agent in charge of such property to comply within
ten days. Such resolution shall provide that upon failure or refusal to comply
with the order, the work required will be performed by the Village with the
amount expended therefore to be a valid claim against such owner, occupant,
operator or agent and recovered by the Village as an assessment against the
individual and/or the property or by suit in a court of competent jurisdiction.
