EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

imposed by the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, or any other duly

      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.

202.06 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   (a)   All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the
Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
   (b)   In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if it is of a kind
required to be in conformity with State law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the
Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the provision of these Codified Ordinances shall
control.
   (c)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (d)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (e)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (f)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of an act is required or the failure to do
an act is declared to be unlawful, the Commission or performance of such act,
or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall, unless
another penalty is provided, be deemed a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and
the offender shall be fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both, for each offense. Unless
otherwise provided, a separate offense shall be deemed committed each day
during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.
(Ord. 1979-17. Passed 2-14-79.)
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.

222.01 ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS DISTINGUISHED.
   As used in these Codified Ordinances:
   (a)   "Ordinance" means a rule established by authority; a permanent rule of
action; a law. In its most common meaning, the term is used to designate the
enactments of the legislative body of a municipal corporation. It designates a
local law of a municipal corporation, duly enacted by the proper authorities,
prescribing general, uniform and permanent rules of conduct relating to the
corporate affairs of the municipality. An ordinance is the equivalent of a
municipal statute, passed by the legislative authority and governing matters
not already covered by Federal or State law. Ordinances commonly govern zoning,
building, safety, etc., matters of a municipality.
   (b)   "Resolution" means a formal expression of the opinion or will of an
official body or a public assembly, adopted by vote as a legislative
resolution. Such may be either a simple, joint or concurrent resolution.
      The term is usually employed to denote the adoption of a motion, the
subject matter of which would not properly constitute a statute or such as a
mere expression of opinion; an alteration of the rules; a vote of thanks or of
censure, etc.
      The chief distinction between a "resolution" and an "ordinance" is that
the former is used whenever the legislative body passing it wishes merely to
express an opinion as to some given matter or thing and is only to have a
temporary effect on such particular thing, while by an ordinance is intended to
permanently direct and control matters applying to persons or things in
general. An ordinance is legislative; a resolution is ministerial. An ordinance
establishes a more permanent influence on the community than a resolution does.
It is a permanent rule of conduct; a resolution is a temporary mode of action,
special in character.
222.02 PUBLICATION.
   (a)   All ordinances and resolutions adopted by Council shall be published
by posting a true copy thereof for a period of ten days in the four most public
places in the Village, which are determined to be as follows:
      (1)   The Village Hall, 4863 East 71st Street.
      (2)   The Police Department, 5480 Grant Avenue.
      (3)   The Fire Department, 5480 Grant Avenue.
      (4)   The Service Department, 7201 Canal Road.
   (b)   The posting shall be made on the day following the approval of the
minutes of the adoption of the ordinances and resolutions. Upon completion of
the publication, the Clerk shall certify the period of the posting upon the
record of each ordinance or resolution.

applicant has a current, valid LEADS/NCIC certification; and
      (2)   Uniformed services credits pursuant to Section
246.09(a)(4).

order of their relative excellence as determined by the examination with the
relevant bonus points added. In the event that two or more applicants for
initial appointment receive the same total point score, inclusive of credits,
priority shall be determined by lot. This eligibility list shall then be

sick leave used, employees shall be debited with the actual number of hours of
absence from work.

in any agency of government where attendance records are maintained and credit
has been given to employees for unused sick leave.

254.14 POLICY STATEMENT ON HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (a)   The Village is committed to courteous and considerate treatment of its
employees at all times as an accepted standard of behavior. Consequently, the
Village is committed to a work atmosphere that is free of tension caused by
demeaning or harassing conduct, including animosity engendered by inappropriate
religious, racial or sexual conduct or comments.
   (b)   Equal employment opportunity laws identify two basic types of unlawful
sexual harassment:
      (1)   Where submission to unwelcome sexual advances and other physical or
verbal conduct is made a term or condition of an individual's employment, such
as demanding that a subordinate accept a date with a supervisor in order for
the subordinate to keep his or her job; and
      (2)   Where such conduct interferes with an individual's work performance
or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.
   (c)   Sexual harassment is specifically prohibited by the Village's
policies. It is the obligation of each person to report any conduct which
violates these standards whether he or she is the victim or not, whether the
perpetrator is a supervisor, Councilmember, director, staff member or business
guest and regardless of the sex of the perpetrator.
   (d)   Any violation should be promptly reported to an employee's immediate
supervisor, to any supervisory person who the employee feels is the most
appropriate under the circumstances, or directly to the Mayor.
   (e)   The Village Law Director and /or Assistant Law Director will
immediately conduct a confidential investigation of any complaint, protecting
the identity of the complaining party, witnesses and the individual alleged to
have violated the policy, to the extent possible. A complaint made in good
faith assures that the complainant shall be protected from any retaliatory
action. Appropriate action will be taken if a violation of policy has occurred,
up to and including termination of employment, as determined by the Mayor and/
or Council.

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
         Chap.
290.     Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Cuyahoga Heights
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Cuyahoga Heights ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes
involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within
the corporate limits of Cuyahoga Heights, subject to the limitations of Ohio
R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor
shall be governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Cuyahoga County (the Garfield Heights Municipal Court) and the
magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript
of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to
the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury
trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a
jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further
limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his
or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his
or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury at
any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any Cuyahoga
Heights ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of Practice
and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common Pleas," the
adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended Rules,
referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1, 1975.
Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to suspend
the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section 434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

as court costs for each defendant convicted in the Mayor's Court.
   (c)   The Mayor may disburse funds from the Fund, upon appropriation by
Council, in an amount no greater than the actual cost of procuring and
maintaining computer systems for the office of Clerk of the Mayor's Court.
   (d)   The Clerk of Council is hereby authorized to send a certified copy of
this section to the Bureau of Inspection and Supervision of Ohio Public Offices
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5705.12.
   (e)   Interest earned by the Fund shall be credited to the Fund.
(Ord. 1995-55. Passed 4-12-95.)

   (a)   There is hereby established a special fund to be known as the Mayor's

Police Department to pay only those costs it incurs in enforcing Ohio R.C.
4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code.
(Ord. 1990-104. Passed 9-26-90.)
290.05 INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.
   (a)   Court May Require Installment Payments. Upon a plea that a person is
unable to pay any fine imposed under the Village Traffic Code or General
Offenses Code, the Court may permit payments in monthly installments as may be
agreeable to the defendant and the court until the fine is satisfied in full.
   (b)   Balance Due Upon Any Default. Upon default by the defendant in the
payment of any such installment, the entire balance of the fine shall
immediately be due and payable by the defendant.
   (c)   Notice of Default. The Court shall send one notice of default to the
defendant ordering the defendant to pay the balance of the fine in full or face

distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding R.C. § 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than $100 as follows:
         A.   1.   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer
issues an offender a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of any of the
aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
         B.   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
(R.C. § 4511.991)
408.03 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start to
cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in R.C. § 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing
a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the
roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;

shall not be deemed a conviction for any purpose and shall not be made part of
the operating record of any person upon whom the liability is imposed.
   (b)   The Chief of Police shall be responsible for administering the
automated speed enforcement program. Specifically, the Chief of Police shall be
empowered to deploy and operate the automated speed enforcement system within
the Village.
   (c)   A traffic law violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under

present at the location of the device at all times during the operation of the
device and if the local authority complies with this
Chapter 418.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who is present at the location of any
traffic law photo- monitoring device and who personally witnesses a traffic law
violation may issue a ticket for the violation. Such a ticket shall be issued

Passed 2-11-15.)
418.03   SIGNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   The Village shall not use traffic law photo-monitoring devices to
enforce any traffic law violation until after it has done both of the

boundary of the or within 300 feet of the fixed system location, as applicable.
If the signs cannot be located within the first 300 feet of the boundary of the
Village or within 300 feet of the fixed system location, the Village shall
erect the signs as close to that distance as possible. If a particular highway
enters and exits the territory of the municipality multiple times, the
municipality shall erect the signs as required by division (a)(1) of this
section at the locations in each direction of travel where inbound traffic on
the highway first enters the territory of the municipality and is not required
to erect additional signs along such highway each time the highway reenters the

associated with the erection, maintenance, and replacement, if necessary, of
the signs. The Village shall ensure that all signs erected under this division
shall conform in size, color, location, and content to standards contained in
the manual adopted by the Department of Transportation pursuant to Ohio R.C.
4511.09 and shall remain in place for as long as the municipality utilizes

            However, if the Village is in substantial compliance with the
requirements of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as applicable, a
ticket issued by the municipality is valid.
   (c)   The municipality is deemed to be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, as applicable, to
erect the advisory signs if the municipality does both of the following:
      (1)   First erects all signs as required by division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of
this section, as applicable, and subsequently maintains and replaces the signs
as needed so that at all times at least 90% of the required signs are in place
and functional;
      (2)   Annually documents and, upon request, certifies its compliance with
division (c)(1) of this section.

detect or enforce any traffic law violation at an intersection where traffic is
controlled by traffic control signals that exhibit different colored lights or
colored lighted arrows, the municipality shall time the operation of the yellow
lights and yellow arrows of those traffic control signals so that the steady
yellow indication exceeds by one second the minimum duration for yellow
indicators at similar intersections as established by the provisions of the
manual adopted by the Department of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4511.09.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)

   (b)   A traffic law violation for which a ticket is issued by the Village
pursuant to
Chapter 418 is a civil violation.
   (c)   The Village or its designee shall process such a ticket for a civil
violation and shall send the ticket by ordinary mail to any registered owner of
the motor vehicle that is the subject of the traffic law violation. The Village
or its designee shall ensure that the ticket contains all of the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the registered owner;

418.04, specifically to include the time, place, and manner in which an
administrative appeal may be initiated and the procedure for disclaiming
liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in this section;
      (11)   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in this Section
418.04 is deemed to be an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity
to contest the violation.
   (d)   The Village or its designee shall send a ticket not later than 30 days
after the date of the alleged traffic law violation.
   (e)   The Village or its designee may elect to send by ordinary mail a
warning notice in lieu of a ticket under this section.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)
418.05   RIGHTS OF THOSE TICKETED.
   (a)   A person or entity who receives a ticket for a civil violation sent in
compliance with Section
418.04 shall elect to do one of the following:
      (1)   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
      (2)   A.   Within 30 days after receipt of the ticket, provide the law
enforcement agency of the Village with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within 48 hours
after the violation occurred.
         B.   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within 30 days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (a)(2)A.1. or 2. of this
section to the Village in a form established by the Village and the following
conditions are met:
            1.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)A.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request
an administrative hearing within 30 days or is determined liable in an
administrative hearing;
            2.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)A.2 of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the law enforcement agency of the Village
of the name and address of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the
time of the traffic law violation. A motor vehicle leasing dealer or motor
vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged traffic law
violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not liable for a
ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of
a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation. The dealer shall not
pay such a ticket and subsequently attempt to collect a fee or assess the
lessee or renter a charge for any payment of such a ticket made on behalf of
the lessee or renter.
      (4)   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the law enforcement agency of the Village an affidavit, sworn to or
affirmed by an agent of the corporate entity, that provides the name and
address of the employee who was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
alleged violation and who is the designated party.
      (5)   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the ticket. The person or entity shall file
the written request not later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket. The
failure to request a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of
the right to contest the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an
admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
   (b)   When the Village receives an affidavit described in division (a)
(2)A.1. or (a)(4) of this section or a notification under division (a)(3) of
this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket that
conforms with Section 418.04(c) to the designated party. The Village shall send
the ticket to the designated party by ordinary mail not later than 21 days
after receipt of the affidavit or notification.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)
418.06   CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a citation from a
police officer at the time of the violation, or unless an exception or defense
to liability set forth in Section
418.04 applies, the owner or responsible party for the motor vehicle is subject
to a civil penalty if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated speed
enforcement system while being operated in violation of this chapter.

hundred dollars ($100.00).
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)
418.07   EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE.
   (a)   A law enforcement officer employed by the Village shall examine
evidence of alleged traffic law violations recorded by the device to determine
whether such a violation has occurred. If the image recorded by the traffic law
photo-monitoring device shows such a violation, contains the date and time of
the violation, and shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the
vehicle involved as well as the state that issued the license plate, the
officer may use any lawful means to identify the registered owner.
   (b)   The fact that a person or entity is the registered owner of a motor
vehicle is prima facie evidence that that person or entity is the person who
was operating the vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
   (c)   Within 30 days of the traffic law violation, the Village or its
designee may issue and send by regular mail a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation. The ticket shall comply with Section
418.04.
   (d)   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation, sworn
to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer employed by the Village, including
by electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and
is admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued under this
section.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)
418.08   CONTESTING TICKETS.
   (a)   When a person or entity named in a ticket for a civil violation under
Section
418.03 elects to contest the ticket and completes the requirements prescribed
in Section
418.05(a)(5) in a timely manner, all of the following apply:
      (1)   A hearing officer appointed by the Village shall hear the case. The
hearing officer shall conduct a hearing not sooner than 21 but not later than
45 days after the filing of a written request for the hearing. The hearing
officer may extend the time period by which a hearing must be conducted upon a
request for additional time by the person or entity who requested the hearing.
      (2)   The hearing officer shall ensure that the hearing is open to the
public. The hearing officer shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the
entrance to the hearing room. The hearing officer shall identify on the docket,
by respondent, the hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each
hearing. The hearing officer may schedule multiple hearings for the same time
to allow for occurrences such as nonappearances or admissions of liability.
      (3)   The person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the
hearing and may present evidence at the hearing.
      (4)   The hearing officer shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur
and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   (1)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
      (2)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but
the person or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating
the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision finding that the individual or entity is not liable for the
violation and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity
named in the ticket.
      (3)   If the person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity
named in the ticket.
      (4)   The hearing officer shall render a decision on the day a hearing
takes place.
   (c)   (1)   In determining whether the person or entity named in the ticket
is liable, the hearing officer may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a traffic law violation:
         A.   That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to
yield the right-of-way to either of the following:
            1.   A public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4511.45 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   A funeral procession in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.451 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
         B.   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within 48 hours after the traffic law violation
occurred.
         C.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
         D.   That the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. In
order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division (c)(1)D. of
this section, the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
shall provide to the hearing officer the identity of the designated party, that
person's name and current address, and any other evidence that the hearing
officer determines to be pertinent.
      (2)   A hearing officer also may consider the totality of the
circumstances when determining whether to impose liability upon the person or
entity named in the ticket.
   (d)   (1)   If the hearing officer finds that the person or entity named in
the ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the hearing
officer shall provide to the Village or its designee, within five days of the
hearing, a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated
party.
      (2)   Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the designated party,
the Village or its designee may issue a ticket to the designated party.
            The Village shall ensure that a ticket issued under division (d)(2)
of this section conforms with Section
418.04. The Village shall send the ticket by ordinary mail not later than 21
days after receipt of the evidence from the hearing officer or the registered
owner of the identity of the designated party.
   (e)   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under division (d)(2) of
this section or Section
418.05(b) contests the ticket by filing a written request for an administrative
hearing to review the ticket not later than 30 days after receipt of the
ticket, the Village shall require the registered owner of the motor vehicle
also to attend the hearing. If at the hearing involving the designated party
the hearing officer cannot determine the identity of the operator of the
vehicle at the time of the violation, the registered owner is liable for the
violation. The hearing officer then shall issue a written decision imposing
liability for the violation on the registered owner and submit it to the
Village or its designee and to the registered owner. If the designated party
also is a registered owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall
follow the order of registered owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (f)   A person who is named in a ticket for a civil violation may assert a
testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2317.02(D).
   (g)   A person or entity may appeal a written decision rendered by a hearing
officer under this section to the municipal court or county court with
jurisdiction over the location where the violation occurred.
   (h)   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of liability
under this section or Section
418.05 is admissible as evidence in any other judicial proceeding in this
state.
(Ord. 2015-15. Passed 2-11-15.)
418.09   COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.
   If a judgment for a civil penalty under this
Chapter 418 is not satisfied, the Village may seek payment on the judgment
amount, together with any applicable interest and costs thereon, in any manner
authorized by law. In addition to any other fees or charges authorized by this
chapter in relation to the commission of a violation thereof, a person liable
for the penalties established under this chapter may be assessed any costs
incurred by the Village in the collection of the debt, including but not
limited to attorneys fees.

device shall provide to the Village the maintenance record of any such device
used in the Village.
   (b)   (1)   Commencing January 2015, not later than the last day of January
of each year, the manufacturer of a traffic law photo-monitoring device shall
provide to the Village a certificate of proper operation that attests to the
accuracy of the device in recording a traffic law violation.
      (2)   In addition to the requirement prescribed in division (b)(1) of
this section, for every such device that is considered mobile, meaning it is
attached to a trailer, vehicle, or other wheeled apparatus so that it is easily
moved to different system locations, both of the following apply:
         A.   The Village shall test the accuracy of each such device with an
independent, certified speed measuring device or some other commonly accepted
method prior to its use at each system location.
         B.   The Village shall clearly and conspicuously mark on the outside
of the trailer, vehicle, or wheeled apparatus that contains the traffic law
photo-monitoring device that the device is contained therein and that the
trailer, vehicle, or wheeled apparatus is the property of the Village.
   (c)   In the case of a traffic law photo-monitoring device that is used at
an intersection to detect violations of
Chapter 414 based on the failure to comply with Ohio R.C. 4511.13 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Village shall not issue a
ticket for a violation based upon evidence recorded by a traffic law photo-
monitoring device when a vehicle makes a legal right or left turn-on-red-signal
if all of the following apply:
      (1)   The vehicle can make the turn safely.
      (2)   The vehicle comes to a complete stop at any point prior to

   The Village shall not issue a ticket for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or
4511.211,
Chapter 434 of the Codified Ordinances, or any other substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance due to failure to observe the applicable speed limit based
upon evidence recorded by a traffic law photo-monitoring device unless one of
the following applies:
   (a)   For a system location that is located within a school zone or within
the boundaries of a state or local park or recreation area, the vehicle
involved in the violation is traveling at a speed that exceeds the posted speed

after the date of the alleged traffic law violation.
   (e)   The Village or its designee may elect to send by ordinary mail a

(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.05   RIGHTS OF THOSE TICKETED.
   (a)   A person or entity who receives a ticket for a civil violation sent in
compliance with this Section
420.05 shall elect to do one of the following:
      (1)   In accordance with instructions on the ticket, pay the civil
penalty, thereby failing to contest liability and waiving the opportunity to
contest the violation;
      (2)   A.   Within 30 days after receipt of the ticket, provide the law
enforcement agency of the Village with either of the following affidavits:
            1.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that
another person was operating the vehicle of the registered owner at the time of
the violation, identifying that person as a designated party who may be held
liable for the violation, and containing at a minimum the name and address of
the designated party;
            2.   An affidavit executed by the registered owner stating that at
the time of the violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates issued to
the motor vehicle were stolen and therefore were in the care, custody, or
control of some person or entity to whom the registered owner did not grant
permission to use the motor vehicle. In order to demonstrate that the motor
vehicle or the license plates were stolen prior to the traffic law violation
and therefore were not under the control or possession of the registered owner
at the time of the violation, the registered owner shall submit proof that a
report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed with the
appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the violation or within 48 hours
after the violation occurred.
         B.   A registered owner is not responsible for a traffic law violation
if, within 30 days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in division (a)(2)A.1. or 2. of this
section to the Village in a form established by the Village and the following
conditions are met:
            1.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)A.1. of this section, the designated party either accepts
liability for the violation by paying the civil penalty or failing to request
an administrative hearing within 30 days or is determined liable in an
administrative hearing;
            2.   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in
division (a)(2)A.2. of this section, the affidavit is supported by a stolen
vehicle or stolen license plate report as required in that division.
      (3)   If the registered owner is a motor vehicle leasing dealer or a
motor vehicle renting dealer, notify the law enforcement agency of the Village
of the name and address of the lessee or renter of the motor vehicle at the
time of the traffic law violation. A motor vehicle leasing dealer or motor
vehicle renting dealer who receives a ticket for an alleged traffic law
violation detected by a law enforcement using an Officer-Operated Handheld
Traffic Law Enforcement Device is not liable for a ticket issued for a motor
vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of a lessee or renter at the
time of the alleged violation. The dealer shall not pay such a ticket and
subsequently attempt to collect a fee or assess the lessee or renter a charge
for any payment of such a ticket made on behalf of the lessee or renter.
      (4)   If the vehicle involved in the traffic law violation is a
commercial motor vehicle and the ticket is issued to a corporate entity,
provide to the law enforcement agency of the Village an affidavit, sworn to or
affirmed by an agent of the corporate entity, that provides the name and
address of the employee who was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
alleged violation and who is the designated party.
      (5)   Contest the ticket by filing a written request for an
administrative hearing to review the ticket. The person or entity shall file
the written request not later than 30 days after receipt of the ticket. The
failure to request a hearing within this time period constitutes a waiver of
the right to contest the violation and ticket, and is deemed to constitute an
admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest the violation.
   (b)   When the Village receives an affidavit described in division (a)
(2)A.1. or (a)(4) of this section or a notification under division (a)(3) of
this section from a registered owner, it may proceed to send a ticket that
conforms with the requirements set forth in Section 420.04 to the designated
party. The Village shall send the ticket to the designated party by ordinary
mail not later than 21 days after receipt of the affidavit or notification.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.06   CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a citation from a
police officer at the time of the violation, or unless an exception or defense
to liability set forth in Section
420.05 applies, the owner or responsible party for the motor vehicle is subject
to a civil penalty if the motor vehicle is recorded by a law enforcement
officer using an Officer-Operated Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device while
being operated in violation of this chapter.
   (b)   The civil penalty under this chapter shall be the following:
      (1)   The civil penalty for a violation of this chapter shall be one
hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00); or
      (2)   If the civil penalty is paid within 30 calendar days of the date of
issuance of the notice of liability, the civil penalty shall be reduced to one
hundred dollars ($100.00).
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.07   EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE.
   (a)   A law enforcement officer employed by the Village shall examine
evidence of alleged traffic law violations recorded by a law enforcement
officer using an Officer-Operated Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device to
determine whether such a violation has occurred. If the image recorded by a law
enforcement officer using an Officer-Operated Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement
Device shows such a violation, contains the date and time of the violation, and
shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the vehicle involved as
well as the state that issued the license plate, the officer may use any lawful
means to identify the registered owner.
   (b)   The fact that a person or entity is the registered owner of a motor
vehicle is prima facie evidence that that person or entity is the person who
was operating the vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
   (c)   Within 30 days of the traffic law violation, the Village or its
designee may issue and send by regular mail a ticket charging the registered
owner with the violation. The ticket shall comply with Section
420.04.
   (d)   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation, sworn
to or affirmed by a law enforcement officer employed by the Village, including
by electronic means, and the recorded images produced by an Officer-Operated
Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device used by a law enforcement officer at
the date, time, and location where a violation occurred, is prima facie
evidence of the facts contained therein and is admissible in a proceeding for
review of the ticket issued under this section.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.08   CONTESTING TICKETS.
   (a)   When a person or entity named in a ticket for a civil violation elects
to contest the ticket and completes the requirements prescribed in Section
420.05 of the Codified Ordinances in a timely manner, all of the following
apply:
      (1)   A hearing officer appointed by the Village shall hear the case. The
hearing officer shall conduct a hearing not sooner than 21 but not later than
45 days after the filing of a written request for the hearing. The hearing
officer may extend the time period by which a hearing must be conducted upon a
request for additional time by the person or entity who requested the hearing.
      (2)   The hearing officer shall ensure that the hearing is open to the
public. The hearing officer shall post a docket in a conspicuous place near the
entrance to the hearing room. The hearing officer shall identify on the docket,
by respondent, the hearings scheduled for that day and the time of each
hearing. The hearing officer may schedule multiple hearings for the same time
to allow for occurrences such as nonappearances or admissions of liability.
      (3)   The person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing shall appear for the
hearing and may present evidence at the hearing.
      (4)   The hearing officer shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that the violation alleged in the ticket did in fact occur
and that the person or entity requesting the review is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)   (1)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did in fact occur and that the person or
entity named in the ticket is the person who was operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision
imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or entity and submit
it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity named in the ticket.
      (2)   If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence
that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in fact occur but
the person or entity named in the ticket is not the person who was operating
the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision finding that the individual or entity is not liable for the
violation and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity
named in the ticket.
      (3)   If the person who requested the administrative hearing or a
representative of the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the
hearing, the hearing officer shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
written decision imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the Village or its designee and the person or entity
named in the ticket.
      (4)   The hearing officer shall render a decision on the day a hearing
takes place.
   (c)   (1)   In determining whether the person or entity named in the ticket
is liable, the hearing officer may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a traffic law violation:
         A.   That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to
yield the right-of-way to either of the following:
            1.   A public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4511.45 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            2.   A funeral procession in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.451 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
         B.   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen prior to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the
control or possession of the registered owner at the time of the violation. In
order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen prior
to the occurrence of the violation and were not under the control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the violation, the registered owner
shall submit proof that a report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed with the appropriate law enforcement agency prior to the
traffic law violation or within 48 hours after the traffic law violation
occurred.
         C.   At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the Officer-Operated
Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device was not in proper position and the
recorded image is not of sufficient legibility to enable an accurate
determination of the information necessary to impose liability.
         D.   That the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
was not the person operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. In
order to meet the evidentiary burden imposed under this division (c)(1)D. of
this section, the registered owner or person or entity named in the ticket
shall provide to the hearing officer the identity of the designated party, that
person's name and current address, and any other evidence that the hearing
officer determines to be pertinent.
      (2)   A hearing officer also may consider the totality of the
circumstances when determining whether to impose liability upon the person or
entity named in the ticket.
   (d)   (1)   If the hearing officer finds that the person or entity named in
the ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence identifying the designated party, the hearing
officer shall provide to the Village or its designee, within five days of the
hearing, a copy of any evidence substantiating the identity of the designated
party.
      (2)   Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the designated party,
the Village or its designee may issue a ticket to the designated party.
            The Village shall ensure that a ticket issued under division (d)(2)
of this section conforms with Section
420.04. The Village shall send the ticket by ordinary mail not later than 21
days after receipt of the evidence from the hearing officer or the registered
owner of the identity of the designated party.
   (e)   If a designated party who is issued a ticket under division (d)(2) of
this section or Section
420.05(b) of the Codified Ordinances contests the ticket by filing a written
request for an administrative hearing to review the ticket not later than 30
days after receipt of the ticket, the Village shall require the registered
owner of the motor vehicle also to attend the hearing. If at the hearing
involving the designated party the hearing officer cannot determine the
identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the
registered owner is liable for the violation. The hearing officer then shall
issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation on the registered
owner and submit it to the Village or its designee and to the registered owner.
If the designated party also is a registered owner of the vehicle, liability
for the violation shall follow the order of registered owners as listed on the
title to the vehicle.
   (f)   A person who is named in a ticket for a civil violation may assert a
testimonial privilege in accordance with Ohio R.C. 2317.02(D).
   (g)   A person or entity may appeal a written decision rendered by a hearing
officer under this section to the Garfield Heights Municipal Court within 30
days of the hearing officer's decision.
   (h)   No decision rendered under this section, and no admission of liability
under this section or Section
420.05, is admissible as evidence in any other judicial proceeding in this
state.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.09   COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.
   (a)   If a judgment for a civil penalty under this
Chapter 420 is not satisfied, the Village may seek payment on the judgment
amount, together with any applicable interest and costs thereon, in any manner
authorized by law. In addition to any other fees or charges authorized by this
chapter in relation to the commission of a violation thereof, a person liable
for the penalties established under this chapter may be assessed any costs
incurred by the Village in the collection of the debt, including but not
limited to attorney’s fees.
   (b)   In the event that the vehicle owner or responsible party fails to take
any action set forth in Section
420.05(a), or after the hearing officer issues a written decision imposing
liability for a traffic law violation under Section
420.08 and the time to appeal such decision has passed without the filing of an
appeal, the Village may initiate a civil enforcement action in the Garfield
Heights Municipal Court.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.10   CALIBRATION; ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN TICKETS PROHIBITED.
   (a)   Upon request, each manufacturer of an Officer-Operated Handheld
Traffic Law Enforcement Device shall provide to the Village the maintenance
record of any such device used in the Village.
   (b)   (1)   Commencing January 2015, not later than the last day of January

Enforcement Device used by the Village shall provide to the Village a
certificate of proper operation that attests to the accuracy of the device.
      (2)   The Village shall test the accuracy of each such Officer-Operated
Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device with an independent, certified speed
measuring device or some other commonly accepted method prior to its use at
each system location.
   (c)   In the case of an Officer-Operated Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement
Device that is used at an intersection to detect violations of
Chapter 414 of the Codified Ordinances based on the failure to comply with Ohio
R.C. 4511.13 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Village
shall not issue a ticket for a violation based upon evidence recorded by a law
enforcement officer using an Officer-Operated Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement
Device when a vehicle makes a legal right or left turn-on-red-signal if all of
the following apply:
      (1)   The vehicle can make the turn safely.
      (2)   The vehicle comes to a complete stop at any point prior to
completing the turn.
      (3)   No pedestrians are in the crosswalk, or are about to enter the
crosswalk, of any approach to the intersection the vehicle occupies while
commencing or making the turn.
(Ord. 2015-17. Passed 3-11-15.)
420.11   SPEEDING TICKETS PROHIBITED.
   The Village shall not issue a ticket for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or
4511.211,
Chapter 434 of the Codified Ordinances, or any other substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance due to failure to observe the applicable speed limit based
upon evidence recorded by a law enforcement officer using an Officer-Operated
Handheld Traffic Law Enforcement Device unless one of the following applies:
   (a)   For a system location that is located within a school zone or within
the boundaries of a state or local park or recreation area, the vehicle
involved in the violation is traveling at a speed that exceeds the posted speed
limit by not less than six miles per hour.

      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;

   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;
         C.   When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

      (2)   Nothing in division (b)(1) of this section requires a driver of a
slower vehicle to compromise the driver’s safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
   (c)   Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two-way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or

distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken. In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet
of any approaching vehicle.

also may impose a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or
nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
         D.   Notwithstanding divisions (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose

      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section
unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or physically

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
this section does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.205 for the same conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a
delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of this section
and is also adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a

            substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer under
R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood
or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.

the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division is not available to a person who
withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.

vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral
fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine if arrested
for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A)
or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other
municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
      (3)    The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but
the officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the
person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever
reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical
test of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall
also advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.

made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance

a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting
officer shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division

Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that

the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.

in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or

operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Auto Dealer's Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   As used in division (g) of this section, "electronic monitoring"
has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01

698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic

the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.

ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to §
698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to §

$1,000; and, notwithstanding §
698.02(e)(1)C. and R.C. § 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant
to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.

within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).

      (3)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or two or more equivalent offenses, driving under OVI suspension is a
misdemeanor. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         A.   A mandatory jail term of 30 consecutive days. Notwithstanding the
jail terms provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence the

assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so

with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

440.01 LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   For regional trips at distances of 150 miles or less from a
facility stated on the application as the applicant’s point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
   (d)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any provision of the Ohio
Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator, electric
bicycle operator, or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a

issue a permit to any person for the shipment or transportation of those
radioactive materials specified in this chapter unless:
      (1)   There is a showing that the radioactive material has been or will
be containerized and packaged and all warning labels affixed to the outer
container holding the radioactive material and the motor vehicle transporting
such material, in conformity with the regulations of the United States
Department of Transportation, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission or
other related Federal or State agencies, regardless of whether the shipment is
being made intracity, intrastate or interstate; and

medical and educational interests, unless they are expressly authorized in
writing by the United States Department of Transportation or by any other

452.05 WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The Police Chief, upon notification to the Police Chief of such action
and of the location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor
vehicle, including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. §
4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Police chief as a result of the
performance of the Police Chief’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when
such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered
into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle
within a period of time specified by the Police Chief. If the Police Chief
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the Police Chief shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Police Chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the Police Chief issues an order under division (a) of this section
and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by a towing service, the towing
service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated by the
Police Chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed.
   (c)   (1)   The Police Chief shall cause a search to be made of the records
of an applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into
storage by the Police Chief within five business days of the removal of the
vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Police Chief shall send or cause to
be sent to the owner and any lienholder at the owner’s and any lienholder’s
last known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested,
by certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner and any lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and
presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a certificate of
title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Police Chief to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be
disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in
R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police
Chief shall execute in triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar
of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief’s records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle under division (e)(1) of this section, in order to obtain release of
the motor vehicle. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

the private tow-away zone, the owner shall include on the sign the address of
the property on which the private tow-away zone is located or the name of the
business that is located on the property designated as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,

            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;

as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (i)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the property or in violation of any posted
parking condition or regulation, the owner may cause the removal of the vehicle
by a towing service. The towing service shall remove the vehicle in accordance

vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and storage of the
vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established under division (i)
(7) of this section, and to the right of a towing service to obtain title to
the vehicle if it remains unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner

         B.   If the municipality requires tow trucks and tow truck operators
to be licensed, no owner of private property located within the municipality
shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle pursuant to division (i)(2)
of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or unlicensed tow truck operator.

authority of division (i)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle

the vehicle. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall
move the vehicle so that the vehicle is not parked on the private property
established as a private tow-away zone without the consent of the owner or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   1.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (i)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (i)(1) of this section.
            2.   The towing service shall record the time and date of the
photographs taken under division (i) of this section. The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this division:

of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
         (R.C. § 2901.13)
606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

606.09 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11 ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13 SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.

608.04 FAILURE TO REPORT A CRIME OR DEATH.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in division (a)(2) of this section, no
person, knowing that a felony has been or is being committed, shall knowingly
fail to report the information to law enforcement authorities.
      (2)   No person, knowing that a violation of R.C. § 2913.04(B) has been
or is being committed or that the person has received information derived from

wound treated or observed by the person, or any serious physical harm to
persons that the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from
an offense of violence.
   (c)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (d)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or
her knowledge that may have a bearing on the investigation of the death.
   (e)   (1)   As used in this section, “burn injury” means any of the
following:

         B.   Any burns to the upper respiratory tract or laryngeal edema due

who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a
violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury
immediately to the local arson bureau, if there is such a bureau in the
jurisdiction in which the person is attended or treated, or otherwise to local
law enforcement authorities.
      (3)   No manager, superintendent, or other person in charge of a
hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility in which a person is attended
or treated for any burn injury inflicted by an explosion or other incendiary
device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a violent,
malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury immediately
to the local arson bureau, if there is such a bureau in the jurisdiction in
which the person is attended or treated, or otherwise to local law enforcement
authorities.

with the office of the State Fire Marshal. The report shall be made on a form
provided by the State Fire Marshal.
      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.
   (f)   (1)   No person who knows that a licensed medical professional has
committed an offense under R.C. Chapter 2907, a violation of a municipal
ordinance that is substantially equivalent to such offense, or a substantially
equivalent criminal offense in another jurisdiction, against a patient of the
licensed medical professional shall fail to report such knowledge to law
enforcement authorities within 30 days of obtaining the knowledge.
      (2)   Except for a self-report or participation in the offense or
violation being reported, any person who makes a report within the 30-day
period provided in division (f)(1) of this section or any person who
participates in a judicial proceeding that results from such report is immune
from civil or criminal liability that otherwise might be incurred or imposed as
a result of making that report or participating in that proceeding so long as
the person is acting in good faith without fraud or malice.
      (3)   The physician-patient relationship or physician assistant-patient
relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding the person’s
knowledge of a licensed medical professional’s commission of an offense or
violation reported under division (f)(1) of this section, against that licensed
medical professional in any judicial proceeding resulting from a report made
under that division.
      (4)   As used in division (f) of this section, “licensed medical
professional” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2907.01.
   (g)   (1)   Any doctor of medicine or osteopathic medicine, hospital intern
or resident, nurse, psychologist, social worker, independent social worker,
social work assistant, licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed
professional counselor, independent marriage and family therapist, or marriage
and family therapist who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
patient or client has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege
or advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground
for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (g)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.
   (h)   Division (a) or (d) of this section does not require disclosure of
information, when any of the following applies:
      (1)   The information is privileged by reason of the relationship between
attorney and client; physician and patient; advanced practice registered nurse
and patient; licensed psychologist or licensed school psychologist and client;
licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed professional counselor,
independent social worker, social worker, independent marriage and family
therapist, or marriage and family therapist and client; member of the clergy,
rabbi, minister, or priest and any person communicating information
confidentially to the member of the clergy, rabbi, minister, or priest for a
religious counseling purpose of a professional character; husband and wife; or
a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to that member of the clergy in that member’s capacity as a
member of the clergy by a person seeking the aid or counsel of that member of
the clergy.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program of treatment or services for persons with drug dependencies or persons
in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. §
5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide
program for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are
violations of R.C. § 2907.02 or R.C. § 2907.05 or to victims of felonious
sexual penetration in violation of former R.C. § 2907.12. As used in this
division, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide

initial certificate was obtained. If a certificate holder relocates to a new
county, the certificate holder shall follow the procedure in division (j)(3)B.
of this section and, upon the expiration of the certificate issued in the
original county, shall renew the certificate in the new county.
      (3)   A.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration
certificate has previously been obtained relocates to a new address within the
same county, the owner shall provide notice of the new address to the County
Auditor within ten days of relocating to the new address.

   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and
Section 618.17 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog,
and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply
with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As
part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to
obtain the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount
described in division (o)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.

report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

672.03 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

672.04 DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of
Section
672.01 or Section
672.02 is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law if the property
involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies
the account on which it is to be drawn, and that has not been executed by the
drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.22, a temporary motor vehicle license registration as prescribed by R.C. §
4503.182, or any comparable temporary motor vehicle license registration as
prescribed by the applicable law of another state or the United States;
   (d)   A blank form for a certificate of title or a manufacturer’s or
importer’s certificate to a motor vehicle, as prescribed by Ohio R.C. 4505.07;
   (e)   A blank form for any license listed in Ohio R.C. 4507.01.
(ORC 2913.71)
672.045 EVIDENCE OF THEFT OF RENTED PROPERTY.
   (a)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   "Renter." A person who owns rented property.
      (2)   "Rentee." A person who pays consideration to a renter for the use
of rented property.
   (b)   Each of the following shall be considered evidence of intent to commit
theft of rented property or rental services:
      (1)   At the time of entering into the rental contract, the rentee
presented the renter with identification that was materially false, fictitious,
or not current with respect to name, address, place of employment, or other
relevant information.
      (2)   After receiving a notice demanding the return of the rented
property as provided in division (c) of this section, the rentee neither
returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee’s agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.
(ORC 2913.72)

698.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially similar to a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of th operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring

         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under § 698.02(c), (d), (e), and
(f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under § 698.02(b) only
upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders
whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate
that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender
from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in the Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other
provision of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is
substantially similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is
permitted or required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to
any other penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or
commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for
the period of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of
suspension imposed for the violation of the provision of this Code of
Ordinances shall not exceed the period of suspension that is permitted or
required to be imposed for the violation of the provision of the Revised Code
to which the provision of this Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

representatives and telephone line capacity to ensure that telephone calls to
service/repair and billing inquiry lines are answered by a customer service
representative within thirty seconds, and that any transfers are made within
thirty seconds. These standards shall be met no less than ninety percent of the
time, measured quarterly.
   (c)   Responsiveness.
      (1)   Guaranteed seven-day residential installation.
         A.   The cable operator shall complete all standard customer
installations requested by customers within seven business days after the order
is placed, unless a later date for installation is requested. Standard customer
installations are those located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution
system. If the customer requests a nonstandard customer installation, or the
cable operator determines that a nonstandard customer installation is required,
the cable operator shall provide the customer, in advance, with a total
installation cost estimate and an estimated date of completion.
         B.   All underground cable drops from the pedestal to the home shall
be buried at a depth of no less than eight inches, and within no more than two

appointment, except for appointments scheduled within twelve hours after the
initial call.
         B.   An operator may not cancel an appointment with a customer after
the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment.
         C.   If a cable operator representative is running late for an
appointment with a customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as
scheduled, the customer will be contacted and notified as soon as it is
apparent that the appointment will be missed. The appointment will be
rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the customer.
         D.   The cable operator shall be deemed to have responded to a request
for service under the provisions of this section when a technician arrives
within the agreed upon time and, if the customer is absent when the technician
arrives, the technician leaves written notification of arrival and return time,
and a copy of such notification is kept by the cable operator. In such
circumstances, the cable operator shall attempt to contact the customer within
forty-eight hours.
      (3)   Residential service interruptions.
         A.   In the event of system outages (loss of reception on all
channels) resulting from cable operator equipment failure affecting three or
more customers, the cable operator shall respond to such failure within two
hours after the third customer call is received.

cause and for the shortest time possible. Scheduled interruptions shall be
preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system,
preferably between 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. of the following day.
         B.   If a customer experiences poor video or audio reception
attributable to the cable operator's equipment, the cable operator shall repair
the problem no later than the day following the customer call. If an
appointment is necessary, the customer may choose the same blocks of time
described in paragraph (c)(2)A. hereof. At the customer's request, the cable
operator shall repair the problem at a later time convenient to the customer.
      (5)   Treatment of property.
         A.   The cable operator shall keep trimming to a minimum. Trees and
shrubs or other landscaping that are damaged by the cable operator, an employee
or agent during installation or construction shall be restored to their prior
condition or replaced. Trees and shrubs shall not be removed without the prior
permission of the owner or legal tenant of the property on which they are

upon private premises, and the notice shall specify the work to be performed,
provided that in the case of construction operations, such notice shall be
delivered or provided at least twenty-four hours prior to entry. Nothing herein
shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private property, or any
other property, where such right to access or entry is not otherwise provided
by law. If damage is caused by any cable operator activity, the cable operator
shall reimburse the property owner 100 percent of the cost of the damage or
replace the damaged property. For the installation of pedestals or other major
construction or installation projects, property owners shall also be notified
by mail at least one week in advance. In the case of an emergency, the cable
operator shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal tenant in person,
and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event that personal contact is not
made.

      (2)   The cable operator shall provide customers with written
notification of any change in rates, programming or channel positions, at least
thirty days before the effective date of such change.
      (3)   Each customer service representative, technician or employee of the
cable operator, in each contact with a customer, shall state the estimated cost
of the service, repair or installation orally prior to delivery of the service
or before any work is performed, and shall provide the customer with an oral
statement of the total charges before terminating the telephone call or before
leaving the location at which the work was performed.
   (e)   Customer Privacy.
      (1)   The cable operator shall not monitor cable television signals to
determine the individual viewing patterns or practices of any customer without
prior written consent from that customer, except as otherwise permitted by the
franchise or applicable law.
      (2)   The cable operator shall not sell or otherwise make available
customer lists or other personally identifiable customer information without
prior written customer consent, except as otherwise permitted by the franchise
or applicable law. The cable operator is permitted to disclose such information
if such disclosure is necessary to render or conduct a legitimate business
activity related to a cable service or other service provided by the cable
operator to its customers.
   (f)   Billing.
      (1)   Bills will be clear, concise and understandable. Bills must be
fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic and

delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges,
rebates and credits.
      (2)   In case of a billing dispute, the cable operator must respond to a
written complaint from a subscriber within thirty days.
      (3)   Refund checks will be issued promptly, but no later than either:
         A.   The customer's next billing cycle following resolution of the
request or thirty days, whichever is earlier, or
         B.   The return of the equipment supplied by the cable operator if
service is terminated.
      (4)   Credits for service will be issued no later than the customer's
next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted.
   (g)   Complaint Procedures.
      (1)   Any verbal, telephonic or written complaint relating to the quality
or continuity of service shall be attended to within a normal service interval.
In the event that such complaints are not responded to or service is not
restored to the levels required by the FCC or by the terms of this chapter
during said normal service interval, the subscriber shall be entitled to a
rebate of his or her monthly service charge or twenty dollars ($20.00),
whichever is greater, for the missed appointment. This provision shall not
apply if such delay is occasioned because of an act of God, a strike, a
national emergency or any other circumstance beyond the control of the cable
operator. Similarly, this provision shall not apply to service requests or
complaints pertaining to television set malfunction or any other breakdown not
related to the operation of the cable television system. The Village Complaint
Officer, provided for in paragraph (g)(3) hereof, shall be responsible for
invoking said penalty upon receiving a written subscriber complaint. The
Complaint Officer shall hold a hearing on such complaint, to be conducted in
the manner prescribed in and otherwise governed by paragraph (g)(3) hereof.
      (2)   The cable operator shall establish procedures for receiving, acting
upon and resolving subscriber complaints. The cable operator shall furnish a
notice of such procedures to each subscriber at the time of initial
subscription to the system. In addition, the cable operator shall maintain a
written record, printout or log, listing dates and times of customer
complaints, identifying the subscriber and describing the nature of the
complaints and when and what action was taken by the cable operator in response
thereto. Such records shall be kept for a period of three years at the cable
operator's local office, reflecting the operations to date, subject to
applicable laws regarding subscriber privacy, and shall be available for
inspection during regular business hours.
      (3)   The Mayor or a designee shall serve as the Village Complaint
Officer, with primary responsibility for the continuing administration of
complaint procedures hereunder. Any subscriber, user, programmer or other
interested person who has a complaint regarding the quality of cable television
service, equipment malfunctions, billings or any other matter, which remains
unresolved for thirty days after it has been brought to the cable operator's
attention, may file a complaint, in writing, with the Complaint Officer. Upon
the filing of such a complaint, said Complaint Officer shall notify the cable
operator and make an investigation to determine whether or not there is
probable cause to credit the allegations. If the Complaint Officer determines
after such investigation that there is probable cause to credit the allegations
of the complaint, the Complaint Officer shall notify the cable operator and the
complainant and promptly endeavor to resolve the matter by conciliation and
persuasion. In the event that the Complaint Officer is unable to obtain
conciliation within a reasonable time, the matter shall be promptly set for a
hearing where all parties may give evidence and the merits of the dispute will
be decided. The Complaint Officer shall make the decision public, along with a
statement reciting the basis therefor. Within thirty days thereafter, either
the cable operator or the complainant may appeal to the Council, in writing,
the decision rendered by the Complaint Officer. At the appeal hearing, the
aggrieved party may contest the findings of fact or interpretation of
controlling law, at which time the Council may affirm, reject or modify the
decision of the Complaint Officer. The affirmance, rejection or modification of
said decision by the Council shall be final.
       (4)   Where there have been similar complaints made, or when there
exists other evidence which, in the judgment of the Complaint Officer, casts
doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service, the Complaint Officer
shall have the right and authority to compel the cable operator to test,
analyze and report on the performance of the system. Such report shall be
delivered to the Complaint Officer no later than fourteen days after said
Officer formally notifies the cable operator and shall include the following
information: the nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests,
what system component(s) were tested; the equipment used; procedures employed
in resolving said complaints, if applicable; and any and all additional
information deemed relevant by the Complaint Officer.
       (5)   Said tests and analyses shall be supervised by a registered
professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the cable operator and
selected by the Village. The aforesaid engineer shall sign all records of
special tests and forward to the Complaint Officer such records with a report
interpreting the results of the tests and recommending action to be taken by
the Village.
       (6)   The cable operator shall notify each subscriber at the time of
initial installation of the name and address of the Village Complaint Officer
and of the procedures contained in this section.
(Ord 1997-40. Passed 4-9-97.)
806.04 CUSTOMER DISSATISFACTION WITH ANY SERVICE. 
    Any customer who requests disconnection of cable service or of any
particular programming service previously ordered shall have disconnection
effective on the day such request is made. The customer will not be charged
thereafter for any service disconnected and, in the case of a service for which
the customer has prepaid, the customer shall promptly be provided a credit for,
or sent a refund of, the unused portion of the prepaid amount.
(Ord. 1997-40. Passed 4-9-97.)
806.05 SAFETY. 
    The cable operator shall install and locate its facilities, cable system
and equipment in compliance with all Federal, State, local and company safety
standards, and in such manner as shall not unduly interfere with or endanger
persons or property. Whenever the cable operator receives notice that an unsafe
condition exists with respect to its equipment, the cable operator shall
investigate such condition immediately and shall take such measures as are
necessary to remove or eliminate such unsafe condition.
(Ord. 1997-40. Passed 4-9-97.)
806.99 PENALTY. 
    If, after conducting the hearing and appeal procedure provided in Section
806.03(g)(3), the cable operator is determined to be in violation of the terms
of these Customer Service Standards, the cable operator shall be subject to the
penalties set forth in Section 17 of the franchise agreement.

COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all
applicable Federal and State laws.
   (b)   In the event that the State or Federal government discontinues
preemption in any area of cable communications over which it currently
exercises jurisdiction in such manner as to expand rather than limit municipal
regulatory authority, the grantor may, if it so elects, adopt rules and
regulations in these areas to the extent permitted by law. The grantor shall
notify the grantees of its intent to adopt rules and regulations in writing at
least thirty days prior to the adoption of the rules and regulations.
   (c)   This chapter shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after
the effective date of this chapter.

or any other legally constituted governmental unit having lawful jurisdiction
over the subject matter hereof.

808.08 TRANSFERS OF FRANCHISES.
   (a)   The grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose
of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary
sale, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise and/or the cable system or any
of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the prior consent
of the Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed and
shall be denied only upon a good faith finding by the Village that the proposed
transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial qualifications to perform
its obligations under the franchise agreement, and then only upon such
reasonable terms and conditions as the grantor may require. Any attempt to
sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or otherwise dispose of the franchise
and/or the cable system without the consent of the Council shall be null and
void. This provision shall not apply to sales of property or equipment in the
normal course of business. No consent from the Village shall be required for a
transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of hypothecation, in whole or
in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro forma transfer to a
corporation, partnership or other entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with the grantee.
   (b)   The following events shall be deemed to be a sale, assignment or other
transfer of the franchise and/or the cable system requiring compliance with
this section:
      (1)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a majority of the
grantee's assets;
      (2)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interests in the grantee by one or more
of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity owners so as to
create a new controlling interest in the grantee;
      (3)   The issuance of additional capital stock or partnership, membership
or other equity interest by the grantee so as to create a new controlling
interest in the grantee; and
      (4)   The entry by the grantee into an agreement with respect to the
management or operation of the grantee and/or the system.
   The term "controlling interest" as used herein means majority equity
ownership of the grantee.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided below, or unless waived by the grantor as
provided under Section
808.34, no grantee may sell or otherwise transfer ownership in a franchise and/
or a cable system prior to the substantial completion of the initial design or
initial construction of said system by the grantee. In the case of a sale of
multiple systems, if the terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently
transfer ownership of one or more such systems to one or more third parties,
such transfer shall be considered a part of the initial transaction. The above-
described holding period shall not apply to:
      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise and/or cable
system which is not subject to Federal income tax liability;
      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of any agency,
any State or political subdivision or the Village; or
      (3)   Any sale, assignment or transfer to one or more purchasers,
assignees or transferees controlling, controlled by or under common control
with the seller, assignor or transferor or its affiliate.
   (d)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any franchise and/
or cable system, the Village shall have 120 days to act upon any request for
approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such
information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications Commission
regulations, the requirements of this chapter and such other reasonable
information as the Village, in its sole discretion, may request. During the
review period, the grantor may advise the grantee that a public hearing is
deemed necessary to evaluate any potential adverse effect of the sale or
transfer upon the grantee's subscribers. In such event, the grantee shall
receive written notice of the hearing and of the opportunity to participate
fully in it, as far in advance as possible, but in no event less than fourteen
days prior to the start of the hearing. If the Village fails to render a final
decision on the request within 120 days from receipt by the Village of all
required information, such request shall be deemed granted, unless the
requesting party and the Village agree to an extension of time. Such request to
transfer may be conditioned upon the performance of additional requirements
imposed upon the grantee by the grantor, and the payment of a nonrefundable
transfer fee of five thousand dollars ($5,000).
   (e)   The grantee shall notify the grantor in writing of any foreclosure or
any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property
of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or
a substantial part of said franchise property. Such notification shall be
considered by the grantor as notice that a change in control or ownership of
the franchise has taken place, and the provisions of this section governing the
consent of the grantor to such change in control or ownership shall apply.
   (f)   For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such
change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor may inquire into the
qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and the
grantee shall assist the grantor in any such inquiry. In seeking the grantor's
consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee shall have the
responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes an application in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the grantor, which application shall
include the information required under State and Federal law as well as under
Section
808.13(b). An application, acceptable to the Village, shall be submitted to the
grantor not less than ninety days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee
shall be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and
financial qualifications to operate and maintain the system and to comply with
all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If,
after considering the legal, technical and financial qualifications and the
character of the applicant and determining that they are satisfactory, the
grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, the grantor shall transfer and
assign the rights and obligations of such franchise. The consent of the grantor
to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied.
   (g)   The consent or approval of the grantor to transfer by the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the grantor in or to
its public rights-of-way or easements, and any transfer shall by its own terms
be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement. A sale, transfer or assignment of the franchise may not be
approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory to the
franchise agreement.
   (h)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or its assets
for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the
franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its designee
satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the cable
television system in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations. Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for
such operation within thirty days of assuming such control, which plan will
insure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during
the term that the financial institution exercises control over the system. The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period
exceeding one year, unless extended by the grantor in its discretion, and
during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to
transfer the franchise to another grantee.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.09 PURCHASE BY VILLAGE.
   (a)   The grantor may, at any time, offer to purchase the grantee's cable
system for the same consideration and according to the same terms that it is
willing to accept from any person. The grantee shall have thirty days from
receipt of the offer from the grantor within which to accept the offer.
   (b)   In any case where the grantor elects to purchase the system, the
purchase shall be closed within sixty days of the date of the grantor's audit
of a current profit and loss statement of the grantee.

system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit, school, library and
Municipal building in the service area, subject to any line extension
requirements of the franchise agreement.
   (b)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any part of the service area, the grantee shall provide
cable service to any non-commercial subscriber requesting a standard
installation within that part of the service area within seven days from the
date of request if no further construction is required, or within thirty days
if construction is required, provided that the grantee is able to secure all
rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber on reasonable
terms and conditions within such thirty-day period. For purposes of this
section, a request shall be deemed made on the date of signing a service
agreement, receipt of funds by the grantee, receipt of a written request by the
grantee or receipt by the grantee of a verified verbal request.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, the grantee
shall provide such service:
      (1)   With no line extension charge, except as specifically authorized in
the franchise agreement.
      (2)   At a non-discriminatory installation charge for a standard
installation, with additional charges for non-standard installations computed
according to a non-discriminatory methodology for such installations, as
adopted by the grantee.
      (3)   At non-discriminatory monthly rates for residential subscribers.
   The grantee may establish different and non-discriminatory rates and charges
of services for commercial subscribers, as well as different, non-
discriminatory monthly rates for classes of commercial subscribers, upon
written notice to the grantor.
     (d)   The grantee shall be required, in accordance with this chapter and
applicable law, to provide service to individual units of a multiple dwelling
unit or "MDU" with all services offered to other dwelling units within the
franchise area, so long as the owner of the MDU consents in writing, if
requested by the grantee, to the following:
      (1)   The grantee's providing of service to individual units of the MDU;
      (2)   Reasonable conditions and times of installation, maintenance and
inspection of the cable system on the MDU premises;
      (3)   Reasonable conditions promulgated by the grantee to protect the
grantee's equipment and to encourage widespread use of the cable system; and
      (4)   Not to demand payment from the grantee for permitting the grantee
to provide service to the MDU and not to discriminate in rental charges, or
otherwise, between tenants who receive cable service and those who do not.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.11 FRANCHISES TO BE NONEXCLUSIVE.
   Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically
reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a
cable television system or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate,

franchise shall be granted on terms materially less burdensome or more
favorable than any other franchise granted hereunder.

consistent with applicable law.
   (c)   The grantor may require that any new grantee be responsible for its
own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in the
grantor's opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and
reasonably accommodate additional cables.
   (d)   Any additional franchise granted by the Village to provide cable
service in a part of the Village in which a franchise has already been granted,
and where an existing grantee is providing service, shall require the new
grantee to provide service throughout its service area within a reasonable time
and in a sequence which does not discriminate against lower income residents.

808.18 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (a)   Following the issuance and acceptance of a franchise, and as
compensation for the benefits and privileges granted under the franchise, and
in consideration of permission to use the grantor's street and rights-of-way,
the grantee shall pay to the grantor a franchise fee based upon the grantee's
annual gross revenues in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement.
   (b)   The grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished with a statement
within 120 days of the close of the calendar year, certified by an officer of
the grantee or audited by a certified public accountant, reflecting and
attesting to the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all payments and
computations for the previous calendar year. At any time and upon thirty days
prior written notice, and no more than once per calendar year, the grantor
shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of the grantee's records,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and if such audit
indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or more, the grantee
shall assume all reasonable costs of such an audit.
   (c)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by

any claim the grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this chapter or any franchise agreement or for the
performance of any other obligation of the grantee.
   (d)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is

due date, the grantee shall be assessed an additional amount, with regard to
the payment, of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day. The grantee's liability
for such amount in such cases shall not be subject to, but shall be in addition
to, the remedies set forth in Section
808.29 for franchise violations and may be taken from the performance bond in
accordance with Section
808.24.

the Cable Act, as the same may be amended from time to time. The grantor may
change the percentage to be set forth in the franchise agreement by ordinance
or resolution of the grantor's Council and upon written notice to the grantee,
as long as the same does not exceed the maximum amount the grantor is
authorized to collect as allowed by law at the time of the change and as long
as the grantor collects the same percentage from all other cable operators
operating a cable television system in the franchise area. The grantee shall
implement the change within sixty days of written notice of the same by the
grantor.
   (h)   No term or condition in this chapter or the franchise agreement shall
in any way modify or affect the grantee's obligation to pay franchise fees.
Although the total sum of franchise fee payments and additional commitments set
forth elsewhere in this chapter or in the franchise agreement may total more
than the maximum allowable percentage of the grantee's gross revenues in any
twelve-month period, the grantee agrees that the additional commitments are not
franchise fees as defined under any Federal law, nor are they to be offset or
credited against any franchise fee payments due to the grantor, nor do they
represent an increase in franchise fees to be itemized as such on the
subscriber's bill.
   (i)   Payment of the franchise fee under this chapter or the franchise
agreement shall not exempt the grantee from the payment of any other license
fee, tax, levy, assessment or charge on the business, occupation, services,
property or income of the grantee which is or may hereafter be lawfully imposed
on all entities engaged in the same business as the grantee.

808.19 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS; STREET AND OTHER PUBLIC
IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Construction.
      (1)   Subject to applicable laws, regulations and ordinances of the
grantor and the provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter, the
grantee may perform all construction necessary for the operation of its cable
system. All construction and maintenance of any and all facilities within
streets incident to the grantee's cable system shall, regardless of who
performs the construction, be and remain the grantee's responsibility. The
grantee shall apply for, and obtain, all generally applicable permits necessary
for construction or installation of any facilities, and for excavating and
laying any facilities, within the streets. The grantee shall pay all applicable
fees upon the issuance of the requisite construction permits by the grantor to
the grantee.
       (2)   Prior to beginning any construction, the grantee shall provide the
grantor with a construction schedule for work in the streets. When the
grantee's construction of facilities in the streets is completed, the grantee
shall provide the grantor with a map showing the location of the installed
facility in the streets, as built, in detail, excluding proprietary
electronics. All as-builts shall be available at the grantee's local office for
inspection.
      (3)   The grantee may make excavations in streets for any facility needed
for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. Prior to doing
such work, the grantee shall apply for, and obtain, generally applicable
permits from the grantor, and give appropriate notices to any other
franchisees, licensees or permittees of the grantor, or bureaus of the grantor,
or other units of government owning or maintaining pipes, wires, conduits or
other facilities which may be affected by the proposed excavation.
      (4)   In the event that emergency repairs are necessary, the grantee
shall immediately notify the grantor of the need for such repairs. The grantee
may initiate such emergency repairs and shall apply for appropriate permits
within forty-eight hours after discovery of the emergency. The grantee shall
comply with all applicable grantor regulations relating to such excavations or
construction, including the payment of permit or license fees.
     (b)   Location of Facilities.
      (1)   Within forty-eight hours after any grantor franchisee, licensee or
permittee notifies the grantee of a proposed street excavation, the grantee
shall, at the grantee's expense:
         A.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground facilities
within the area of the proposed excavation;
         B.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities in
the area of the proposed excavation; or
         C.   Notify the excavator that the grantee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
      (2)   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the grantee's plant was cut for
whatever reason, then the grantor's franchisee, licensee or permittee shall be
required to notify the grantee and pay for the repair of the grantee's plant.
   (c)   Restoration of Streets.
      (1)   Whenever the grantee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the grantee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition. When any opening is made by the grantee in a hard surface pavement
in any street, such grantee shall promptly refill the opening and restore the
surface to a condition reasonably satisfactory to the grantor.
      (2)   If the grantee excavates the surface of any street, such grantee
shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface within the
area affected by the excavation in accordance with applicable regulations of
the Village. The grantor may, after providing notice and an opportunity to
correct to the grantee, refill and/or repave any opening made by the grantee in
the street, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the grantee. The grantor
may, after providing notice and an opportunity to correct to the grantee,
remove and/or repair any work done by the grantee which, in the determination
of the grantor, is inadequate. The cost thereof, including the costs of
inspection and supervision, shall be paid by the grantee. All excavations made
by the grantee in the streets shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention
of accidents. All of the grantee's work under the franchise agreement and this
chapter, and this section in particular, shall be done in strict compliance
with all rules, regulations and ordinances of the grantor.
   (d)   Maintenance and Workmanship.
       (1)   The grantee's cable system shall be constructed and maintained in
such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes or any other property
of the grantor, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures
or other facilities that may have been laid in the streets by, or under, the
grantor authority.
      (2)   The grantee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the grantee's signals so as to prevent injury to
the grantor's property or property belonging to any person. The grantee, at its
own expense, shall repair, renew, change and improve its facilities as listed
above in good repair and in a safe and presentable condition.
   (e)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon the grantee's acquisition of cable-
related facilities in any grantor street, or upon the addition or annexation to
the grantor of any area in which the grantee owns or operates any cable related
facility, the grantee shall, at the grantor's request, submit to the grantor a
statement describing all facilities involved, whether authorized by franchise,
permit, license or other prior right, and specifying the location of all such
facilities to the extent that the grantee has possession of such information.
Such facilities shall immediately be subject to the terms of the franchise
agreement.
   (f)   Reservation of Grantor Streets Rights. Nothing in the franchise
agreement or this chapter, shall prevent the grantor or public utilities owned,
maintained and/or operated by public entities other than the grantor from
constructing sewers; grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any street;
laying down, repairing or removing water mains; or constructing or establishing
any other public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as
practicable, so as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the use and operation of
the grantee's cable system. However, if any of the grantee's system interferes
with the construction or repair of any street or public improvement, including
construction, repair or removal of a sewer or water main, such portion of the
grantee's system shall be removed or replaced in the manner the grantor shall
reasonably direct, and the grantor shall in no event be liable for any damage
to any portion of grantee's cable system. Any and all such removal or
replacement shall be at the expense of the grantee. Should the grantee fail to
remove, adjust or relocate its facilities by the date established by the
grantor's written notice to the grantee, the grantor may effect such removal,
adjustment or relocation, and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by
the grantee, including all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
grantor due to the grantee's delay.
   (g)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the grantee
is vacated by the grantor during the term of the franchise, then unless the
grantor specifically reserves to the grantee the right to continue its
installation in the vacated street, the grantee shall, without delay or expense
to the grantor, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities in such street,
restore, repair or reconstruct the street where removal has occurred, and
replace the street to the condition in which it was found. In the event of
failure, neglect or refusal of the grantee, after a time period to be
negotiated by the grantor and grantee, to restore, repair or reconstruct such
street, the grantor may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost
thereof may be collected by the grantor from the performance bond pursuant to
Section
808.24(c).
   (h)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever the grantee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the grantee shall submit for
the grantor's approval a complete description of the facility and the date on
which the grantee intends to discontinue using the facility. The grantee may
remove the facility or request that the grantor permit it to remain in place.
Notwithstanding the grantee's request that any such facility remain in place,
the grantor may require the grantee to remove the facility from above the
street or modify the facility to protect the public health, welfare, safety and
convenience, or otherwise serve the public interest. The grantor may require
the grantee to perform a combination of modification and removal of any such
above-ground facility. The grantee shall complete such removal or modification
in accordance with a schedule set by the grantor. Until such time as the
grantee removes or modifies the facility as directed by the grantor, or until
the rights to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility, the grantee
shall be responsible for all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility,
as well as maintenance of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the
facility were in active use, and the grantee shall retain all liability for
such facility.
   (i)   Hazardous Substances.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable State and Federal
laws, statutes, regulations, the National Electrical Safety Code, and orders
concerning hazardous substances, relating to the grantee's cable system in the
streets.
      (2)   The grantee shall maintain and inspect its cable system located in
the streets. Upon reasonable notice to the grantee, the grantor may inspect the
grantee's facilities in the streets to determine if any release of hazardous
substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the grantee's cable
system. In removing or modifying the grantee's facilities as provided in the
franchise agreement or this chapter, the grantee shall also remove all residue
of hazardous substances related thereto.
      (3)   The grantee agrees to forever indemnify the grantor against any
claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, whether direct or indirect, incurred
by the grantor arising out of release of hazardous substances caused by the
grantee's cable system in the streets.
   (j)   Undergrounding of Cable. Existing facilities of the grantee's and
existing portions of the grantee's cable system shall be placed underground at
the grantee's expense when other utilities in the same rights-of-way place
their facilities underground or when required of all utilities and persons by
general ordinances of the grantor or applicable State or Federal law.
   (k)   Construction Codes. The grantee shall strictly adhere to all building
and zoning codes currently or hereafter in effect. The grantee shall arrange
its lines, cables and other appurtenances, on both public and private property,
in such a manner as to cause no unreasonable interference with the use of said
public or private property by any person. In the event of such interference,
the grantor may require the removal or relocation of the grantee's lines,
cables and other appurtenances from the property in question.
   (l)   Construction and Use of Poles.
      (1)   Whenever feasible, the construction, maintenance and use of the
grantee's cable system shall comply with the standards of materials in
engineering and all other provisions of a pole user agreement for use of poles,
entered into by and between other pole users and the grantee. In the event that
the grantee cannot obtain the necessary poles and allied facilities pursuant to
the provisions of such an agreement, and only in such event, then it shall be
lawful for the grantee to make all needed excavations in the streets for the
purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the grantee's cable system. All
poles of the grantee shall be erected between the curb and the sidewalk, unless
otherwise designated by the proper grantor authorities, and each pole shall be
set whenever practicable at an extension lot line. The grantor shall have the
right to require the grantee to change the location of any grantee-owned pole,
conduit, structure or other facility within the streets when, in the opinion of
the grantor, the public convenience requires such change, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the grantee.
      (2)   Nothing herein shall exempt the grantee from compliance with all
Charter and ordinance provisions relating to such excavations or construction,
or with any provision requiring payment of permit or license fees pertaining
thereto.
   (m)   System Design. The grantee's cable system shall comply with the design
and service requirements and schedules to be contained in the franchise
agreement, the exhibits attached to the franchise agreement and all applicable
laws and regulations. All of the grantee's construction and design shall be
subject to the grantor's supervision and control, including, without
limitation, the location of facilities, the placement of poles and the decision
to underground any facilities. The grantee shall submit construction drawings
and specifications for approval on all projects.
   (n)   Geographical Coverage. The grantee shall design and construct its
cable system in such manner as to have the capability to connect and provide
cable service to every single-family dwelling unit, multiple-family dwelling
unit, school, library and Municipal agency within the franchise area, provided
that any other cable provider should be required to do the same.
   (o)   System Upgrade Schedule.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with the requirements of the system
upgrade schedule to be contained in an exhibit of the franchise agreement.
      (2)   No less than thirty days prior to the start of construction in the
franchise area, the grantee shall meet all applicable design and construction
standards of the grantor and shall provide a detailed construction progress
schedule and area construction maps. In addition, the grantee shall update this
information upon request by the grantor on a quarterly basis, by submitting a
copy of its normal internal progress reports, showing specifically whether
schedules are being met and the reasons for any delay.
   (p)   Installation of New Cable System Underground. All new or upgrade cable
system facilities shall be installed underground where existing undergrounded
utility facilities exist, but may be installed on existing utility poles where
aerial facilities currently exist. In areas where no poles exist, the grantee
shall place its facilities underground, and the grantee shall move existing
facilities underground whenever all other utilities go underground.
   (q)   Prewiring. Any law of the grantor which requires prewiring of
subdivisions or other developments for electrical and telephone service shall
be construed to include wiring for cable systems.
   (r)   Undergrounding of Multiple-Dwelling Units. In cases of single-site
multiple- dwelling units, the grantee shall minimize the number of individual
aerial drop cables by installing multiple drop cables underground between the
pole and the dwelling unit where such installation is determined to be
technologically and economically feasible, in agreement with the owners and/or
an owner's association of the multiple-dwelling units. This section shall apply
only to newly constructed buildings or unwired existing buildings. The grantee
shall be required to install drop cables underground only if all other
utilities are required to do the same at the time of installation.
   (s)   Rights-of-Way Occupancy.
      (1)   In any case where the grantee has the required written permission
from the grantor not to underground its cable system facilities, the grantee
shall utilize existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever possible
and economically feasible, and may not construct or install any new, different
or additional poles, conduits or other facilities on public property until the
written approval of the grantor is obtained.
      (2)   The grantee shall:
         A.   Locate and install all transmission lines, equipment and
structures so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable
convenience of property owners. However, the grantee shall retain the right to
determine, because of technical feasibility and technical reliability, where,
when, how and if equipment originally installed needs to be redesigned,
reconfigured or relocated;
         B.   Keep and maintain all transmission lines, equipment and
structures in a safe, adequate and substantial condition, and in good order and
repair;
         C.   Employ professional care and install and maintain methods and
devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage,
injuries or nuisances to the public;
         D.   Use suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices
as necessary for the safety of all members of the public;
         E.   Place any poles or other fixtures in any public right-of-way in
such manner as not to interfere with the usual travel of the right-of-way or
cause unsafe conditions of any sort; and
         F.   Comply with all local and State laws, rules and regulations
pertaining to traffic control.
      (3)   The grantee may not make paving cuts or curb cuts unless absolutely
necessary, and only after written permission and a street cut permit have been
obtained from the grantor, under such conditions as the grantor shall in its
reasonable discretion determine.
      (4)   The grantor may reasonably require conduit for underground cable in
areas specified by the grantor, said conduit to be provided at the grantee's
sole expense.
      (5)   Before beginning any excavation or other construction activity on a
public right-of-way or easement which crosses or abuts any private property,
the grantee shall clearly mark and delineate, with flags, stakes or non-
polluting water-soluble spray paint, the boundaries of that public right-of-way
or easement where it abuts or crosses the private property.
      (6)   In case of disturbance of any street, sidewalk, alley, easement,
public way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property, the
grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the
grantor, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, easement, public
way, grassed or paved area or any other public or private property to as good a
condition as it was, or a better condition than it was, before the work causing
such disturbance was performed.
      (7)   The grantee shall locate, mark and map any of its installed cable
or the cable system for the grantor at no expense to the grantor. The cable
shall be installed so that it can be detected by the use of standard locating
devices.
    (t)   Completion of Work by Grantor. Upon the failure of the grantee to
commence, pursue or complete any work required by law, by the provisions of the
franchise agreement or this chapter (other than completion of construction or
rebuilding of the cable system, which shall be governed by Section
808.29) or by any applicable permit, to be done in any public right-of-way or
public utilities easement, within the time prescribed and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the grantor, the grantor may, after notice to the grantee and
an opportunity to cure, cause the work to be done. The grantee shall pay to the
grantor the reasonable costs of the work in the itemized amount reported by the
grantor to the grantee, within thirty days after receipt of the itemized
report.
   (u)   Removal of Facilities. Upon receipt of written notice, the grantee, at
its own expense, shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove any of its property as necessary because of traffic conditions, public
safety, street vacation, grade, separation or realignment or installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, transportation
facilities, tracks or any other type of structure or improvement.
   Nothing described in this subsection shall be considered a taking of the
property of the grantee, and the grantee is not entitled to additional
compensation because of these actions.
   The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving
permit issued by the grantor, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit
the moving of the building or buildings. The grantee may require reasonable
advance payment from any such permittee prior to raising or lowering its wires.
   (v)   Stop Work.
      (1)   On notice from the grantor that any work is being prosecuted
contrary to the provisions of the franchise agreement or this chapter, or in an
unsafe or dangerous manner as determined by the grantor, or in violation of the
terms of any applicable permit, laws, regulations, ordinances or standards, the
work may immediately be stopped by the grantor.
      (2)   The stop-work order shall be:
         A.   In writing;
         B.   Given to the individual doing the work, or posted on the work
site; and
         C.   Sent to the grantee by overnight delivery at the address given in
the franchise agreement.
         Further, such stop-work order may:
         D.   Indicate the nature of the alleged violation or unsafe condition;
and
         E.   Establish conditions under which work may be resumed.
   (w)   Grantee's Contractors. The grantee's contractors shall be licensed and
bonded in accordance with the grantor's ordinances and regulations and the
requirements of all contractors working in the public rights-of-way. Any action
or omission of a contractor of the grantee which violates any provision of the
franchise agreement shall be considered an action or omission of the grantee
for the purposes of this chapter.
   (x)   Private Property. Except in the case of an emergency involving public
safety or service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the grantee
shall give reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to
entering upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to
be performed, provided that in the case of construction operations, such notice
shall be delivered or provided, when possible, prior to entry. If any damage is
caused by any grantee activity or omission, the grantee shall reimburse the
property owner the reasonable cost of the damage or replace or repair the
damaged property. For installation of pedestals or other major construction or
installation projects, property owners shall also be notified by mail at least
one week in advance. In the case of an emergency (as defined above), the
grantee shall attempt to contact the property owner or legal tenant in person
and shall leave a door hanger notice in the event personal contact is not made.
Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing access or entry to private
property or any other property where such right to access or entry is not
otherwise provided by law.
   (y)   Burial Standards.
      (1)   Depths. The grantee shall comply with the following burial depth
standards, unless local ordinances or the National Electrical Code standards
require a deeper minimum depth:
         A.   Cable drops from the pedestal shall be buried at a minimum depth
of eight inches.
         B.   Feeder lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         C.   Trunk lines shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen to
twenty-four inches.
         D.   Fiber optic cable shall be buried at a minimum depth of eighteen
to twenty-four inches.
      (2)   Timeliness. Temporary cable drops installed by the grantee to
residences shall be buried according to these standards within two calendar
weeks of initial installation. When freezing surface or other adverse weather
conditions prevent the grantee from achieving such timetable, the grantee shall
apprise the subscriber of the circumstances and the estimated time of burial in
writing, and shall provide the subscriber, in writing, with the grantee's
telephone number and instructions as to how and when to call the grantee to
request burial of the line if the revised schedule is not met.
   (z)   National Standards. The grantor shall have the option of adopting any
national standards for the installation of optic fiber hereafter promulgated or
established.
   (aa)   Construction Standards.
      (1)   The grantee shall comply with all applicable grantor construction
codes, including, without limitation, the Ohio Basic Building Code, the OBOA
One, Two and Three Family Dwelling Code, the National Electrical Code, and the
Electronic Industries Association Standard for Physical Location and Protection
of Below-Ground Fiber Optic Cable Plant, zoning ordinances and permit
procedures. The grantor may charge reasonable permit fees consistent with
existing laws for upgrade construction of cable plant. To move the upgrade
construction process along, the grantor agrees to process all applications,
reviews, authorizations or consents pertaining to permits, zoning issues,
authorizations and consents in a period not to exceed thirty days from written
application or request to the grantor. If the grantor fails to do so within
said period, said request, application, authorization or consent shall be
deemed approved.
      (2)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with all
applicable sections of Federal and State Occupational Safety and Health Acts,
and any amendments thereto, as well as all State and local codes and standards,
where applicable.
      (3)   All installation of electronic equipment shall be of a permanent
nature, durable and installed in accordance with the provisions of the National
Electrical Code, as amended, and all applicable State and local codes.
      (4)   Antenna supporting structures (towers) shall be designed for proper
loading as specified in the Electronics Industries Association's R.S. 222-
A specifications, as they may be amended from time to time. Antenna supporting
structures (towers) shall be painted, lighted, erected and maintained in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration and all other applicable State and local codes or regulations.
      (5)   Neither the grantee's plant and equipment, nor any work that the
grantee performs, shall endanger or interfere in any manner beyond reasonable
requirements, given the work the grantee is performing, with the rights of any
property owner, or hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (6)   The grantee shall at all times employ professional care and shall
install and maintain in use methods and devices to prevent failures and
accidents which risk damage, injury or nuisance to the public.
   (bb)   New Residential Developments. In new residential developments in
which all the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the
following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of
underground easements:
      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all
franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire (or, pursuant to
the terms and provisions of this chapter and any franchise agreement, may be
required) to provide cable service to that development. The developer may
establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final
development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve
the development.
      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service, they shall
be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared
basis. If fewer than two operators indicate interest, the developer shall
provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate
to the Village any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be
entitled to recover the cost of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event
that the grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any
grantee.
      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days notice of the
date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed
to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall
have two working days to begin the installation of their cables and five
working days after beginning installation to complete installation.
      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until the developer
submits evidence that:
         A.   It has notified each grantee that underground utility trenches
are to open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed
access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual
homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and
         B.   It has received a written notification from each grantee that the
grantee intends to install its facilities during the open trench period on the
specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are
mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has received no reply
from a grantee within ten days after its notification to such grantee, in which
case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its
facilities during the open trench period.
      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not
possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable
television cables, with the entire cost shared among the participating cable
operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and
the cable operators, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of
deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law.
      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the trenches have
been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching or other burial
operation and associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition
which existed prior to such trenching or burial.
      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the Village
reserves the right to require clustering of pedestals with other utilities or
franchisees.
   (cc)   Street Improvements. The grantor shall give grantees no less that
forty-five days advance notice (or notice as soon as possible in cases of
emergency) of street improvements or other activity which could affect the
cable system, including, but not limited to, street or public rights-of-way
excavation; construction repair; grading; traffic conditions; installation of
sewers, drains, water pipes, power or signal lines or tracks; or vacation or
improvement of public works.
      (1)   All such public works shall be done, insofar as possible, in such a
manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and operation of the
poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the cable system.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person from liability arising out of
the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid interfering with cable system
facilities while performing the public works.
      (2)   If any equipment of the grantee shall interfere with public works,
then, upon receipt of the forty-five day notice, that part of the equipment of
the grantee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the grantee in
such manner as shall be directed by the grantor so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the grantor, and
the grantee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or replacement.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.20 TECHNICAL STANDARDS; TESTS.
   (a)   The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system
in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, ordinances, construction
standards, Federal Communications Commission technical standards and any

area, including, but not limited to, the antenna site, the head-end and
distribution system, towers, house connections, structures, poles, wire,
coaxial cable, fixtures and appurtenances, shall be installed, located,
erected, constructed, reconstructed, replaced, removed, repaired, maintained
and operated in accordance with good engineering practices, performed by
experienced maintenance and construction personnel so as not to endanger or
interfere with improvements that the Village may deem appropriate to make or to
interfere in any manner with the rights of any property owner or to
unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
   (g)   The grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing failures
and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to the
public.
   (h)   The grantee shall, at the grantee's expense, perform the following
tests on its cable system:
       (1)   All tests required by the FCC;
      (2)   All other tests as otherwise specified in this chapter or the
franchise agreement; and
      (3)   All other tests reasonably necessary to determine compliance with
technical standards adopted by the FCC at any time during the term of the
franchise.
   The grantee shall maintain written records of all results of its cable
system tests, performed by or for the grantee. Such test results shall be made
available to the grantor upon request within two weeks.
   (i)   The grantee shall submit to the grantor, upon written request, within
sixty days after the activation of the new system, a detailed test plan
describing the methods and schedules for testing the cable system on an ongoing
basis to determine compliance with the provisions of the FCC technical
standards. The tests may be witnessed by representatives of the grantor, and
written test reports shall be submitted to the grantor upon written request.
The grantee shall provide the grantor with thirty days notice of all required
FCC tests. In the event of any FCC test failures, FCC procedures shall apply.
   (j)   At any time after commencement of service to subscribers, the grantor
may require, where reasonable, additional tests, full or partial repeat tests,
different test procedures or tests involving a specific subscriber's terminal.
Requests for such additional tests will be made on the basis of complaints
received or other evidence indicating any unresolved controversy or
noncompliance, and such tests shall be limited to the particular matter in
controversy. The grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its request for such
special tests as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the grantee or the
subscriber. Failure to perform such properly requested additional tests within
thirty days shall constitute a material breach of the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.21 TRIMMING OF TREES.
   (a)   The grantee shall have the authority to trim trees, at its sole cost,
in accordance with all applicable utility, ordinance and easement restrictions,
upon and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places of the
Village, so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact
with the wires and cables of the grantee. Village representatives shall have
authority to supervise and approve all trimming of trees conducted by the
grantee.
   (b)   Except in emergencies, the grantee may not prune trees at a point
below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written notice has
been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the street in or
over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this section, emergencies exist
when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from imminent danger of
immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or occupant shall have one
week from the receipt of the grantee's notice to arrange for an outside
contractor to prune the tree at his or her own expense. If the owner or
occupant fails to do so, the grantee may prune such tree at its own expense.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.22 PROVISION OF CABLE TO PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   The grantee shall provide one free standard installation and free monthly
expanded basic service, exclusive of premium, pay-per-view and a la carte
services, to the locations to be listed in an exhibit attached to the franchise
agreement, as well as to all newly constructed public facilities, during the
term of the franchise, plus two additional public facility locations selected
by the grantor. Such sites may also receive premium and pay-per-view services
at a cost not greater than that charged to residential subscribers for the same
service.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.23 INDEMNIFICATION OF VILLAGE.
   (a)   The grantee, under any franchise operated pursuant to this chapter,
shall agree to indemnify, hold harmless, release and defend the Village, its
officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees, from and against any and
all lawsuits, claims, causes of action, actions, liability, demands, damages,
disability, losses, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs,
or liabilities of any nature, that may be asserted by any person, resulting or
in any manner arising from the action or inaction of the grantee, its
subcontractors, employees and agents, in constructing, operating, maintaining,
repairing or removing the system, in carrying on the grantee's business or
operations in the Village, or in exercising or failing to exercise any right or
privilege granted by the franchise. This indemnity shall apply, without
limitation, to any action or cause of action for invasion of privacy,
defamation, antitrust, errors and omissions, theft, fire, violation or
infringement of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent,
or any other right of any person, whether or not any act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or any franchise
agreement, but shall not include any claim or action arising out of the actions
or omissions of Village officers, employees or agents or related to any Village
programming or other access programming for which the grantee is not legally
responsible.
   (b)   The Village shall promptly notify the grantee of any claims subject to
indemnification by the grantee and shall cooperate with all reasonable requests
by the grantee for information, documents, testimony or other assistance
appropriate to a resolution of such claims. The grantee shall have full
responsibility for and control of any action or undertaking directed at the
resolution of such claims.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.24 INSURANCE; CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION BOND; PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   The grantee shall provide insurance as specified in the franchise
agreement.
    (b)   With respect to the initial construction of the cable system, or any
significant project to upgrade or rebuild more than fifty percent of the cable
system, grantee shall provide to the grantor a construction performance and
construction completion bond (herein referred to as the "construction
completion bond"), with a surety reasonably approved by the grantor's
Solicitor, in an amount equal to ten percent of the applicable estimated
construction cost. Such amount, however, shall not exceed two hundred thousand
dollars ($200,000). With respect to the initial construction of the cable
system or the upgrade or rebuild project, when regular subscriber service is
available to seventy-five percent of occupied dwelling units, the amount of the
bond shall be reduced by fifty percent of the original amount. On the one-year
anniversary of the initial construction of the cable system or the upgrade or
rebuild project, as the case may be, the bond may be canceled.
   (c)   Within sixty days of the passage of the ordinance adopting the
franchise agreement, the grantee shall deposit with the grantor a surety bond
or letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Solicitor of the grantor (hereinafter referred to
as the performance bond). The performance bond shall be available to insure the
faithful performance by the grantee of provisions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement, other than with respect to construction, upgrading or
rebuilding projects covered herein, but including the obligation to remove the
above-ground portion of the cable system upon revocation or termination of the
franchise as set forth herein. The performance bond shall be maintained at
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) during the entire term of the franchise
agreement, regardless of withdrawals which may be made under this section. In
the event of a default by the grantee in any of its obligations under the
agreement, other than completion of construction, which default is not cured
within thirty days after notice by the grantor to the grantee of such default
(or such longer time as is necessary to cure, so long as the grantee commences
to cure within thirty days and diligently pursues cure), the grantor may levy
on the performance bond upon notifying the grantee of the amount of such
charge. The grantor may also levy upon the performance bond for sums due for
penalties under Sections
808.18(e) and
808.25(g). The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the performance
bond are in addition to all other rights of the grantor, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.25 RECORDS REQUIRED AND GRANTOR'S RIGHT TO INSPECT.
   (a)   The grantee shall at all times maintain and make available to the
grantor for inspection upon written request within two weeks:
      (1)   A full, current and complete set of plans, records and "as-built"
maps showing the location of the cable television system installed or in use in
the Village, exclusive of subscriber service drops and equipment provided in

grantee or at an office of the grantor.)
      (2)   A list of the grantee's services, rates and channel lineups;

program;
      (4)   A statistical compilation of service calls provided by the
appropriate grantee category, including a description of the problem, the

billing complaints. Nothing herein shall require the grantee to maintain
statistics regarding subscriber inquiries or questions concerning the company's
billing practices, programming, policies or procedures.
      (5)   An accurate and comprehensive file of any and all complaints
regarding the cable system, in a manner consistent with the privacy rights of
subscribers, and the grantee's actions in response to those complaints.
Complaints shall not include routine billing inquiries, disagreements with
company policies or practices or inquiries regarding individual programs or
program services carried or not carried by the grantee's cable system.
   (b)   The grantee shall also make available to the grantor, upon written
request, the following information:

      (3)   A list of the grantee's operating managers, officers, members of
its boards of directors and other principals of the grantee;
      (4)   A list of stockholders or other equity investors holding five
percent or more of the voting interest in the grantee and its parent,
subsidiary and affiliated corporations and other entities, if any, unless the
parent is a public corporation whose annual reports are publicly available, in
which case a copy of the annual report shall be submitted; and
      (5)   An executive summary which shall include information concerning
customer complaints for the preceding twelve months. Such reports shall be
maintained by category. Complaints shall not include routine billing inquiries,
disagreements with company policies or practices or inquiries regarding
individual programs or program services carried or not carried by the grantee's
cable system.
   The grantee shall make available to the grantor such records upon written
request no more than one time per year. Records required by paragraph (b)(2)
hereof shall be made available to the grantor within thirty days. All other
information shall be made available to the grantor within seven days.
   (c)   Upon at least five business days written notice, and during normal
business hours, or, in case of emergency, upon demand, the grantee shall permit
examination by any duly authorized representative of the grantor, of any and
all franchise property and facilities, together with any appurtenant property
and facilities of the grantee situated within or without the Village, and any
and all records relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to
enable the grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under local,
State and Federal law, this chapter and the franchise agreement. Such records
include all books, records, maps, plans, financial statements, service
complaint logs, performance test results, records of requests for service and
other like materials of the grantee. The grantee shall have the right to be
present at any such examination.
   (d)   If any of the records described in this chapter or the franchise
agreement are proprietary in nature or must be kept confidential by State,
Federal or local law, then upon written request by the grantee, such
information requested during an inspection shall be treated as confidential,
making it available for inspection purposes only to those persons who must have
access to perform their duties on behalf of the Village, including, but not
limited to, the Treasurer and the Solicitor. To the extent that any Federal
requirement for privacy applies to the information to be submitted, said law
shall control.
   (e)   Copies of all petitions, applications, communications and reports
submitted by the grantee, or on behalf of or relating to the grantee, to the
Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or
any other Federal or State regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction
with respect to any matters affecting the cable system authorized pursuant to
this chapter and any franchise, shall be made available to the grantor upon
written request within two weeks. Copies of responses from the regulatory
agencies to the grantee shall likewise be furnished to the Village upon request
within two weeks. Upon written request by the grantor, the grantee shall make
available to the grantor copies of all pleadings, applications, notifications,
communications and documents of any kind, submitted by the grantee or its
parent corporation(s) to, as well as copies of all decisions, correspondence to
and from the grantee or its parent corporation(s) and actions by, any Federal,
State or local courts, other regulatory agencies and other government bodies
relating to the operations of the grantee's cable system within the franchise
area. Grantee shall submit such documents to the grantor no later than thirty
days after the written request.
   (f)   One copy of all reports and records mentioned in this chapter or in
the franchise agreement shall be made available upon written request to the
grantor within the time limits mentioned therein. All reports and records
required under this chapter or the franchise agreement shall be furnished at
the sole expense of the grantee, except as otherwise provided in this chapter
or in the franchise agreement.
   (g)   The failure of the grantee to report or make information available
upon written request as specified and within the time limits stated in this
chapter or the franchise agreement shall, following notice and an opportunity
to cure, subject the grantee to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) per day.
The grantee's liability to the grantor for such amount in such cases shall not
be in lieu of, but in addition to, the remedies set forth in Section
808.29 for franchise violations.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.26 ANNUAL REPORTS.
   The grantee shall submit a written end of the year report to the grantor
with respect to the preceding calendar year within 120 days of the end of that
year. Such report shall contain a summary of the previous year's activities in
the development of the cable system, including, but not limited to, services
begun or discontinued during the reporting year and improvements to the system.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.27 INSTITUTIONAL NETWORK; INTERCONNECTION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT NETWORKS.
   (a)   The grantee shall, at its cost, make available at an identified
location inside an exterior wall of the public facilities to be set forth in an
exhibit to the franchise agreement ("sites"), plus three additional facilities
designated by the grantor (which must be nonprofit institutions), two fibers,
in each case with not less than fifty feet of additional fiber extending inside
the facility ("institutional network"). Use of the fibers provided by the
grantee pursuant to this section will be limited to video and data
transmissions between and among the facilities described in this section and
any other facility attached to the institutional network under the terms of a
franchise between the grantee and the political subdivision in which such
facility is located. Any additional interior or exterior wiring or equipment
necessary to utilize the institutional network shall be at the cost of the
user. There shall be no cost to the grantor or the other designated sites for
the use and maintenance of the institutional network. In addition to the
Village, the grantee may provide telecommunications services to residential and
other non-residential subscribers on such terms and at such rates as the
grantee may in its discretion determine.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if technically feasible, the grantee
shall interconnect the institutional network with other dedicated fiber,
limited access institutional networks provided by other cable operators for the
sole purpose of providing educational access programming between school
districts and emergency agencies consisting of video or data transmissions,
provided that such interconnections shall be limited to dedicated fiber,
limited access, institutional networks servicing the municipalities and school
districts to be listed in an exhibit to the franchise agreement and may
consider other such interconnections requested by the grantor, and provided,
further, that the grantee shall not be required to provide such an
interconnection to a network located in a municipality in which it does not
have a franchise, unless the user assumes the cost of the initial connection.
All costs associated with the construction of the interconnections within the
franchise area shall be the sole responsibility of the grantee. There shall be
no cost to the grantor or the other designated sites for the use and
maintenance of the institutional network. All other costs shall be the sole
responsibility of the requesting party or the other cable operator.
   (c)   If the grantor or any of the sites has a presently existing network,
service on such network will not be unreasonably interrupted during the
building of the new system. (Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.28 PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL OR GOVERNMENT (PEG) ACCESS CHANNELS AND FACILITIES.
   (a)   Following completion of the system upgrade/rebuild, the grantee shall
make available to each of its subscribers who receive some or all of the
services offered on the system, reception of at least three public, educational
and government (PEG) access channels to be allocated among public, educational
and government usage as determined by the grantor. The channels designated for
access shall be provided by the grantee as a part of the basic cable service.
The access channels shall be made available by the grantee for use by the
Village and its citizens in accordance with the rules and procedures
established by the Village or any lawfully designated person, group,
organization or agency authorized by the Village for that purpose.
   (b)   To the extent that any access channel is not being used for the
provision of non-commercial, public, educational or governmental access
purposes, the grantee shall be permitted to use such channel(s) for the
provision of other services, subject to any reasonable rules established by the
Village regarding such use. The grantee's permitted use of any access channel
made pursuant to this section shall cease within ninety days of the grantee's
receipt of notice from the Village that such channel will again be used for
public, educational or governmental access.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the above, the grantee may accommodate a request from
the Village for additional access capacity made pursuant to Section
808.27(b) by combining more than one access use on a channel, provided that:
      (1)   It is technically and economically feasible for the grantee to do
so;
      (2)   The scheduling needs of all users of the channel can be reasonably
accommodated; and
      (3)   The access entity which requires use of the alternate channel must
be able to access the alternate channel from the site where it normally
originates playback of its programs and may not be required to transport tapes
to a remote site for playback.
   (d)   However, the grantee shall provide an additional PEG channel for non-
commercial public, educational or governmental broadcasts in the event that the
three PEG channels provided under this section are then fully utilized. In no
event shall the grantee be required to provide in excess of one additional
access channel, and only after the cable system offers at least 150 channels.
As used in this section, "fully utilized" means utilized for original,
nonduplicative programming not less than eight hours per day, five days per
week, for a period of ten consecutive weeks. The additional PEG channel
provided under this section shall be reviewed annually by the grantee. Upon
such annual review, the additional PEG channel will continue to be made
available to the grantor to the extent that the PEG channels provided under
this agreement (including the additional PEG channel(s)) are at least seventy
percent fully utilized. To the extent that such capacity requirement is not
met, the additional PEG channel shall be terminated, subject to reactivation at
the request of the grantor upon demonstration by the grantor that the three
original and any other additional PEG channels provided under this section are
fully utilized, and to the annual review provided herein.
   (e)   The grantee shall provide free cable transmission facilities and free
modulation equipment to introduce programming onto these transmission
facilities by linking the below listed origination points with the head-end, or
through hubs to the head-end, for distribution to all subscribers generally and
for distribution to discrete audiences via scrambled signals and decoders at
the origination points for such channels.
   (f)   The grantee is responsible for all head-end equipment essential to
playback of programming for PEG access use in a location and under reasonable
rules determined by the grantee. The grantee shall also be responsible for the
operation and maintenance and all equipment necessary to perform those
functions. The grantee shall also either provide a studio and equipment
acceptable to the grantor for PEG access use or pay a fee in lieu of providing
the same, equal to up to one percent of adjusted gross revenues (gross revenues
above net of the franchise fee), as stated in the franchise agreement, to be
placed by the grantor in a special fund for such PEG access purposes.
   (g)   The grantor shall be responsible for the operation of access
facilities and equipment. In this regard, the grantor may delegate from time to
time its responsibilities to others who then shall assume the responsibility of
the grantor in accordance with the grantor's delegation. The grantor will
develop reasonable rules regarding use of access facilities and equipment and
determine the needs of the Village for public, educational and governmental
access services. In this regard, the grantor shall regularly coordinate with
grantee for the purpose of developing and maintaining reasonable access
facilities.
   (h)   Costs of providing said facilities shall not be a credit against
payment of the franchise fee imposed under the franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.29 FRANCHISE VIOLATION.
   (a)   If the grantor believes that the grantee has failed to perform any
obligation under the franchise agreement or this chapter or has failed to
perform in a timely manner, the grantor may make written demand on the grantee
that it remedy the alleged failure. The grantor may order the grantee to
correct or remedy the failure or breach within the time and in the manner and
on the terms and conditions that the grantor may establish. If the alleged
failure is denied or not remedied to the reasonable satisfaction of the
grantor, the grantor may follow any procedures set forth in the agreement.
   (b)   Penalties may be assessed by the grantor for purposes including, but
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Failure of the grantee to pay the grantor sums due under the terms
of the franchise.
      (2)   Reimbursement of costs borne by the grantor to correct franchise
violations not corrected by the grantee, after thirty days written notice.
      (3)   Monetary remedies, penalties or damages assessed against the
grantee due to default or breach of franchise requirements.
   (c)   Upon written notice and agreement of the grantor and the grantee, an
informal meeting may be held at any time to review any alleged failure.
   (d)   If the grantee fails to perform in a timely manner any material
obligation required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder, following
notice from the grantor and an opportunity to cure such nonperformance, the
grantor may act to remedy such violation in accordance with the following
procedures:
The grantor shall notify the grantee of any alleged material violation in
writing by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, and demand
correction within a reasonable time, which shall not be less than ten days in
the case of the failure of the grantee to pay any sum or other amount due the
grantor under this chapter or the grantee's franchise and thirty days in all
other cases. If the grantee fails either to correct the violation within the
time prescribed, or to commence correction of the violation within the time
prescribed and thereafter diligently pursue correction of such violation, the
grantor shall then give written notice of not less than twenty days of a public
hearing to be held before the Council. Said notice shall specify the violations
alleged to have occurred. At the public hearing, the Council shall hear and
consider relevant evidence and thereafter render findings and its decision. In
the event that the Council finds that a material violation exists and that the
grantee has not corrected the same in a satisfactory manner, or has not
diligently commenced correction of such violation after notice thereof from the
grantor and is not diligently proceeding to fully remedy such violation, the
Council may revoke the franchise or impose any other penalty permitted by the
franchise agreement and any other legal or equitable remedy available under the
franchise or applicable law.
   (e)   The grantor may assess against the grantee, after providing written
notice to the grantee and allowing thirty days or such other period of time as
is agreed upon by the grantee and the grantor to cure, monetary damages up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per calendar day or per incident for material
system upgrade or construction delays, and up to two hundred dollars ($200.00)
per calendar day or per incident for any other material breaches, provided that
all violations of a similar nature occurring at the same time shall be
considered as one incident. The grantor may have recourse to the performance
bond for payment of such damages, including the fifty dollar ($50.00) per day
penalty for failure to respond to the grantor's request for information due the
grantor within the time limits as specified in this chapter or the franchise
agreement pursuant to Section
808.25(g), and the one hundred dollars ($100.00) or five hundred dollars
($500.00) per day amounts for failure to timely pay the franchise fee pursuant
to Section
808.18(e), which shall not be subject to, but in addition to, the remedies set
forth in this section. The assessment of any monetary damages shall not
constitute a waiver by the grantor of any other right or remedy it may have
under the franchise or applicable law, including its right to recover from the
grantee any additional damages, losses, costs and expenses, including
attorney's and/or consultant fees, that are incurred by the grantor by reason
of the breach of the franchise agreement.
   (f)   In addition to revocation in accordance with other provisions of the
franchise agreement, the grantor may revoke the franchise agreement and rescind
all rights and privileges associated with the franchise agreement in the
following circumstances, each of which represents a material breach of the
franchise agreement:
      (1)   If the grantee fails to perform any of its material obligations
under the franchise agreement or under any ordinances, documents or other terms
and provisions entered into by and between the grantor and the grantee;
       (2)   If there is a pattern of noncompliance with the grantor's consumer
service standards;
      (3)   If the grantee willfully and deliberately fails for more than
twenty-four hours to provide continuous and uninterrupted cable service for the
entire franchise area, not subject to force majeure, as set forth in Section
808.30;
      (4)   If the grantee practices any fraud or deceit upon the grantor or
any subscriber; or
      (5)   If the grantee becomes insolvent or if there is an order for relief
in favor of the grantee in a bankruptcy proceeding.
    Written notice of intent to consider revocation under this subsection shall
be served on the grantee at least thirty days prior to the date of revocation.
The grantor shall hear any persons interested in the revocation and, within
ninety days after the hearing, shall determine that the franchise is to be
revoked and the performance bond forfeited or that the breach at issue is
capable of being cured by the grantee. In the latter case, the grantor shall
direct the grantee to take appropriate remedial action within the time, in the
manner and under the terms and conditions that the grantor determines are
reasonable under the circumstances.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.30 FORCE MAJEURE; GRANTEE'S INABILITY TO PERFORM.
   In the event that the grantee's performance of any of the terms, conditions
or obligations required by this chapter or a franchise granted hereunder is
prevented by a cause or event not within the grantee's control, such inability
to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be
imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes or events
not within the control of the grantee shall include, without limitation, acts
of God, strikes, sabotage, riots, civil disturbances, restraints imposed by
order of a governmental agency or court, failure or loss of utilities,
explosions, acts of public enemies, and natural disasters such as floods,
earthquakes, landslides, and fires. In the event that any such delay in
performance or failure to perform affects only part of the grantee's capacity
to perform, the grantee shall perform to the maximum extent it is able to do so
and shall take all steps within its power to correct such cause(s). In
correcting such cause(s), the grantee shall take all reasonable steps to do so
in as expeditious a manner as possible. The grantee shall notify the grantor in
writing of the occurrence of an event covered by this section within five
business days of the date upon which the grantee learns of its occurrence.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.31 ABANDONMENT OR REMOVAL OF FRANCHISE PROPERTY.
   (a)   In the event that the use of any property of the grantee within the
franchise area or a portion thereof is discontinued for a continuous period of
twelve months, the grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise
property.
   (b)   The grantor, upon such terms as the grantor may impose, may give the
grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or
equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the
franchise. Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided in
this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities
and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and shall restore
any affected street to its former state at the time such facilities and
equipment were installed, so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its
plant, structures and equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense,
any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and
places in as good a condition as they were prior to such removal without
materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility
wires, poles or attachments. The grantor shall have the right to inspect and
approve the condition of the public ways, public places, cables, wires,
attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and
insurance provisions of this chapter and any performance bond provided in the
franchise shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal
and until full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
section.
   (c)   Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the grantee, if
required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an instrument,
satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor the ownership
of the franchise property abandoned.
   (d)   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or
upon its revocation or earlier expiration as provided for herein, in any such
case without renewal, extension or transfer, the grantor shall have the right
to require the grantee to remove, at its own expense, all above-ground portions
of the cable television system from all streets and public ways within the
Village within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than 180
days. The indemnification and insurance provisions and the performance bond
shall remain in full force and effect during the period of removal.
   (e)   If the grantee fails to complete any removal required by this section
or any other work required by law within the time limits set by the grantor
after the date of written notice and to the satisfaction of the grantor, the
grantor may cause the work to be done and:

(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)

The grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions
of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber service

   (a)   A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the grantor,
cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or
trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of the grantee,
whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or
proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated
prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
      (1)   Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of
this chapter and the franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership or
trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all the faults under the
franchise or provided a plan for the remedy of such faults which is
satisfactory to the grantor; and
      (2)   Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.
   (b)   In the case of a foreclosure or other involuntary or judicial sale of
the franchise property, or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve

in which event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges of the
grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such

grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.34 RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.
   (a)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor by this
chapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which is required
to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the franchise.
   (b)   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by Federal or State regulation, if the grantor
determines that it is in the public interest to do so and that the enforcement
of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or the
subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in
writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the grantor. Waiver of
any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision
subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of
the franchise unless the statement so recites.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.35 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (a)   The grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise
discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, gender or
sexual preference. The grantee shall comply at all times with all other
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations relating to
nondiscrimination.
   (b)   The grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of Federal, State and local regulations.
   (c)   Neither the grantee nor any other person shall, without the
subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping of any cable line, signal
input device or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine
maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized service and polling with
audience-participating or audience-viewing surveys to support advertising
research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be
identified.
   (d)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general citizen's
right of privacy, as defined in the Cable Act, or other personal rights,
through the use of the system, as such rights are delineated or defined by
applicable law. The grantee shall not, without a lawful court order or other
applicable valid legal authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way
equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any
subscriber or general citizen.
   (e)   The grantee shall not sell or otherwise make available to unaffiliated
third parties (including the grantor) lists of the names and addresses of
subscribers, any list which identifies, by name, subscriber viewing habits, or
any personalized data pertaining to a subscriber's use of any of the
franchisee's services, without the express written consent of the subscriber to
which the personalized data pertains. For the purposes of this subsection,
"personalized data" shall mean the name and address of an individual subscriber
directly associated with data obtained on his or her use of specific services
provided by or through the grantee. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent, as a normal incident of commercial enterprise, the sale or
availability of nonpersonalized or aggregated data which are not personalized
data, as defined herein.
   (f)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter or other piece of equipment
owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the subscriber's
premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any
required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon
the subscriber's property shall be presumed. Where a property owner or his or
her predecessor has granted an easement, including a public utility easement or
a servitude, to another, and the servitude by its terms contemplates a use such
as the grantee's intended use, the grantee shall not be required to obtain the
written permission of the owner for the installation of cable television
equipment.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.36 TIME LIMITS STRICTLY CONSTRUED.
   Whenever the franchise agreement sets forth a time for any material act to
be performed by the grantee, such time shall be deemed to be of the essence,
and any failure of the grantee to perform within the allotted time may be
considered sufficient grounds for the grantor to invoke any relevant penalty
provision of the franchise agreement or this chapter in accordance with the
provisions of Section
808.18(e),
808.25(g) or
808.29, as applicable.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.37 DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY.
   (a)   The grantor shall be vested, to the extent permitted by law, with the
power and right to regulate reasonably the exercise of the privileges permitted
by the franchise agreement in the public interest, or to delegate that power
and right, or any part thereof, to any agent, Village officer or employee or
established board, authority or commission, provided, however, that the
establishment of any such board, commission or authority, or the delegation of
such authority to any Village employee or agent, shall not relieve the grantor,
acting through its Village Council, of its ultimate authority and
responsibility as grantor hereunder, and provided, further, that all final
determinations required hereunder to be made by the grantor shall be made by
the Village Council as provided by law.
   (b)   The grantee shall not be relieved of its obligations to comply,
promptly and completely, with any provision of the franchise by any failure of
the grantor to promptly enforce compliance with the franchise.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.38 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   In the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and a
franchise agreement entered pursuant to it, the provisions of this chapter
shall control, except as may be specifically otherwise provided in the
franchise agreement.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)
808.39 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter, or any franchise agreement executed
subject to it, is held by any court, or by any Federal, State or county agency
of competent jurisdiction, to be invalid as conflicting with any Federal or
State law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect, or is held by such
court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the
requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be
considered a separate, distinct and independent part of this chapter, and such
holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other
provisions hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect for the
term of any franchise agreement or renewal or renewals thereof. In the event of
such determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, the grantor or the
grantee shall have the option to amend the parts of the franchise agreement
related to the affected sections. In the event that such law, rule or
regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed,
so that the provision hereof which had been held invalid or modified is no
longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation, said provision shall
thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on
the grantor and the grantee, provided that the grantor shall give the grantee
sixty days written notice of such change before requiring compliance with said
provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for the
grantee to comply with such provision.
(Ord. 1997-39. Passed 4-9-97.)

intent to offer service in the Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 1332.27 and as
compensation for the benefits and privileges granted under the State of Ohio
video service authorization and in consideration of permission to use the
City's streets and rights-of-way, the VSP shall pay to the Village a video
service provider fee in the amount of 5% of the VSP's gross revenues, including
advertising revenues, as defined by Ohio R.C. 1332.32. Notice of this video
service provider fee shall be served upon the VSP by the Mayor, or duly
appointed designee, within ten days of the Village receiving notice of the

   (b)   The Village, at its sole expense, may conduct an annual audit for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of a VSP's calculation of the video service
provider fees paid to the municipal corporation in the audit period. For the
purpose of the audit, the VSP shall make available for inspection, at the
location where such records are kept in the normal course of business, those
records pertaining to gross revenues, including advertising revenues.
   (c)   A VSP shall pay any amounts found to have been underpaid in the audit
within 30 days after notice and shall include interest on the underpayments as
provided in Ohio R.C. 1343.03, unless the VSP brings an action pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 1332.33(D).
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by
the Village shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of
any claim the Village may have for further or additional sums payable as a
video service provider fee or from the performance of any other obligation of
the VSP.
   (e)   Video service provider fee payments shall be made no sooner than 45
nor later than 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter.

Ohio R.C. 1332.26.

competitive video service agreement, ordinance, or resolution shall continue to
provide the PEG channel(s) in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C.
1332.30.
   (i)   All VSPs within the Village, upon written notice, shall be required to
provide the same number of PEG channels as required under Ohio R.C. 1332.30(A)
(1)(a) and (b). Notice shall state the appropriate number of PEG channels and
the service tiers required. Following receipt of that notice, the person shall
provide PEG channels not later than 120 days after the municipal corporation is
able to deliver the PEG channel content.

suspension, the Village may assess the licensee a penalty fee of not less than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars
($1,500) for any violation of this chapter. Each day a continuing violation
exists shall constitute a separate violation for purpose of assessing penalty
fees. Suspensions, revocations and assessments of penalty fees is in addition

Federal laws.
   (b)   Any person may submit a written complaint to the Village in regard to
any sweepstakes/internet café location, which shall include the name and
address of the complainant, the location of the sweepstakes/internet café, and

by the resident.
   (d)   No appeal shall lie from the decision to dismiss a complaint.
   (e)   If the complaint is not dismissed, the Mayor, or his or her designee,
will then notify the licensee and the owner of the devices on the premises, as

a date for a conference on the matter. Extensions will be granted and necessary
investigations will be conducted at the discretion of the Mayor, who may
request the assistance of any person in law enforcement to assist in the
investigation. The Village and its designee and any law enforcement officer
shall have access to the premises and the records of the licensee during all
times that the computerized sweepstakes devices are available for play.
   (f)   At the time of the conference, the complainant, the licensee, the
Mayor, or his or her designee, and the owner of the devices will meet and
attempt to amicably resolve the situation. If the complainant, licensee, Mayor,
or his or her designee, and the owner of the devices can reach an amicable
solution, the Village will direct the licensee to comply with the solution in
his notice of reconciliation.
   (g)   If the parties cannot agree upon an amicable solution to the problem,
the complaint shall be transmitted to the Director of Law for consideration.
The recommendation may be for dismissal of the complaint, suspension of the
license and assessment of penalty fees, or revocation of the license.
   (h)   Consideration of the complaint shall be a public hearing which shall
be held within 30 days after said notice is given. The complainant, the
licensee and the owner of the devices, as listed on the license application,
shall be notified at least 15 days in advance of the hearing by certified mail;
and they may, if they so choose, be present during consideration of the
complaint. The licensee shall have the right to be represented by counsel, and
have the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence.

licensee, the licensee shall have the right to appeal such decision and ruling
to a court of competent jurisdiction under authority of and pursuant to the
provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (i)   This complaint process is separate and distinct from any law
enforcement action taken to enforce the laws of the State or the Village and is

to any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis, if the percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items.

reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Clerk in monthly
installments and remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day of the
month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the tax is
collected or received, provided that the first return and remittance under this

five-week policy month period, as the case may be.
   (d)   The payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless the payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Clerk, but
payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from liability
for the payment and remittance of the tax to the Clerk, unless the check is
honored and is in the full and correct amount.
   (e)   The person receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a
return upon a form prescribed by the Clerk, setting forth the information that
the Clerk may require, showing the amount of the tax upon admissions for which
he or she is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and
transmit the same to the Clerk with a remittance for such amount, provided,
however, that the Clerk may, in his or her discretion, require verified annual
returns from any person receiving admission payments, setting forth such
additional information as he or she may deem necessary to determine correctly
the amount of tax collected and payable.
   (f)   Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or
amusement makes an admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied,
and the same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Clerk shall
be the judge, the Clerk may require the report and remittance of the admissions
tax immediately upon the collection of the same, at the conclusion of the
performance or exhibition, at the conclusion of the series of performances or
exhibitions, or at such other times as the Clerk shall determine.
   (g)   Failure to comply with any requirement of the Clerk as to report and
remittance of the tax as required shall be a violation of this chapter. The
books, records and accounts of any person collecting a tax herein levied shall,
as to admission charges and tax collections, be at all reasonable times subject
to examination and audit by the Clerk. If the tax imposed by this chapter is
not paid when due, there shall be added, as part of the tax, interest at the
rate of one percent per month from the time when the tax became due until paid.

building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section
880.04 by the owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting
the place.
   The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose shall
furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner, lessee

the owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified by the Clerk of the issuance
of the Certificate and the joint liability for the collection and remittance of
the tax.

payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of the
rules and regulations shall be posted on the bulletin board in the Village Hall
at least once before they shall become effective, and copies shall be printed

882.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Subject to the provisions of Section
882.06, an annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
882.01 shall be imposed on and after October 1, 2002, at the rate of 2% per
year upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after October 1, 2002, by residents of the
Village. For clarification “income” includes, but is not limited to:
         A.   Lottery, gambling and sports winnings, games of chance, and
prizes, award, and/or contest winnings (whether or not the winnings are
predetermined). Provided, however, there shall be no tax imposed upon lottery
winnings or other gambling winnings of less than one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000).
         B.   If the taxpayer is considered a professional gambler for Federal
income tax purposes, related deductions as permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after October 1, 2002, by nonresidents for work
done or services performed or rendered in the Village. Separation pay,
termination pay, reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation paid as a
result of an employee leaving the service of an employer shall be allocable
only to the Village.
         A.   The Village shall not, however, tax the compensation of a
nonresident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all of
the following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the Village on 12 or fewer days during the calendar year, in
which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the Village income tax. A “day” is a full day or any fractional
part of a day.
            2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the Village
and the individual pays tax on compensation described in Section
882.03(a)(2) to the municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal
place of business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the
individual.
            3.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by
the Village.
         B.   Beginning with the thirteenth day, if an individual deemed to
have been an occasional entrant to the Village performs services within the
Village, the employer of said individual shall begin withholding the Village
income tax from remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall
remit the withheld income tax to the Village in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered
to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit
taxes on income earned in the Village by the individual for the first 12 days.
         C.   If the individual is seif-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
Village.
      (3)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on and after October 1, 2002, of all resident unincorporated businesses,

services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in
the Village.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits

or owner of a resident unincorporated business entity, including associations,
not attributable to the Village, and not levied against such unincorporated
business entity.
      (4)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on and after October 1, 2002, by all nonresident unincorporated
businesses, professions, associations or other activities, derived from work

conducted in the Village, whether or not such unincorporated business entity
has an office or place of business in the Village.

earned and/or received on and after October 1, 2002, by a resident partner and/

unincorporated business entity.
      (5)   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned on and after October 1, 2002, of all corporations derived from work done
or services performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in
the Village, whether or not such corporations have an office or place of
business in the Village.
      (6)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:
         A.   If no portion of the net profits of the S corporation are
allocated or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the distributive share is
taxable only to the extent that it represents wages or net earnings from self-
employment; however,
         B.   If any portion of the net profits of the S corporation are
allocated or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the full amount of the
distributive share related to the Ohio allocation is taxable.
   (b)   Rentals from Real Property.
      (1)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities only if, and to the extent
that, the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate from
which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by the
taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives) constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless
of number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
in this Village, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer and the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owners shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds the rental rate of this Village;
provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds the rental rate of this
Village; and provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming
house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds
the rental rate of this Village.
      (3)   Rental income received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying or selling real estate shall always be considered as part of business
income.
      (4)   Owners of rental property who are nonresidents of this Village,
whether individuals or business entities, are subject to tax only on the income
from real property located in this Village. In determining whether gross
monthly rentals exceed the rental rate of this Village, only the income from
such properties located within this Village shall be considered. Net losses may
be offset against net profits only between rental properties located in this
Village.
      (5)   Owners of rental property who are residents of this Village are
subject to tax on the net income from rentals (to the extent above specified),
regardless of the location of the real property owned, excepting that if any
such property is located and subject to a municipal income tax by another
taxing municipality, credit shall be claimed in accordance with Section
882.14.
      (6)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on the
portion of income derived from property located in this Village.
   (c)   Determination of Allocation of Tax (Method of Determination).
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this section, “real property” shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed. For tax year 2004 and subsequent tax years, wages,
salaries, and other compensation shall be included to the extent they represent
qualifying wages.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula in Section
882.03(c)(1) does not produce an equitable result, another basis (including the
books and records method) may, under uniform regulations of the Village, be
substituted so as to produce such result.
      (3)   As used in subsection (c)(1)C. hereof, “sales made in the Village”
means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village;
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (d)   The following provisions apply with respect to the carry-forward of
net operating losses:
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer in any
taxable year, attributable to the Village, may be applied against the portion
of the net profits of the taxpayer attributable to the Village in succeeding
taxable years until exhausted, but in no event for more than five taxable years
immediately following the taxable year in which the loss occurred. No portion
of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer shall be carried back against
net profits of any prior taxable year.

decedent's estate during the period of administration, except such income from
the operation of a business.
      (14)   Income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and
net profits, of which the taxation is prohibited by the United States
Constitution or any act of Congress limiting the power of the states or their
political subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from
interstate commerce, and/or is prohibited by the Constitution of the State of
Ohio or any act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of a
municipality to impose net income taxes.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)

(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Unless otherwise exempted in this chapter, each individual taxpayer 18
years of age or older and any corporation, association, business and/or other
entity who engages in business, or whose income, qualifying wages, commissions
and other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by this chapter and any
corporation, association, business and/or other entity who engages in business
shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a final return on or
before April 15 of each year, or on or before the federal filing date if it is
other than April 15. When a return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on the fifteenth
day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or period, or on or
before the Federal filing date if it is other than the fifteenth day of the
fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or period.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Administrator, or on
an acceptable generic form as defined in this chapter, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of income, qualifying wages, commissions and
other compensation earned and/or received and gross receipts from business,
profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross receipts earned during the preceding year and subject
to the tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including a statement that
the figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for Federal
income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the
provisions of this chapter, and including but not limited to copies of all W-
2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, page one of form 1040, Form 1120,
1120S (including (K-1), 2106 (Including Schedule A of Form 1040), 1065,
Schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or sold), Schedule E,
Schedule F and any other Federal schedules, if applicable. For businesses the
entire Federal return and supporting schedules shall be submitted.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing the annual return
upon the request of the taxpayer. The extended due date for individuals, and
for businesses not filing the extension request through the Ohio Business
Gateway, shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
Federal income tax due date has been extended. For businesses filing the
extension request through the Ohio Business Gateway, the extended due date
shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the Federal income
tax return has been extended. The Tax Administrator may deny the extension if
the taxpayer fails to:
      (1)   File the request timely;
      (2)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request; or
      (3)   The taxpayer's income tax account with the Village is delinquent in
any way. For each year for which an extension is requested, a tentative return,
accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon, must be
filed by the date the return is normally due. No penalty or interest shall be
assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.
   (d)   The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
882.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
882.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the final return. Within three months from the final determination of
any Federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return, showing income subject
to the Village tax, based upon such final determination of Federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.
   (e)   (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for
Federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue
Code may file a consolidated return with the Village.
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as may be necessary to ascertain whether
net profits allocable to the Village are being distorted by the shifting of
income, apportionment of expenses or other devices available to a common
control. If the Tax Administrator finds that a person's net profits allocable
to the Village are distorted by reason of transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates
or transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he shall adjust such transactions so as to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village. If
necessary, the Tax Administrator may require the filing of a consolidated
return.
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (g)   (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements or limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
882.01 through
882.05. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e.,
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village tax
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Each taxpayer may offset business losses against business net profits
from any business conducted in the Village. Business losses in any municipality
that do not levy an income tax on net profits may be used to offset net profits
in the Village. Business net profits in any municipality that do not levy an
income tax on net profits may be offset by losses in the Village.
   (i)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (j)   Business losses cannot be offset against income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation that represent employee income and/or other
non-business income.
   (k)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (l)   The failure of any employer, taxpayer or person to receive or procure
a return, declaration, or other required form shall not excuse him from filing
any information return, tax return, declaration, or other required form, or
from paying the tax.
   (m)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
tax due or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or
limitations contained in this chapter, such amended return shall be on a form
obtainable on request from the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer may not change the
method of accounting (i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits
after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return, showing income subject to the Village
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay an
additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village who employs
one or more persons on an income, qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis shall deduct at the time of the payment of such income,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, the tax provided for in
Section
882.03 and shall make a return and pay to the Village Income Tax Office, the
amount of taxes so deducted, on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to
the Tax Administrator as follows:
      (1)   If the total amount of tax withheld by an employer in the prior
calendar year averaged less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month the
employer shall, on or before the last day of the month following each calendar
quarter, make the return required by this section and pay the amount of taxes
so deducted during the preceding calendar quarter. However, the Tax
Administrator shall have the authority to require a taxpayer that is remitting
quarterly payments to begin remitting monthly payments if the conditions for
remitting quarterly payments were judged incorrectly, the conditions have
substantially changed so that it is in the best interest of the Village to
require monthly payments, and/or the taxpayer is delinquent in remitting
quarterly payments.
      (2)   An employer who deducts taxes amounting to one hundred dollars
($100.00) or more per calendar quarter, based on the previous tax year's
quarterly average, shall, on or before the last day of each month, make the
return required by this section and pay the amount of taxes so deducted during
the preceding calendar month.
   (b)   The failure of an employer to withhold taxes required by this section
as required by law does not relieve an employee from the liability for the tax.
   (c)   Each employer required to deduct and withhold taxes is liable for the
payment of that amount required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld and such amount shall be deemed to be a
special fund in trust for the Village until such time as same is paid to the
Village.
   (d)   On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return, setting forth the names, addresses, and social security
numbers of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and such other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
   (e)   On or before February 28 of each year, all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or others who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (those who are not
subject to withholding), must provide the Village with copies of all 1099
Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social Security
numbers or Federal identification numbers and a total amount of earnings,
payments, bonuses, commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
   (f)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility for withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report
or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a
corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
in whole or in part to the withholding requirements of Section
882.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity,
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income and/or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any. However, if a person's income is wholly from
income, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensations from which the tax
will be fully withheld and remitted to the Village in accordance with this
chapter, or if a person's annual income tax liability from which the tax will
not be fully withheld is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), such person
need not file a declaration.
   (b)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or on or before the federal filing date if it
is other than April 15.
   (c)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period, or on or before the Federal filing date if it is other
than the fifteenth day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or
period.
   (d)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Administrator, or on an acceptable generic form as
defined in this chapter, which form or forms may require a statement that the
figures used in making such declaration are the figures used in making the
declaration of the estimate for the Federal income tax adjusted to set forth
only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid the Village shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated non-withheld
and/or under-withheld tax due.
      (1)   If the taxpayer is an individual, at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before the last day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th), and
thirteenth (13th) months after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year,
provided that in case an amended declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is
taxable for a portion of the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in
equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   If the taxpayer Is a corporation or association, whether reporting
on a calendar or fiscal tax year, at least a similar amount shall be paid on or
before the fifteenth day of the sixth (6th), ninth (9th), and twelfth (12th)
months of the taxable year; provided, however, that in case an amended
declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be paid
in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   No penalties or interest shall be assessed, for not filing a
declaration, if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
         A.   The resident taxpayer was not domiciled in the Village on the
first day of January in the year in which he became subject to estimated
payments.
         B.   The taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 100% of the previous
year's tax liability, provided that the previous year reflected a 12-month
period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year.
         C.   On or before April 15, or the Federal due date if other than
April 15, of the current year the taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to 90%
of the final tax liability for the year for which the tax is due.
   (f)   The original declaration (or any subsequent amendment thereof) may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment date as
provided for herein.
   (g)   On or before April 15 of the year following that for which such
declaration or amended declaration was filed or, in the case of a fiscal year
taxpayer, on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the close of
the fiscal year for which a declaration was filed, an annual return shall be
filed and any balance which may be due the Village shall be paid therewith in
accordance with the provisions of Section
882.05. The due dates in this provision shall be adjusted to the Federal due
dates for any year in which the Federal due dates are other than those
contained in this provision.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.08 DUTIES OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from
the taxpayers; to keep an accurate record thereof; and to report all money so
received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Administrator to enforce payment of
all taxes owed to the Village, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six
years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to make any return,
including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payments
thereof.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the re-examination and corrections of returns.
Taxpayers are required to comply with the requirements of this chapter and any
rules and regulations.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proven to the Tax Administrator that, due to certain
hardship conditions, the taxpayer is unable to pay the full amount of tax due.
Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by the taxpayer under this chapter. Failure to
make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount,
including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the provisions
of Sections
882.11 and
882.12 shall apply.
   (d)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax
Administrator may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Village
from the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing
the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon,
if any. Such determination may be modified or amended based upon information or
data subsequently secured by or made available to the Tax Administrator. If the
taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within 30 days, the tax, penalties,
and interest assessed shall become due and payable and collectible as are other
unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest.
   (e)   Subject to review by the Board of Review or pursuant to regulation
approved by said Board, the Tax Administrator shall have the power to
compromise any interest or penalty, or both.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.09 INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby
authorized to examine the books, papers, records and Federal and State income
tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to the tax for
the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
made, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer,
supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and
required to furnish, within ten calendar days following a written request by
the Tax Administrator or his duly authorized agent or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as
are hereby authorized.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person to
appear at the office of the Tax Administrator and examine any person, under
oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation
or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may
compel the production of books, papers, records and Federal and State income
tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or
witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or
information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)   The refusal to produce books, papers, records and Federal and State
income tax returns, or the refusal of such examination by any employer or
person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
882.99.
   (d)   Every taxpayer shall maintain, and retain for a period of six years
after the date a declaration or return is due or withholding taxes paid, all
records necessary to exhibit and compute his liability for taxes due or to be
withheld under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any information gained as the result of any returns,
investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by this
chapter shall be confidential except for official tax purposes or except in
accordance with proper judicial order. Any person divulging such information in
violation of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a first degree misdemeanor
and fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned for not
more than six months, or both. Each disclosure shall constitute a separate
offense.
      (2)   In addition to the above penalty any employee or appointed official
of the Village who violates the provisions of this section relative to the
disclosure of confidential information shall be guilty of an offense punishable
by immediate dismissal.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.10 INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNPAID TAXES; LATE FILING PENALTY.
   (a)   All taxes imposed, including estimated taxes, and all moneys withheld
or required to be withheld by employers, under the provisions of this chapter
and remaining unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at the rate of
1% per month or fraction of a month.
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes, including estimated payments, when due,
other than taxes withheld, 1% per month or fraction of a month, with a minimum
penalty of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, 10% per month
or fraction of a month, with a minimum penalty of two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00).
      (3)   For failure to file the tax return when due, and if the taxpayer is
not otherwise exempt from the filing requirement, the Tax Administrator may
impose a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each offense, in addition
to any other penalties which may otherwise be imposed.
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Administrator; and provided
further, that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed, and the additional tax is paid within
three months after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   (d)   Upon recommendation of the Tax Administrator, the Board of Review may
abate penalty or interest, or both, as in its discretion deems proper.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties, by suit. All additional assessments shall be made
and all actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest
thereon shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return
was filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of fraud, omission of 25%
or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all
additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover municipal
income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six
years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded, unless a claim for a
refund is made. Claims for refund of municipal income taxes must be brought
within three years after the tax was paid or the return was filed, whichever is
later. In addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld
from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
where that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP, and
upon which municipal tax was withheld, will be issued a refund on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates apply to the deferral tax
years, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used to compute
the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that
should have been deposited with the Village but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the Village. The Village will
allow a non-refundable credit for any amount owed the Village that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village's tax rate. If
the Village's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of
the rates is also subject to collection by the Village.
(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)

(Ord. 2010-51. Passed 5-12-10.)
882.13 BOARD OF REVIEW; APPEALS; HEARINGS.
   (a)   A Board of Review, consisting of the Village Clerk or an employee of
the Village or other person designated by him or her, the Solicitor or an

882.09 hereof with reference to the confidential character of information
required to be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be
heard before the Board on appeal.
   (d)   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the Tax
Administrator which is made under the authority conferred by this chapter and
the rules and regulations and who has filed the required returns or other
documents pertaining to the contested issue may appeal therefrom to the Board
within 30 days from the announcement of such ruling or decision by the Tax
Administrator. The appeal shall be in writing and shall state why the decision
should be deemed incorrect or unlawful. The Board shall, on hearing, have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or decision, or any
part thereof. The Board must schedule a hearing within 45 calendar days of
receiving the appeal. The Board must issue a written decision within 90 days

Municipal Taxable Income of every person residing in and/or earning and/or
receiving income in the Village.
   (a)   Individuals.
      (1)   For residents of the Village, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
883.02(c)(16)).
      (2)   For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
      (3)   For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section
883.02(c)(21). Exemptions which may apply are specified in Section

taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village with

each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:

to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal

the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

               As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
883.04(b);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to

this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

883.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (d)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
883.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (d)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.

the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (d)(3)A. or B. of this section solely

the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax chapter.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (d)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (d)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

      (9)   Intentionally left blank.
   (e)   (1)   As used in this division:
         A.   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            1.   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            2.   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         B.   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         C.   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            1.   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            2.   Any location in this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section 883.04, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         D.   "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            1.   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            2.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (e)(1)D.1. of this section, the reporting location in
this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly or
periodically reports during the taxable year;
            3.   If no reporting location exists in this state for an employee
or owner under division (e)(1)D.1. or 2. of this section, the location that the
taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's qualifying reporting
location, provided the assignment is made in good faith and is recorded and
maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer may change the
qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or owner under this
division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (d) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
            A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
            The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
            After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies
to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
            Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (d)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (e)(2) of this section:
         A.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)A. of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         B.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)B. of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         C.   For the purpose of division (d)(1)C. of this section, and
notwithstanding division (d)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (d)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
883.04.

883.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding Provisions.
      (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
883.03 or division (a)(2)D. or F. of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
883.01, of 2.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
            1.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety- nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
                  Payments under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month for which the tax was withheld.
            2.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
            3.   Intentionally left blank.
         B.   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
         C.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of an nonresident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
         D.   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Municipal Income Tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
         E.   1.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            2.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
         F.   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Municipal income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
         G.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
         H.   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
            1.   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Village during the preceding calendar year;
            2.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
            3.   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar year;
            4.   Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
            5.   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
         I.   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
         J.   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Village income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
         K.   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
   (b)   Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

employer.
         B.   "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this State, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         C.   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this State to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this State at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
               If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (b)(2)B. of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted
for "municipal corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that
division.

events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.
         G.   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this State at which the employer provides services for more than 20
days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the home of
an employee.
      (2)   A.   Subject to divisions (b)(3), (5), and (6) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold Village income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the Village if
the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in
Municipality.
            2,   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               a.   The nature of the services is such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
            3.   The employee is a resident of the Village and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section 883.04.
            4.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (b)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pickup for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (b)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (b)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is in the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
883.02, the employer shall withhold Village income tax on all of the employee's
qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the Village,
regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (b)(2)A. and (b)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section 883.04.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15; 2016-12. Passed 2-10-16; Ord. 2016- 90. Passed

883.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   (1)   An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed
by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to
the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
         A.   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
883.05 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
         B.   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

         B.   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form W-
2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information reported on the
taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service Form 1041, Form

to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
               A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway.
         D.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (a)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G). The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required if the net

            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to Municipality. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
          B.   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date of the Village’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
            1.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
            2.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
         C.   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Village income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
         D.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
         E.   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (a)(7)B., (a)(7)B.2., or (a)(7)C. of this
section, the tax administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to
the taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files
the return or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever
occurs first.
               If a tax administrator violates division (a)(7)E. of this
section, the municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any
reasonable costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
               Division (a)(7)E. of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (a)(7)B. of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (a)(7)B. of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (a)(7)B.2. of this section.
         F.   To the extent that any provision in this division (a)(7)
conflicts with any provision in divisions (c)(1) through (4) of this section,
the provisions in divisions (c)(1), (2), (3), or (4) prevail.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the

unless the provisions of division (a)(8)C. apply.
         C.   1.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Village income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
               a.   The person was required to file a tax return with Village
for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
883.04(b)(1)G.) within Village.
               b.   The person no longer provides services in the Village and
does not expect to be subject to Village income tax for the taxable year.
            2.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village, make any sales in the Village or otherwise become subject
to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with the Village income tax ordinance and rules and regulations.” The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (a)
(8)C.2. the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
            4.   Nothing in division (a)(8)C. of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
      (9)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
      (10)   Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
883.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this chapter and any other Village ordinances, resolutions, or rules and
regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
   (b)   Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to

filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
   (c)   Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Village for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the
member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the one hundred
eighty-first day after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (c)(2)A. of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
      (3)   A.   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
         B.   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (c)(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the Armed Forces.
            2.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(c)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(3)B.1. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (c)(1) trough (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (c)(2)B. and C. of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
   (d)   Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
earner that would otherwise be included in the group.
         B.   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         C.   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (d)
(1)A. of this section.
         D.   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
         E.   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Village income
tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a
consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The
election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable
year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (d)(2)B. of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (d)(1)A. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         C.   An election made under division (d)(2)A. or B. of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
         D.   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by a taxpayer under division (d)(2)A. or B. of this section
is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of the five-year period.
         E.   When an election is made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a
valid election made under R.C. § 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator
for the remainder of the five-year period.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (d)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
883.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "Federal
taxable income" wherever "Federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation’s" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
883.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall do one of the
following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this Section
883.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this Section
883.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this Section
883.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (d)(1) through (8) of this
Section
883.05 by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

883.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter.
   (b)   The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (d)   Intentionally left blank.

   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for Village income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         A.   Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by

      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable
year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of
the twelfth month of the taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
883.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the Village under
Section
883.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

883.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person

883.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section

   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;

   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
883.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, and the earliest
Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section

883.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a non-refundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (c)   If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carry-forward.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only:
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
883.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by Village. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of oveipayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
883.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or State
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village
income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or State tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten ($10.00) dollars.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
883.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
883.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If, upon final determination of the appeal, an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section 883.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
883.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the Postal Service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the Postal
Service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
      "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten (10) days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20% as determined by voting rights, of the
addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Tax Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-85. Passed 11-11-15.)
883.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or State law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

      (5)   "Return" includes any tax return, report, reconciliation, schedule,

         B.   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required to
be paid or remitted to the Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (c)   Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

883.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
   (a)   Authority. Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the
Tax Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless
the performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as provided
by law, including the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the Village's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section

      (7)   A.   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made;
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or other
appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-determine, or
correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order which the Tax
Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the
appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final.
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
883.04.
   (b)   Verification of Accuracy of Returns and Determination of Liability.
      (1)   A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
   (c)   Identification Information.
      (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
883.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
883.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor
of the Village. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may not be
the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the

legislative authority. The Board member appointed by the Mayor of Village shall
serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person

meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.

as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.

days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing, unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.

length into blocks six feet long, except at closures where the block may be a
minimum of four feet long and a maximum of seven feet long.
   (d)   Thickness. All sidewalks constructed shall have a uniform thickness of
four inches for walks subjected to pedestrian traffic only, and six inches for
walks subjected to vehicular traffic.
   (e)   Grade and Slope. All sidewalks constructed shall be above and parallel
to the established top of the curb grade of the street and shall slope toward

      (1)   The height that the sidewalk shall be above the top of the curb
grade is determined as shown in the following paragraphs.
      (2)   All curb lawns shall slope up and away from the curb at the rate of

   Except as otherwise provided in Section
1250.02 or in any other provision of this Zoning Code, no building or premises
shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected,
raised, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or structurally altered,
except in conformity with the regulations specified in this Zoning Code for the
district in which it is located and in accordance with any permit issued by the
Building Commissioner as required by law.
(Ord. 1953-21. Passed 5-13-53; Ord. 2004-193. Passed 11-10-04.)
1250.02 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   A nonconforming use existing at the time of the effective date of this
Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, may be continued.
   (b)   A nonconforming use which is voluntarily discontinued for one year or
more, or a building or other structure devoted to a nonconforming use, which is
voluntarily or intentionally altered, removed, damaged or destroyed to an
extent exceeding 60 percent of its current fair market value, or which is
abandoned by an affirmative act manifestly evidencing an intention to
discontinue indefinitely such nonconforming use, shall not be altered,
restored, rebuilt, replaced or reinstituted, except as a conforming use,
building or structure.
   (c)   A building or other structure devoted to a nonconforming use which is
involuntarily or accidentally altered, removed, damaged or destroyed is
entitled to be altered, restored, rebuilt or replaced to its previous condition
and use, upon application to and after review and approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission. Such approval shall be granted unless the Commission shall
determine that the applicant is not entitled to the benefits of this section.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing shall prevent
the strengthening or restoration to a safe and sanitary condition of any part
of a building declared unsafe or unsanitary by a public official acting in his
or her authorized capacity, nor deny or limit the right or power of the Village
at any time to abate or order the removal of any use specifically prohibited or
any nonconforming use which constitutes a nuisance per se.
   (e)   A nonconforming use may not be changed unless changed to a higher use.
A nonconforming use, if changed to a conforming use, may not thereafter be
changed back to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a
higher nonconforming use, may not thereafter be changed unless to a still
higher use.
   (f)   For the purpose of this Zoning Code, a use shall be deemed to be
changed if changed from a use included in a subdivision of a use class to a use
not included in such subdivision, and a nonconforming use shall be deemed to be
changed to a higher use if the use to which such nonconforming use is changed
is a use included in a subdivision of a use class that, in the arrangement of
classes and subdivisions in the classification of uses, preceded the
subdivision in which such nonconforming use is included.
(Ord. 2004-193. Passed 11-10-04; Ord. 2006-186. Passed 11-8-06.)
1250.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.  
   (a)   Development Permitted. Regardless of the size of a lot of record that
legally existed as of the effective date of this Zoning Code or any applicable
amendment thereto, and subject to the requirements of Section
1250.02(b), such lot may be developed for any use permitted in the district in
which the lot is located, provided that where setback, width, open space,
density, or other requirements make development impractical, the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals may permit development to occur after granting
specific variances.
   (b)   Consolidation Required. If two or more lots or parcels are contiguous,
in single and common ownership, and are of record as of the effective date of
this Zoning Code, or any applicable amendment thereto, and if all or part of
the lots or parcels with no principal structures thereon do not meet the
minimum lot area requirements set forth in the applicable district regulations
of this Code, then the lands involved shall be considered to be a single,
undivided parcel for the purposes of this Code. No portion of such parcel shall
be used or sold in a manner that renders compliance with the lot area
requirements set forth in this Code less feasible, nor shall any division of
any parcel be made that creates a lot with a width or area less than the
requirements set forth in this Code.

1252.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   In the enactment, execution and enforcement of this chapter, it is
recognized that there are certain uses which, due to the nature of their
operation, are recognized as having seriously objectionable operational
characteristics, particularly when several of said uses are concentrated in
close proximity to each other, thereby having a detrimental effect upon the
surrounding areas. The regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that the
detrimental effects will not contribute to the blighting, downgrading or other
diminution of property values of the surrounding neighborhood. The primary
purpose of this chapter is to prevent a concentration of these uses in any one
area. Uses subject to these controls are:
   (a)   An adult book store;
   (b)   An adult motion picture theater;
   (c)   An adult peep show;
   (d)   A massage establishment; and

CHAPTER 1270
Riparian Setbacks
1270.01   Intent and scope.
1270.02   Purpose.
1270.03   Establishment of designated watercourses and riparian setbacks.
1270.04   Permitted uses.
1270.05   Prohibited uses in riparian setbacks.
1270.06   Variances.
1270.07   Inspection of the riparian setback.
1270.08   Boundary interpretation and appeals procedure.
1270.01   INTENT AND SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to all lands within the Village, lands that border
designated watercourses, development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, property subdivision/
property/parcel splits, industrial projects, commercial projects, building
activities on farms, redevelopment of urban areas, site plan approvals, land
development plan approvals, all building permits which involve soil-disturbing
activities, and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This chapter
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land disturbing activities related to production of agricultural crops
or silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment
Pollution Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio
Administrative Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (b)   Strip mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter 1513 and
existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (c)   Surface mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter 1514 and
existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
(Ord. 2014-119. Passed 2-11-15; Ord. 2017-31. Passed 5-10-17.)
1270.02   PURPOSE.
   The specific purpose of this chapter is to regulate uses and developments
within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian and wetland
areas to:
   (a)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity of
floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
   (b)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion
and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
   (c)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
   (d)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming, and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter
watercourses.
   (e)   Benefit the Village economically by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to the
scenic beauty and environment of the Village, and thereby preserving the
character of the Village, the quality of life of the residents of the Village,
and corresponding property values.
(Ord. 2014-119. Passed 2-11-15; Ord. 2017-31. Passed 5-10-17.)
1270.03   ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   Designated watercourses and riparian setbacks are established in the Village
as follows:
   (a)   Stream Types. The following stream types shall be used to define
appropriate stream buffers:
   Table A: Stream Types
 
Stream Types
Stream Type Stream Characteristics
Type I      Drainage area of up to 32 acres
Type II     Drainage area of greater than 32 acres up to 0.5 square miles
Type III    Drainage area greater than 0.5 square miles up to 20 square miles
Type IV     Drainage area greater than 20 square miles up to 300 square miles
Type V      Drainage area greater than 300 square miles
 
   (b)   Buffer Types and Allowed Activities. Any applicable buffer type
boundaries shall be indicated on any plat or site plan files which includes an
applicable stream corridor. The following buffer types shall
be used to regulate activities in any stream corridor buffers:
   Table B: Buffer Types
 
Buffer Type                Buffer Characteristics
                           An area that protects the physical and ecological
                           integrity of the stream ecosystem. It is the most
                           sensitive area of the stream corridor and includes
Preserved buffer           the stream channel and the required setback from the
                           ordinary high water mark. In order to protect
                           natural functions of the corridor, this area should
                           contain undisturbed natural vegetation.
                           An area that protects key components of the stream,
                           provides distance, and transitions between up land
                           development and preserved buffer. Activities in this
                           area impact the function of the preserved buffer, as
Managed buffer             well as the stream corridor, and it begins
                           immediately adjacent to the preserved buffer. In
                           order to protect natural function of the corridor,
                           this area should contain native vegetation and
                           limited land disturbance.
                           An area that prevents encroachment into the steam
                           corridor by more intense and conventional
                           development. Activities in this area impact the
                           function of the stream corridor, and it begins
Limited development buffer immediately adjacent to the managed buffer. Limited
                           development activity is allowed in this area,
                           provided it is accessory to a use in one of the
                           other buffer areas or involves site design practices
                           that eliminate, minimize, or mitigate impacts of
                           run-off into the stream corridor.
 
   (c)   Required Buffer Area. The required buffer area shall be according to
the following table with required and allowed modifications based upon the
following sections and Table C.
    Table C: Required Buffer Areas
 
               Buffer Type

disturbing less than one acre must be considered if that construction activity
is part of a larger common plan of development or sale that would disturb one
acre or more.
   (b)   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated
projects involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions,
industrial projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms,
redevelopment of urban areas, and all other land uses not specifically
exempted.
   (c)   This chapter does not apply to:
      (1)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops
or agricultural operations regulated by Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 1501:15-
3-01 to 1501:15-309, Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
      (2)   Existing strip mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter
1513.
      (3)   Existing surface mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter
1514(c).
   (d)   Final approval of a proposed development, redevelopment, street or
utility project shall not be given unless:
      (1)   A determination is made by the Village Engineer based on submission
of a site development plan as detailed in Section
1272.03 that the proposed earth disturbing activity will minimize accelerated
runoff, erosion, and/or sediment.
      (2)   A SMP has been approved by the Village Engineer that determines
that the proposed earth disturbing activity will not cause accelerated runoff,
erosion, and/or sediment.
   (e)   Any person or persons seeking approval to construct a structure shall
be exempted from having to prepare a Site Development Plan and a SMP provided
they meet all of the following:
      (1)   Construction takes place on one parcel.
      (2)   The earth disturbing activity does not affect more than one acre of
the development site at a time.
      (3)   The activity is not located within a floodplain or floodway as
identified by FEMA.
      (4)   The parcel is part of an overall development plan which has
received approval of a SMP and the developer certifies that they will comply
with said Plan.
(Ord. 2014-119. Passed 2-11-15; Ord. 2017-31. Passed 5-10-17.)
1272.02   COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   Plan Required.
   (a)   An applicant shall develop a Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan
describing how the quantity and quality of storm water will be managed after
construction is complete for every discharge from the site and/or into a water
resource or a small municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). The
comprehensive plan developed to comply with this regulation will be coordinated
and combined with the riparian plan and the post-construction water quality
plan that are developed for the same site. These plans together will be part of
the overall Storm Water Management Plan that will be submitted for the site.
The comprehensive storm water management plan so developed will serve as the
storm water pollution prevention plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of
the NPDES storm water permit for general construction.
   (b)   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-
sediment pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands. It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of
contractor(s) responsible for implementation of the SWP3 and providing that
information to the Village Engineer.

shall be undertaken for any land disturbance equal to or greater than one acre
without an approved Site Development Plan as required under Section
1272.03 and a stormwater management plan (SMP) as required under this section.
The stormwater management plan may be amended if there is a change in design,
construction, operation, or maintenance which has a significant effect on the
potential for the discharge of pollutants to the surface waters of the State or
if the SMP proves to be ineffective in achieving the general objectives of
controlling the pollutants in stormwater discharge associated with construction
activity.

      (17)   Calculations for the design of stormwater management facilities
shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:
         A.   The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the site does not exceed the peak rate of runoff
from a one year frequency, twenty-four-hour storm occurring on the same site

the critical storm, shall have a proposed peak rate of runoff less than the
existing peak rate of runoff.
         C.   The overflow spillway elevation shall be set one foot above the
100-year storm elevation and the surrounding berm elevation shall set minimally
one foot higher than the overflow spillway.
      (18)   Calculation of a critical storm for each subdrainage unit of the

         C.   The Village Engineer shall approve or reject any calculation
method based on its technical validity for the given situation. Downstream
capacity may further reduce maximum discharge requirements.
   (e)   Stormwater Management Facility Design Criteria.
      (1)   Runoff from all drainage area tributary to the stormwater

(Ord. 2014-119. Passed 2-11-15; Ord. 2017-31. Passed 5-10-17.)
1272.07   MAINTENANCE.
   Maintenance of permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including on-
site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, shall
be performed in accordance with the Village Manual.
(Ord. 2014-119. Passed 2-11-15; Ord. 2017-31. Passed 5-10-17.)
1272.08   MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area, shall use conservation planning
and practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the
following standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days. Non-
structural preservation measures are also available. The SWP3 must make use of
such practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas,
preserving the existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at
any one time, minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree
preservation areas or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil
compaction shall be minimized and unless infeasible, topsoil shall be
preserved. Provide and maintain a fifty-foot buffer of undisturbed natural
vegetation around surface waters of the State, or riparian or wetland setbacks,
if applicable, whichever is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is
infeasible (e.g., stream crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and
floodplain rehabilitation and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated
areas to increase sediment removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria in Rainwater
and Land Development.
   (c)   Sediment Barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt
fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to silt fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area. The design, installation, and maintenance of erosion and
sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity, and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum Drainage Area (in Acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Particular
Linear Feet of Silt Fence Based on      Drainage Area
Slope
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    ≥ 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   ≥ 20% but < 50%
 
      This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to
control sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier
shall not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw bale
barriers are not acceptable. Detail drawings and plan notes shall specify the
diameter of filter socks, compost berms, and other such alternative perimeter
controls if used instead of silt fence.
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices. Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains, and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling pond.
Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations and along
the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive flow velocity from the
structure to a water course so that the natural, physical, and biological
characteristics and functions are maintained and protected. Concentrated
stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands shall be converted to diffuse
flow through the use of level spreaders or other such appropriate measures
before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flows should be released so no
erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may be needed in series to ensure
non-erosive velocities.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first
phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil
erosion, sediment, and storm water control BMPs. After the perimeter controls
are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing
may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices. Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls, and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days
from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently re-stabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
   Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent

                                        instability or are otherwise
                                        prohibited, alternative stabilization
                                        techniques must be employed.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather or
winter.                                 November 1st, whichever occurs first.
 
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds. A sediment settling pond is required for any
one of the following conditions:
      (1)   Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
      (2)   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of
silt fence or other sediment barriers;
      (3)   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of inlet
protection; or
      (4)   Runoff from common drainage locations with ten or more acres of
disturbed land. Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in
writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner
demonstrated to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (5)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include five or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
      (6)   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than ten
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (7)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1,800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1,000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principle) spillway.
      (8)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least forty-eight hours, or
meet the criteria in the Ohio Rain Water and Land Development Manual, whichever
is most stringent.
      (9)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width; a length to width radio of 4:1 is recommended.
      (10)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond
must be less than or equal to five feet.
      (11)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by forty percent.
      (12)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (13)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
      (14)   The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirement of
sediment basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the
pond provides an equivalent or better sediment storage and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a sediment settling
pond and is exempted in writing by the Village Engineer and thereafter approved
by Village Council. In areas where construction will be ongoing, such as
subdivisions, the storm sewer protection shall be maintained until all up slope
areas reach final stabilization, as determined by the Village Engineer. Streets
and catch basins shall be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Straw, hay
bales, and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (2)   All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one or more
acres will require a sediment settling pond.
      (3)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
and videotape the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer. All
sediments shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
The Village shall be provided with two copies of the videotape.
   (k)   Storm Sewer & Other Drainage Outlets. All storm sewers, footer drains,
roof gutter drains, and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom of the
slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water being
drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion of the
stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water is
outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near or Crossing Streams and Wetlands.
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or other material shall be dumped or placed
into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip, or erode
into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by the
approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps of Engineers and
Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams setbacks required by the community will be implemented in
accordance with
Chapter 1270.
      (6)   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of one foot of a box culvert
or pipe arch must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or conveyance
must be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
   (m)   Construction Entrance.
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public roads
or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Village Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned and
installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the Ohio
Rain Water and Land Development Manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils.
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the Cuyahoga County Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may require detailed soil reports when deemed
necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled, or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions, and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 3:1,
or as otherwise approved by the Village Engineer.
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels. Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at
discharge locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-
erosive velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural
physical and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and
protected.
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, has eighty percent
vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover,
and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The construction
maintenance guarantee shall not be released by the Village until all temporary
soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed have been
removed, properly disposed of, and any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction. The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days;
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state; and
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water, care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections.
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
calendar days, and within twenty-four hours of a 0.5 inch or greater rainfall
event until the maintenance organization obtains certification reflecting the
site's stability from the Village's Engineer. Such certification does not
relieve the permittee from meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.). A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented.
      (4)   Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and signed
by the qualified inspection personnel representative and submitted to the
Village Engineer. At a minimum, the inspection report must include:
         A.   The inspection date;
         B.   Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection;
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection
including the timing, duration, and depth of any storms;
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of the inspection;
         E.   Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from
the site;
         F.   Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained;
         G.   Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location;
         H.   Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist
at the time of the inspection; and,
         I.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
comprehensive storm water management plan and implementation dates.
      (5)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the SMP shall be
observed to ensure that they are operating correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   Sensitive areas including riparian and wetland setbacks shall be
observed to ensure that they remain well marked and undisturbed.
      (11)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the
inspection.
      (12)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the Construction Site Conservation Plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection. The
amended plan must be submitted to, and approved by, the Village Engineer prior
to installation of the new control practice.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten days from the date of inspection.
      (14)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Inspection and Maintenance Agreement. The inspection and maintenance
agreement required for SCMs under this regulation as a stand-alone document
between the Village and the applicant. A copy of this agreement should be
attached to the property deed. The agreement shall contain the following
information and provisions:
      (1)   Identification of the landowner(s), organization, or municipality
responsible for long-term inspection and maintenance, including repairs, of the
SCMs.
      (2)   The landowner(s), organization, or municipality shall maintain SCMs
in accordance with this regulation.
      (3)   The Village has the authority to enter upon the property to conduct
inspections as necessary, with prior notification of the property owner, to
verify that the SCMs are being maintained and operated in accordance with this
regulation.
      (4)   The Village shall maintain public records of the results of site
inspections, shall inform the landowner(s), organization, or municipality
responsible for maintenance of the inspection results, and shall specifically
indicate in writing any corrective actions required to bring the SCMs into
proper working condition.
      (5)   If the Village notifies the landowner(s), organization, or
municipality responsible for maintenance of the maintenance problems that
require correction, the specific corrective actions shall be taken within a
reasonable time as determined by the Village.
      (6)   The Village is authorized to enter upon the property and perform
the corrective actions identified in the inspection report if the landowner(s),
organization, or municipality responsible for maintenance does not make the
required corrections in the specified time period. The Village shall be
reimbursed by the landowner(s), organization, or municipality responsible for
maintenance for all expenses incurred within ten days of receipt of invoice
from the Village, or more with written approval from the Village Engineer.
      (7)   The method of funding long-term maintenance and inspections of all
SCMs.
      (8)   A release of the Village from all damages, accidents, casualties,
occurrences, or claims that might arise or be asserted against the Village from
the construction presence, existence, or maintenance of SCMs.
   (v)   Inspection and Maintenance Plan. This plan will be developed by the
applicant and reviewed by the Village. Once the Inspection and Maintenance Plan
is approved, a recorded copy of the Plan must be submitted to the Village as
part of the final inspection approval. The plan will include at a minimum:
      (1)   The location of each SCM and identification of the drainage area
served by each SCM.
      (2)   Photographs of each SCM, including all inlets and outlets upon
completion of construction.
      (3)   Schedule of inspection.
      (4)   A schedule for regular maintenance for each aspect of the
stormwater management system and description of routine and non-routine
maintenance tasks to ensure continued performance of the system as is detailed
in the approved Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan. A maintenance
inspection checklist written so the average person can understand it shall be
incorporated. The maintenance plan will include a detailed drawing of each SCM
and outlet structures with the parts of the outlet structure labeled. This
schedule may include additional standards, as required by the Village Engineer,
to ensure continued performance of SCMs permitted to be located in, or within
fifty feet of, water resources.
      (5)   The location and documentation of all access and maintenance
easements on the property.
      (6)   Alteration or termination of these stipulations is prohibited.
   (w)   Control of Materials and Debris. Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Village's and State's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum,
etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource is prohibited. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts. The discharge of washout and cleanout of stucco, paint, form release
oils, curing compounds, and other construction materials to a street, catch
basin, other public facility, natural resource or waters of the State is
prohibited. The discharge of soaps or solvents used in vehicle and equipment
washing is also prohibited. If generated, these wastewaters must be collected
and disposed of properly.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110 percent of the volume of the largest container in the storage area
and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up spills. The SWP3 shall contain
spill prevention and response procedures and these procedures shall be
discussed at the pre-construction meeting. All additional requirements of the
local fire authority must be followed. If the fuel tanks have a self-contained
“dike,” the plug will be kept in the “dike” tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. The
discharge of fuels, oils, and other pollutants used in vehicle and equipment
operation and maintenance is prohibited.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints, and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable State regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water-based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate Federal, State, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant. Where construction activities are to occur on sites with
contamination from previous activities, operators shall be aware that
concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not considered a
hazardous waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards)) may still
result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality Standards. Such
discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures which may be
utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to: May 2016 24
i. Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff and
prevent discharge. ii. Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary
sewer with the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump
into a container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal
facility; and iii. Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or
other such methods to prevent storm water from coming into contact with
contaminated materials. The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure
of building materials, building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape
materials, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste
to precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, safety response plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
   (x)   Pre-winter Stabilization. If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Village Engineer and anyone else requested by the Village Engineer
to the meeting.
   (y)   Storm Water Basins.
      (1)   Pool geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1.
      (2)   Riser in embankment. The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Principal spillway. Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (4)   Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Village Engineer and thereafter approved by Village Council.
      (5)   Embankments. Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the ODNR and NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the
county that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for
all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Safety features.
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three percent, which
extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum
of twenty-five feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and
maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may
be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water
pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one foot
vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of fifteen inches below
the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to
prevent access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one
foot vertical) or as otherwise approved by the Village Engineer.
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 and shall
terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rain Water and Land Development Manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for Cuyahoga County, or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent.
   (z)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Village to impose at any time additional, more stringent requirements,
nor shall the standards limit the right of the Village to waive, in writing,
individual requirements.
   (aa)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS.
   (bb)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes shall be those that are specified in the Village Manual.

1420.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBC, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,

conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

prevent the Building Commissioner from thereafter requiring a correction of
errors in plans or in construction, or a correction of violations of this
Building and Housing Code or of other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or
regulations. The Commissioner shall not incur any personal liability or expense
upon the Village, nor shall the Commissioner or the Village be estopped to

be allowed in writing by the Building Commissioner.
   (b)   Upon issuing a building permit, the Building Commissioner shall fix
the reasonable time necessary to complete the building work, taking into

the Building Department. No building shall be used or occupied until
completion, in accordance with the plans, has been approved by the Building
Department.
   Every building shall be completed in accordance with the plans within the
time fixed by the Building Commissioner on the building permit, and failure to

1442.11 TEMPORARY BUILDINGS.
   (a)   The construction of buildings or structures intended for temporary or

the applicant shall request further inspection by the Village Engineer, who
shall determine whether such foundation has been constructed in accordance with
the established grade. The Village Engineer shall not permit continuation of
construction beyond the foundation for any building if he or she finds that the
foundation has not been constructed in accordance with the established grade.

violation of or not in conformity with any provision of this Building and
Housing Code, the Building Commissioner may, in his or her discretion,

terminate any violation of this Building and Housing Code.
(1986 Code § 1311.03)
1450.04 REMEDIES.

1466.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Cuyahoga Heights, State of Ohio, does ordain the following Flood
Damage Prevention Regulations.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Cuyahoga Heights has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.05 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village as
identified in Section
1466.05(b), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Village.
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1466.10(a)(3) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall at 4863 East 71st Street,
Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio.
   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement, but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (d)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes.
   (e)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man- made
or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Cuyahoga Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (f)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.06 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood” means the flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or

chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) flood elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).

   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)” means issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally-assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood Insurance Risk Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions;
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1 -30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.

flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE)” is the base flood elevation plus
one foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodplain Administrator” means the Village Engineer, as appointed to
administer and implement the regulations of this Chapter 1466.
   (r)   “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (s)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (x)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (y)   “Manufactured home park” as specified in Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation, are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a “manufactured home park”, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (z)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (aa)   “New construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Cuyahoga Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 15, 1981, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (bb)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is farther defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (cc)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is: (1) built on a
single chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection; (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable
by a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (dd)   “Registered professional architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (ee)   “Registered professional engineer” means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Registered professional surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (gg)   “Special flood hazard area,” also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard” means it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. “Special flood hazard areas” may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The “actual start” means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ii)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (jj)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (kk)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as an
historic structure.
   (ll)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.08 MAP MAINTENANCE AND ACTIVITIES.
   (a)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Village of Cuyahoga Heights flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1466.05(b) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1466.10(a)(3).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1466.08(a)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1466.08(a)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.
   Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in
writing by the Mayor and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority
over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain
management regulations for a particular area. In order that the Village of
Cuyahoga Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the Village
suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new
area for which the Village has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (b)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard in the field. A person contesting the determination of the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in Section
1466.11, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.

      (9)   Assurance of flood-carrying capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood-
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
         A.   Development in floodways.
            1.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional
engineer, demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation; or
            2.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by
the applicant:
               a.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1466.08(a)(1);
               b.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
               c.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
               d.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
               e.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Cuyahoga Heights
and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the
proposed actions.
         B.   Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
            1.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA
where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
base flood elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or
            2.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified
by FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
               a.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
               b.   Section
1466.10(a)(9)A.2.a. and c. through e.
         C.   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
            1.   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the
issuance of a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a
description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated
as a result of the proposed development, and certification by a registered
professional engineer that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
            2.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
            3.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Cuyahoga Heights specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
            4.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1466.08(a)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.11 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of Cuyahoga Heights Board of Zoning Appeals (“Board”)
is hereby appointed to serve as the Board for these regulations as established
by Village Code.
      (2)   Records of the Board shall be kept and filed in Village Hall at
4863 East 71st Street, Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there
is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1466.11(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any party-in-interest affected by any notice and order, or
other official action of the Floodplain Administrator, may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Board, provided that such person
shall file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other
official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's
decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the
Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide the
appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Board shall have the power to authorize, in
specific cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not
inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary
hardship. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of this
chapter do not constitute an unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.   Any owner of property for which a variance is sought shall make
an application for a variance by filing it with the Floodplain Administrator,
who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to the Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon the following:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances,
as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1466.11(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedures at Hearings. The following shall apply to all hearings
under this chapter:
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A record of the proceedings shall be kept, except confidential
deliberations of the Board, including all documents presented.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator may present evidence or testimony in
opposition to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board's decision may be announced at the conclusion of the
hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in
writing within a reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board may
appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 2010-134. Passed 11-10-10.)
1466.12 ENFORCEMENT.

1482.01 PURPOSE.
   The specific purposes of this chapter are to:
   (a)   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential, commercial
and industrial districts.
   (b)   Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
institutions, businesses and industrial establishments.
   (c)   Control the size and location of signs so that such signs will be
aesthetically harmonious with their surroundings.
   (d)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment.
   (e)   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Building and
Housing Code.
   In establishing these purposes, the Village has determined that signs which
do not comply with these regulations (type, size, location, and limitation on
the number of signs) are a public nuisance. Unregulated signs are unduly
distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and thereby create a traffic hazard
and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public.

the Building Commissioner. The manner of construction, the location and the
dimensions of the signboard shall be subject to the approval of the Building
Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Signboards
promoting off-site advertising are expressly prohibited.

permittee shall comply with all applicable regulations of the Municipality
relating to such excavation or construction, including the payment of permit or
license fees.
      (2)   Location of Facilities.
         A.   Within forty-eight hours after any other franchisee, licensee,
permittee, or other entity to which the Municipality has granted permission to
conduct excavation activities notifies a permittee of a proposed street
excavation, the permittee shall, at the permittee's expense:
            1.   Mark on the surface all of its locatable underground
facilities within the area of the proposed excavation;
            2.   Notify the excavator of any unlocatable underground facilities
in the area of the proposed excavation; or
            3.   Notify the excavator that the permittee does not have any
underground facilities in the vicinity of the proposed excavation.
         B.   In the event that all surfaces were accurately marked for
underground facilities as requested and the permittee's plant was cut or
damaged for whatever reason, then the entity responsible for causing such
damage shall be required to notify the permittee of such damage and pay for the
repair of the permittee's plant.
      (3)   Restoration of Streets.
         A.   Whenever a permittee disturbs the surface of any street for any
purpose, the permittee shall promptly restore the street to at least its prior
condition to the satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer. When any opening is
made by a permittee in a hard surface pavement in any street, the permittee
shall promptly refill the opening and restore the surface to a condition
satisfactory to the Municipal Engineer.
         B.   If the permittee excavates the surface of any street, the
permittee shall be responsible for restoration of the street and its surface
within the area affected by the excavation, in accordance with applicable
regulations of the Municipality and to the satisfaction of the Municipal
Engineer. The Municipality may, after providing notice and an opportunity to
correct to the permittee, refill and/or repave any opening made by the
permittee in the street, and the expense thereof shall be paid by the
permittee. The Municipality may, after providing notice and an opportunity to
correct to the permittee, remove and/or repair any work done by the permittee
which, in the determination of the Municipality, is inadequate. The cost
thereof, including the costs of inspection and supervision, shall be paid by
the permittee. All excavations made by the permittee in the streets shall be
properly safeguarded for the prevention of accidents. All of the permittee's
work under this chapter and this section, in particular, shall be done in
strict compliance with all rules, regulations and ordinances of the
Municipality.
      (4)   Maintenance and Workmanship.
         A.   A permittee's system shall be constructed and maintained in such
manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of
the Municipality or County, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits,
pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the
streets by, or under, the authority of the Municipality.
         B.   The permittee shall provide and use any equipment and appliances
necessary to control and carry the permittee's signals or other utilities so as
to prevent injury to the Municipality's property or property belonging to any
person. The permittee, at its own expense, shall repair, renew, change and
improve its facilities as listed above in good repair, and safe and presentable
condition.
      (5)   Acquisition of Facilities. Upon a permittee's acquisition of
facilities in any street in the Municipality, or upon the addition or
annexation to the Municipality of any area in which the permittee owns or
operates any facility, the permittee shall, at the Municipality's request,
submit to the Municipality a statement describing all facilities involved,
whether authorized by franchise, permit, license or other prior right, and
specifying the location of all such facilities to the extent the permittee has
possession of such information. Such facilities shall immediately be subject to
the terms of this Permit.
      (6)   Reservation of Municipal Street Rights. Nothing in this Permit
shall prevent the Municipality or public utilities owned, maintained and/or
operated by public entities other than the Municipality, from constructing
sewers; grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any street; laying down,
repairing or removing water mains; or constructing or establishing any other
public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as
practicable, so as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the use and operation of
the permittee's system. However, if any of the permittee's system interferes
with the construction or repair of any street or public improvement, including
construction, repair or removal of a sewer or water main, such portion of the
permittee's system shall be removed or replaced in the manner the Municipality
shall reasonably direct, and the Municipality shall in no event be liable for
any damage to any portion of the permittee's system. Any and all such removal
or replacement shall be at the expense of the permittee. Should the permittee
fail to remove, adjust or relocate its facilities by the date established by
the written notice of the Municipality to the permittee, the Municipality may
effect such removal, adjustment or relocation, and the reasonable expense
thereof shall be paid by the permittee, including all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by the Municipality due to the permittee's delay.
      (7)   Street Vacation. If any street or portion thereof used by the
permittee is vacated by the Municipality during the term of its permit, unless
the Municipality specifically reserves to the permittee the right to continue
its installation in the vacated street, the permittee shall, without delay or
expense to the Municipality, remove or discontinue its use of its facilities
from such street, and restore, repair or reconstruct the street where such
removal has occurred, and replace the street in the condition found. In the
event of the failure, neglect or refusal of the permittee, after a time period
to be negotiated by the Municipality and the permittee, to restore, repair or
reconstruct such street, the Municipality may do such work or cause it to be
done, and the cost thereof may be collected by the Municipality from the
performance bond of the permittee, if any.
      (8)   Discontinuing Use of Facilities. Whenever a permittee intends to
discontinue using any facility within the streets, the permittee shall submit
for the Municipality's approval a complete description of the facility and the
date on which the permittee intends to discontinue using the facility. The
permittee may remove the facility or request that the Municipality permit it to
remain in place. Notwithstanding the permittee's request that any such facility
remain in place, the Municipality may require the permittee to remove the
facility from above the street or modify the facility to protect the public
health, welfare, safety, and convenience, or otherwise serve the public
interest. The Municipality may require the permittee to perform a combination
of modification and removal of any such above-ground facility. The permittee
shall complete such removal or modification in accordance with a schedule set
by the Municipality and shall restore the area to a condition satisfactory to
the Municipality. Until such time as the permittee removes or modifies the
facility as directed by the Municipality, or until the rights to and
responsibility for the facility are accepted by another person having authority
to construct and maintain such facility, the permittee shall be responsible for
all necessary repairs and relocations of the facility, as well as maintenance
of the street, in the same manner and degree as if the facility were in active
use, and the permittee shall retain all liability for such facility.
      (9)   Hazardous Substances.
         A.   A permittee shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and

of hazardous substances has occurred, or may occur, from or related to the
permittee's system. In removing or modifying the permittee's facilities as
provided in this Permit, the permittee shall also remove all residue of
hazardous substances related thereto.
         C.   The permittee agrees to forever indemnify the Municipality
against any claims, costs and expenses, of any kind, nature and description,
whether direct or indirect, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the
Municipality arising out of the release of hazardous substances caused by the
permittee's system.
      (10)   Undergrounding of Cable. A permittee's existing facilities and
existing portions of the permittee's system shall be placed underground at the

purpose of placing, erecting, laying, maintaining, repairing, and removing
poles, conduits, supports for wires and conductors, and any other facility
needed for the maintenance or extension of the permittee's system as the
Municipality may, at its discretion, approve. All poles of the permittee shall
be erected between the curb and the sidewalk unless otherwise designated by the
proper authorities of the Municipality, and each pole shall be set whenever
practicable at an extension lot line. The Municipality shall have the right to
require the permittee to change the location of any permittee-owned pole,
conduit, structure or other facility within the streets when, in the opinion of
the Municipality, the public convenience requires such change, and the expense
thereof shall be paid by the permittee.

         D.   The final development map shall not be approved until the
developer submits evidence that:
            1.   It has notified each cable operator that underground utility
trenches are to open as of an estimated date, and that each cable operator will
be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to
individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and
conditions; and
            2.   It has received a written notification from each cable
operator that the cable operator intends to install its facilities during the
open trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms
and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and the cable
operator, or has received no reply from a cable operator within ten days after
its notification to such cable operator, in which case the cable operator will
be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the
open trench period.
         E.   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to compliance
with any applicable State regulatory agency and utility standards. If such
compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for
the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the
participating cable operators. With the concurrence of the developer, the
affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative installation
procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to
applicable law.

a manner as not to obstruct, injure, or prevent the free use and operation of
the poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances of the
permittee's system. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any person or entity
from liability arising out of the failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid
interfering with the permittee's system facilities while performing the public
works.
         B.   If any equipment of the permittee shall interfere with public
works, then, upon receipt of the notice, that part of the equipment of the
permittee which interferes shall be removed or replaced by the permittee in
such manner as shall be directed by the Municipality so that the same shall not
interfere with the public works as reasonably determined by the Municipality,
and the permittee shall bear the reasonable expense of such removal or
replacement.
      (29)   Notice. Except in the case of an emergency involving public safety
or service interruption to a large number of subscribers, the permittee shall
give reasonable notice to the property owners or legal tenants prior to
entering upon any private premises, and said notice shall specify the work to
be performed. If any damage is caused by any permittee activity or omission,
the permittee shall reimburse the property owner the reasonable cost of the
damage or replace the damaged property. For installation of pedestals or other
major construction or installation projects, property owners shall also be
notified by mail at least one week in advance. In the case of an emergency (as

improvements that the Municipality may deem appropriate to make or to interfere
in any manner with the rights of any property owner, or to unnecessarily hinder
or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
         G.   The permittee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall
install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices preventing
failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injury or nuisance to
the public.
      (31)   Trimming of Trees.
         A.   The permittee shall have the authority to trim trees, at its sole
cost, in accordance with all applicable utility restrictions and ordinance and
easement restrictions, upon and hanging over streets, alleys, sidewalks, and
public places of the Municipality so as to prevent the branches of such trees
from coming in contact with the wires and cables of the permittee. Municipal
representatives shall have authority to supervise and approve all trimming of
trees conducted by the permittee.
         B.   Except in emergencies, the permittee may not prune trees at a
point below thirty feet above sidewalk grade until one week after written
notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the
street in or over which the tree is growing. For purposes of this section,
emergencies exist when it is necessary to prune to protect the public from
imminent danger of immediate interruption of cable signal. The owner or
occupant shall have seven days from the receipt of the permittee's notice to
arrange for an outside contractor to prune the tree, at his or her own expense.
If the owner or occupant fails to do so, the permittee may prune such tree at
its own expense.
      (32)   Use of Facilities by Municipality. The Municipality shall have the
right to install and maintain, free of charge, upon the poles and within the
underground pipes and conduits of the permittee, any wires and fixtures desired
by the Municipality, to the extent that such installation and maintenance do
not unreasonably interfere with existing operations of the permittee and are in
accordance with other governmental regulations.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.06 ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION.
   (a)   Authority. The Municipality expressly reserves, and the permittee
expressly recognizes, the Municipality's right and duty to adopt, from time to
time, in addition to the provisions herein contained, such Charter provisions,
resolutions, ordinances and rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary by
the Municipality in the lawful exercise of its police power for the protection
of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and their properties. The
Charter and the Codified Ordinances of the Municipality, as the same may be
amended from time to time, are expressly incorporated, as if fully set out
herein, by this reference. The permittee shall comply with all Charter
provisions, resolutions, ordinances, rules and regulations of the Municipality
and shall obtain all required permits. All permittees who are also franchisees
under a cable television franchise granted by the Municipality shall further
comply with all requirements contained in the cable franchise agreement and the
master cable television regulatory ordinance. Any failure of the permittee to
comply with the requirements of the Municipality described herein shall
constitute an evasion of obligations under this Permit, and shall be
prohibited. The Municipality reserves the right to delegate any of its rights
or obligations under this Permit, without the consent of the permittee, to any
person, organization or official.
   (b)   Coordination and Environmental Impact. Except for emergencies, the
Municipality may require that all construction and installations be coordinated
with the Municipality's street improvement programs. In addition, the permittee
shall assess and report on the impact of its proposed construction on the
Municipal environment. Such reports may be reviewed by the Municipality to
ensure, inter alia, (i) that all applicable laws, including building and zoning
codes and air and water pollution regulations, are complied with, (ii) that
aesthetic and good planning principles have been given due consideration, and
(iii) that adverse impact on the environment has been minimized. The permittee
shall incorporate reasonable changes requested by the Municipality.
   (c)   Construction and Restoration. All streets, public property, and
lawfully installed improvements therein which are distributed by the
permittee's activity shall be restored to the Municipality's satisfaction in
the time frame prescribed by the Municipality, or if not prescribed by the
Municipality, as soon as possible (in no circumstances more than thirty days
from the date of completion of construction) by the permittee, at its expense,
to, at a minimum, the condition which existed prior to construction, to the
Municipality's satisfaction. In the event replacement and restoration of the
area is not completed within thirty days or as soon as reasonably possible, the
Municipality may, upon written notice to the permittee, complete any necessary
work at the sole expense of the permittee.
   (d)   Undergrounding. Except where noted in the Exhibits attached to
original Ordinance 1997-122, passed November 12, 1997, and specifically
authorized by the Municipality prior to construction, all of the permittee's
facilities shall be installed underground and all installation of street
crossings shall be made by boring. The permittee shall make no open cuts
without specific prior written permission of the Municipal Engineer or his or
her designee. Additionally, any facilities not installed underground must be
expressly authorized beforehand by the Municipality in writing, and so located
that any interference with the other uses of the streets and other public
properties, and any interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of
property owners whose property adjoins any of the streets and other public
properties, are minimal. No underground installation shall be made in any
public right-of-way without having first obtained a street cut or other permit
from the Municipality and complying with the Municipality's bonding
requirements.
   (e)   Alternative Burial Standards. In cases where the burial standards of
Section
1483.05(24) do not apply, the minimum burial depth for the permittee's
underground facilities shall be two feet, or such other depth as approved by
the Municipality, with warning tape buried above all fiber optic cable, conduit
or lines to reduce the potential for accidental breakage and to minimize
actions under the hold harmless provision of Section
1483.08(a).
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.07 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   (a)   Open Records. The permittee shall manage all of its operations in
accordance with a policy of keeping its records open and accessible to the
Municipality. The Municipality shall have access to, and the right to inspect
at all reasonable times, any books and records of the permittee and affiliated
entities which are reasonably related to the administration or enforcement of
the terms of this Permit. The permittee shall not deny the Municipality access
to any of the permittee's records on the basis that the permittee's records are
under the control of any parent company, affiliated entity or a third party.
The Municipality may also, in writing, request copies of any such records or
books and the permittee shall provide such copies within thirty days of the
transmittal of such request, at the sole expense of the permittee. If the
requested books and records are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot
be copied or removed, then the permittee may request, in writing, within ten
days, that the Municipality inspect them at the permittee's local offices. If
any books or records of the permittee are not kept in a local metropolitan
office and copies are not made available to the Municipality upon written
request as set forth above, and if the Municipality determines that an
examination of such records is necessary or appropriate to the performance of
any of the Municipality's duties, audits, administration or enforcement of this
Permit, then all reasonable travel and maintenance expense(s) incurred in
making such examination shall be paid by the permittee. The requirements of
this section shall be in addition to any other similar sections contained in
other ordinances that affect the permittee.
   (b)   Confidentiality. The Municipality agrees to treat as confidential any
books or records that constitute proprietary or confidential information under
Federal or State law, to the extent the permittee makes the Municipality aware
of such confidentiality. The permittee shall be responsible for clearly and
conspicuously stamping the word "Confidential" on each page that contains
confidential or proprietary information, and shall provide a brief written
explanation why such information should be treated as confidential under State
or Federal law. If the Municipality receives a demand from any person for
disclosure of any information designated by the permittee as confidential, the
Municipality shall, so far as consistent with applicable law, advise the
permittee and provide the permittee with a copy of any written request by the
party demanding access to such information within a reasonable time. Nothing
herein shall alter the Municipality's obligation to comply with the Ohio Open
Records Act as the same may, from time to time, be amended.
   (c)   Public Filings.
      (1)   The permittee shall notify the Mayor of the Municipality, and
provide a copy, upon its request, of all FCC, Federal and State reports and
filings on behalf of the permittee or its affiliates which relate to the
operation of the system.
      (2)   All information furnished to the Municipality that is not subject
to confidential treatment under subsection (b) hereof is public information,
and shall be treated as such.
   (d)   Annual Reports. Within 120 days after the close of the permittee's
fiscal year, the permittee shall submit to the Municipality a written annual
report, in a form acceptable to the Municipality, which shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, the following information for the permit area:
      (1)   An expense statement certified by an officer of the permittee;
      (2)   A summary of the previous year's activities in development of the
system, including, but not limited to, services begun or discontinued during
the reporting year, and the number of users of the permittee's services;
      (3)   A statement of planned construction, if any, for the next two
years;
      (4)   A list of the permittee's officers, members of its Board of
Directors, and other principals of the permittee; and
      (5)   A list of stockholders, or other equity investors holding five
percent or more of the voting interest in the permittee and its parent,
subsidiary and affiliated corporations and other entities, if any, unless the
parent is a public corporation whose annual reports are publicly available, in
which case a copy of the annual report shall be submitted.
   (e)   Plant Survey Report. At the Municipality's request, including, but not
limited to, requests based on customer complaints or the Municipality's own
experience with the facilities, the permittee shall submit to the Municipality,
within thirty days of the request, unless such time is extended by the
Municipality, a plant survey report, which shall be a survey of the permittee's
plant within all or portions of the permit area as specified by the
Municipality, and a full report thereon. Said report shall include, but not be
limited to, an appropriate engineering evaluation of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system, including, but not limited to, any suitable
electronic measurements conducted in conformity with such requirements,
including supervision, as the Municipality may prescribe. Said report shall be
in sufficient detail to enable the Municipality to ascertain that the same meet
service requirements and all applicable Federal, State and local construction,
operational and technical performance standards. At the Municipality's request,
but not more than once per year, the permittee and the Municipality shall agree
upon the appointment of a qualified independent engineer to evaluate and verify
the performance of the system. Subject to the prior appropriation of funds
therefor, the cost of the evaluation shall be borne equally by the permittee
and the Municipality, unless the independent engineer determines that the
system fails to meet applicable standards, in which case the permittee shall
reimburse the Municipality for all costs of the evaluation.
   (f)   Failure to Report. The failure or neglect of the permittee to file any
of the reports or filings required under this Permit, or such other reports as
the Municipality may reasonably request, may, at the Municipality's option, be
deemed a breach of this Permit.
   (g)   False Statements. Any intentional false or misleading statement or
representation in any report required by this Permit may be deemed a breach of
this Permit and may subject the permittee to all remedies, legal or equitable,
which are available to the Municipality under this Permit or otherwise.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.08 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (a)   Indemnification.
      (1)   The permittee shall construct, maintain and operate its facilities
in a manner which provides protection against injury or damage to persons or
property. The permittee, for itself and its related entities, agents, employees
and subcontractors, and the agents and employees of said subcontractors, shall
save the Municipality harmless, defend and indemnify the Municipality, its
successors, assigns, officers, employees, agents and appointed and elected
officials, from and against all liability or damage and all claims or demands
whatsoever in nature, and reimburse the Municipality for all its reasonable
expenses, including attorney fees, as incurred, arising out of the installation
and operation of the permittee's system within the streets and rights-of-way,
including, but not limited to, the actions of the permittee, its employees,
agents, contractors, related entities, successors and assigns, or the securing
of and the exercise by the permittee of the permit rights granted in this
Permit, including any third party claims, administrative hearings, actions for
copyright infringement and litigation, whether or not any act or omission
complained of is authorized, allowed, or prohibited by this Permit. The terms
of each contract awarded by the permittee for activities pursuant to this
Permit shall contain indemnity provisions whereby the contractor shall
indemnify the Municipality to the same extent as described above.
      (2)   The permittee shall pay, and by its acceptance of this Permit
agrees to pay, all actual expenses incurred by the Municipality in defending
itself with regard to all damages and penalties arising in any way out of the
exercise of any rights granted hereunder. In the event the Municipality
institutes litigation against the permittee for a breach of this Permit or for
an interpretation of this Permit, and the Municipality is the prevailing party,
the permittee shall reimburse the Municipality for all costs related thereto,
including reasonable attorney fees.
   (b)   Notice. Within thirty days after receipt of the same by the Law
Director, the Municipality will provide notice to the permittee of the
assertion of any claim or action arising out of the exercise by the permittee
of its Permit rights. The permittee will be permitted, at its own expense, to
appear and defend or assist in the defense of such claims. The permittee shall
have no recourse whatsoever against the Municipality for or on account of any
loss, cost, expense or damage arising out of the provisions or requirements of
this Permit, or the grant of the permit.
   (c)   Certificate of Insurance.
      (1)   At the time of the execution of this Permit, and annually
thereafter, the permittee shall provide to the Municipality, in accordance with
the provisions hereof, a certificate of insurance. The permittee shall maintain
public liability and property damage insurance that protects the permittee and
the Municipality, its officers, agents, employees and appointed and elected
officials, from any and all claims for damages or personal injury, including
death, and demands, actions and suits brought against any of them arising from
operations under this Permit or in connection therewith, in accordance with the
subsections below. Coverage during construction shall include those hazards
normally identified as X.C.U. This insurance coverage constitutes a minimum
requirement and shall in no way be deemed to lessen or limit the liability of
the permittee, related entities, its successors or assigns, under the terms of
this revocable Permit.
      (2)   The certificate of insurance shall be with a company licensed to do
business in the State of Ohio with a rating by Best of not less than "A". This
liability insurance shall include, but shall not be limited to, protection
against claims arising from bodily and personal injury and damage to property,
resulting from the permittee's automobiles, products and operations. The
insurance shall provide coverage at all times for not less than five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) for bodily injury to any one person and one million
dollars ($1,000,000) bodily injury in the aggregate per single accident or
occurrence and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for damage to any
single property, and one million dollars ($1,000,000) for property damage in
the aggregate per single accident or occurrence, plus costs of defense, or in
such other amounts as are acceptable to the Municipality and as provide
substantially equivalent coverage. The following endorsements shall attach to
the liability policy:
         A.   The policy shall cover personal injury as well as bodily injury.
         B.   The policy shall cover blanket contractual liability, subject to
the standard universal exclusions of contractual liability included in the
carrier's standard endorsement as to bodily injuries, personal injuries and
property damage.
         C.   Broad form property damage liability shall be afforded.
         D.   The Municipality and its elected officials, officers, agents and
employees shall be named as additional insureds on the policy. Notwithstanding
the naming of additional insureds, the insurance shall protect each insured in
the same manner as though a separate policy had been issued to each, but
nothing herein shall operate to increase the insurer's liability as set forth
elsewhere in the policy beyond the amount or amounts for which the insurer
would have been liable if only one person or interest had been named as
insured. The coverage must apply as to claims between insureds on the policy.
         E.   Standard form of cross-liability shall be afforded.
         F.   The policy shall not be canceled or materially altered so as to
be out of compliance with the requirements of this section, without thirty days
written notice of such cancellation or alteration given to the Municipality.
      (3)   If the insurance is canceled or materially altered so as to be out
of compliance with the requirements of this section, the permittee shall
provide a replacement policy. The permittee agrees to maintain continuous
uninterrupted insurance coverage in the amounts required.
      (4)   The Municipality reserves the right to adjust the coverage limit
requirement upward in the event the statutory maximums applicable to local
governments are raised and that such increased coverage limit requirements are
equally applied to all other permittees of the Municipality.
      (5)   Any deductible or self-insured retention must be declared to the
Municipality.
      (6)   The permittee shall submit to and maintain on file with the
Municipality documentation of the required insurance, including a certificate
of insurance signed by the insurance agent and companies named, as well as all
properly executed endorsements. Said certificate shall be subject to the
approval of the Municipality as to the adequacy of the certificate and of the
insurance certified under the requirements of this section.
      (7)   Failure of the permittee to maintain adequate insurance as required
under this section shall be cause for immediate termination of the permit by
the Municipality.
      (8)   Nothing herein shall be in any way construed as a waiver on behalf
of the Municipality of any of the protections or provisions of the Ohio
Governmental Immunity Act, and the permittee shall ensure that in naming the
Municipality as an insured under this section, all insurance policies or
agreements shall specifically contain a non-waiver provision and shall not
impair said protection and provisions.
   (d)   Security.
      (1)   With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system, or any significant project to upgrade or rebuild
more than fifty percent of the telecommunications and/or other utility system,
the permittee shall provide to the Municipality a construction performance and
construction completion bond (hereinafter referred to as the construction
completion bond) with a surety reasonably approved by the Municipality's Law
Director, in an amount equal to ten percent of the applicable estimated
construction cost. Such amount shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars
($200,000). With respect to the initial construction of the telecommunications
and/or other utility system or the upgrade or rebuild project, when regular
subscriber service is available to seventy-five percent of occupied dwelling
units, the amount of the bond shall be reduced by fifty percent of the original
amount. On the one-year anniversary of the initial construction of the
telecommunications and/or other utility system or the upgrade or rebuild
project, as the case may be, the bond may be canceled.
      (2)   The permittee shall also deposit with the Municipality a surety
bond or letter of credit in the amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Law Director of the Municipality (hereinafter
referred to as the performance bond). The performance bond shall be available
to insure the faithful performance by the permittee of provisions of the
permit, other than with respect to construction, upgrading or rebuilding
projects covered herein, but including the obligation to remove the
telecommunications and/or other utility system upon revocation or termination
of the permit as set forth herein. The performance bond shall be maintained at
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) during the entire term of this Permit,
regardless of withdrawals which may be made under this section. In the event of
a default by the permittee in any of its obligations under this Permit, other
than completion of construction, which default is not cured within thirty days
after notice by the Municipality to the permittee of such default (or such
longer time as is necessary to cure, so long as the permittee commences to cure
within thirty days and diligently pursues cure), the Municipality may levy on
the performance bond upon notifying the permittee of the amount of such charge.
The rights reserved to the Municipality with respect to the performance bond
are in addition to all other rights of the Municipality, at law or in equity.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.09 REMOVAL OF FACILITIES; TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO MUNICIPALITY. 
   Upon revocation of this Permit, and no proposed assignee requests and
receives the Municipality's approval of a transfer of the permittee's
telecommunications and/or other utility system, and an assignment of this
Permit or grant of a new Permit, within a reasonable period of time, but in no
event more than ninety days after such termination, then the permittee shall
remove said telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities at the
permittee's expense. As an alternative to removal, the permittee may, subject
to the Municipality's approval, abandon its facilities in place and transfer
ownership of the installed telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities
to the Municipality. Nothing herein shall cause the Municipality to incur any
costs related to the removal of the permittee's facilities or the transfer of
ownership of said facilities to the Municipality.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.10 ASSIGNMENT OF PERMIT AND LEASE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   Municipality's Consent Required for Assignment. The permittee shall
not assign this Permit or any rights or obligations accorded the permittee
hereunder to any party without the prior written consent of the Municipality,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Further, the permittee agrees not to
assign any billing or collection functions under this Permit to a subsidiary or
parent without prior written notice to and written consent from the
Municipality, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Should the permittee
attempt to assign this Permit or its rights hereunder without the prior consent
of the Municipality, this Permit shall be subject to forfeiture or termination
as provided herein, unless such assignment is ratified by the Municipality for
any and all costs incurred, including attorney fees, resulting from any such
attempt to assign this Permit, in whole or part. A refusal by the Municipality
to approve an assignment of this Permit or the permittee's rights hereunder
shall be deemed reasonable, among other things, and without limitation, if and
insofar as it relates to any requirement or condition of the Municipality that
the proposed assignee cure any existing default of the permittee hereunder and/
or to any demonstration of the assignee's qualifications equivalent to
demonstrations of the permittee's qualifications required hereunder, including,
but not limited to, the technical and financial strength and operating
experience of the assignee.
   (b)   Lessee to Obtain Permit. The permittee shall not lease any of its
telecommunications and/or other utilities facilities, system capaMunicipality
system bandwidth or use of the streets, and rights-of-way in which such are
contained, to any persons or other entities providing telecommunications and/or
other utility services, without first ensuring that such persons have obtained

Municipality for the provision of such services, and without the prior written
consent of the Municipality.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.11 PERMIT REVOCATION.
   (a)   Permit Revocable. A permit hereby granted shall be revocable at any
time that the Council shall determine that the public convenience and necessity
or the public health, safety or general welfare requires such revocation or

right to revoke the same is hereby expressly reserved to the Municipality.
However, at a reasonable time prior to Council action upon such revocation or
proposed revocation, opportunity shall be afforded to the permittee, its
successors and assigns, to be present at a hearing to be conducted by the
Council upon such matters and thereafter to present its or their views and
opinions thereof and to present for consideration, actions or actions
alternative to the revocation of this Permit.
   (b)   Continued Obligations. The revocation of this Permit, for any reason,
shall not operate as a waiver or release of the permittee from any obligation
or any liability which arose or arises out of any act or failure to act
required under this Permit prior to termination.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.12 EQUAL OPPORTUNITY; SAFETY.
   (a)   Nondiscrimination. In all matters connected with this Permit, the
permittee shall not discriminate against any employee, subcontractor, customer,
client, or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, age, sex,

affirmative action guidelines in selecting employees, subcontractors, and
customers, and shall ensure that the employees, subcontractors, and customers

Commission of the State of Ohio, or the Municipality, whichever is more
restrictive.

1483.13 COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS.
   The permittee's telecommunications and/or other utilities system shall be
constructed, operated and maintained in accordance with all applicable Federal,
State and local standards and requirements. If the Municipality, or a qualified
independent engineer of the Municipality's choosing, determines at any time
that the permittee's system is not in compliance with applicable standards or
requirements and so notifies the permittee, then the permittee shall
immediately take appropriate remedial action and continue such action without
interruption until the system is in compliance.
(Ord. 1997-122. Passed 11-12-97.)
1483.14 EMERGENCY USE OF FACILITIES.
   The permittee shall, in the case of any Municipality, State, or national

Grading, Filling or Changing the Topography of Land
Section
1485.01   Statement of purpose.
1485.02   Prohibition of certain changes.
1485.03   Alteration of topography; permit required.
1485.04   Permitted fill material.
1485.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The removal of topsoil, trees and other vegetation, loam, sand, gravel,
rock, stone, clay and other similar substances from the land results in noise
and the creation of large quantities of dust, which prove obnoxious to
inhabitants in the vicinity thereof, creates erosion, drainage problems, swamps
and lakes, frequently results in damage to adjoining properties by disturbing
the substructure thereof, tends to have a disrupting effect on ground water
supplies, results in other similar dangers to public health and safety, results
in unsightly and blighted areas unfit for other and useful purposes, thus
retarding or preventing the development of desirable residential, commercial
and industrial areas, depressing property and other values in the neighborhood,
permanently destroying the land and leaving it almost valueless for any purpose
and creates the highway hazards of heavy trucks and other equipment on the
roads and the scattering of earth and debris thereon, and, unless properly
planned, regulated and supervised, has an adverse effect upon the public peace,
health, safety and general welfare.
(Ord. 2004-98. Passed 6-9-04.)

1490.01 TITLE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property
Maintenance Code of the Village of Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio.
   (b)   Scope. This chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of
standards for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning
units of all residential, retail, commercial and industrial structures and
buildings within the Village, including yard areas immediately contiguous
thereto. No provisions of this chapter shall, in any way, directly or
indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right of, any
owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by him or her in
such manner and form as he or she may determine appropriate, consistent with
other applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to visual problems
and deteriorated property values which may occasion incipient blighting
conditions within the Village. All matters of the interior use, occupancy or
habitation of any structure or building within the Village are specifically
excluded from the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.02 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing standards governing the maintenance, appearance and
exterior condition of all premises throughout the Village; to fix certain
responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents and managers of the same as
to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to authorize and
establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such premises; to fix
penalties for violations of this chapter; and to provide for the repair,
demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation, occupancy or
use. This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the
public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.03 FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Village various and
several structures, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto, which
are, or may become in the future, deteriorated or defective with respect to
exterior maintenance, or further, that such condition, including, but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance, the appearance of
the exterior of the premises, and the existence of exterior fire hazards and
unsanitary conditions, constitutes an immediate threat to the health, safety,
welfare and reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the Village.
It is further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, the exterior appearance of certain properties has
the further
effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating depressed neighborhood
groupings, and that if the same are not curtailed and corrected, the conditions
are likely to grow and spread and necessitate, in time, the expenditure of
large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same, and that by
reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the growth
of such blight may be prevented and the immediate neighborhood and property
values thereby maintained.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.04 APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential, nonresidential or mixed occupancy building and the land
on which it is situated, used or intended to be used for dwelling, commercial,
business or industrial occupancy shall comply with the provisions of this
chapter, whether or not such building shall have been constructed, altered or
repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter, and without regard to
any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy
of the building or premises, for the construction or repair of the building, or
for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities, prior to the
effective date of this chapter. This chapter establishes standards for the
initial and continued occupancy and use of all such structures and does not
replace or modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration or use of the building. Where there is a mixed occupancy,
residential or nonresidential use therein shall be nevertheless regulated by
and subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.05 CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance of the Village or law of the State, the
standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the
Village or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such
other ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.06 ENFORCEMENT; NOTICE AND APPEAL.
   (a)   Authority of Building Commissioner. The enforcement of any and all
provisions of this chapter is placed with the Building Commissioner, as
designated by the Mayor, and the Building Commissioner, together with such
additional enforcement officers as may be required, shall carry out and
effectuate all of the provisions herein.
   (b)   Inspection. All buildings and premises within the Village are subject
to exterior inspections from time to time by the Building Commissioner. Except
in case of emergency, such inspections shall be preceded by written notice of
the inspection given to the property owner at least forty-eight hours before
the inspection.
   (c)   Notice to Correct Violations.
      (1)   Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is found to
exist, the Building Commissioner shall cause a written notice of such violation
to be served upon the person responsible for the correction thereof. The notice
shall specify the violation committed and shall provide for a reasonable period
of time, not more than sixty days, to correct or abate the violation. In the
event that weather is a major consideration in correcting or abating a
violation, the Building Commissioner may extend the time set forth herein to
not less than an additional thirty days immediately following the occurrence of
appropriate weather conditions, such schedule being consistent with the weather
conditions.
      (2)   Notice may be served personally or by certified mail addressed to
the last known address of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof
at the usual residence of the person to be served. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on the outside front entrance
of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a final order as to these
administrative proceedings.
   (d)   Appeal.
      (1)   Within thirty days of the date of service of notice, any person
affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Board of Zoning
Appeals by filing a written request with the Clerk of the Board. The
Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty
days therefrom, and upon five days notice to the party and the Building
Commissioner, set the matter down for hearing. The Board may sustain, modify or
dismiss, in whole or in part, any action required to correct or abate the
violation set forth in the notice and shall issue an order incorporating its
determinations, and such order shall be a final order as to these
administrative proceedings, provided, however, that any order of modification
or dismissal shall be effective for two years following the date of issuance of
such order, and thereafter the subject matter of such order of modification or
dismissal may be amenable to further inspection, notice and appeal as set forth
herein.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Building
Commissioner shall not, in any material way, alter the standard of this
chapter, and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants,
or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent
premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of compelling an
expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare of the community
that might be derived therefrom.
   (e)   Application of Other Village Ordinances. No license or permit or other
certification of compliance with this chapter shall constitute a defense
against any violation of any other local ordinance applicable to any structure
of premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve any owner, manager or
resident from complying with any such other provision, nor any official of the
Village from enforcing any such other provision.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.07 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   The owner and manager of every single or multiple unit structure
within the Village shall be responsible for maintaining the exterior surface of
the same in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   The owner, manager and any adult resident of a single dwelling
structure within the Village shall be responsible for maintaining the yard area
immediately contiguous thereto in conformance with the provisions of Sections
1490.08 and 1490.11.
   (c)   Unless expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter, the
respective obligations and responsibilities imposed herein upon the owner and
manager, as distinguished from those of the residents, shall not be altered or
affected by an agreement or contract by and between any of the aforesaid, or
between them and other parties.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.08 GENERAL EXTERIOR MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The exterior surfaces and all exterior members of all structures
within the Village, be the same functional or aesthetic, shall be maintained in
good repair. Any exterior part or feature thereof having functional use shall
be capable of performing the use for which such part or feature was designed.

1490.09 EXTERIOR SURFACES; WINDOWS.
   (a)   All exterior surfaces of every structure within the Village shall be
maintained so as to resist decay or deterioration from any naturally occurring
cause. All exterior surfaces shall be covered with paint, finish or other
surface coating so as to prevent such decay or deterioration. An exterior wall
segment, facing or other distinguishable surface area, determined by the
Building Commissioner to have more than twenty-five percent of its total area
bare, peeling, flaking, pitted, corroded or otherwise deteriorated, shall be
surface coated. If the surface to be coated is a portion of a larger structure,
such surface coating shall be compatible in color, texture and design with the
entire structure. If the entire exterior surface of a structure is to be
surface coated, such surface coating shall be compatible in color, texture and
design with similar structures in the immediate neighborhood. If the entire
surface of any structure within the Village is to be surface coated, the
property owner must apply for a surface coating permit from the Building
Commissioner. The fee for a surface coating permit shall be five dollars
($5.00).
   (b)   All deteriorated or decayed exterior walls, doors, porches, floors,
steps, railings or parts or features thereof shall be repaired, removed or
replaced.
   (c)   All damaged or broken windows, and deteriorated or decayed sill, sash,

area comprised of missing or deteriorated shingles, or other roofing material,
shall be replaced.
   (b)   Roof drainage shall be handled by downspouts connected to a public
storm sewer and/or suitable collectors approved by the Village Engineer. Where
storm sewers or other storm drainage outlets are not available, downspouts may
discharge into splash blocks or other devices approved by the Village Engineer,
provided that no excess water will flow onto adjoining property or over
sidewalks. Connection of any pipe carrying roof drainage or yard drainage to a
sanitary sewer is prohibited.
   (c)   Any structure within the Village having gutters and/or downspouts in
place shall be maintained in such manner as to keep such gutters and/or
downspouts free of exterior rust and corrosion. Such rust and corrosion as may
develop in the course of ordinary use of the same shall be removed, painted or
otherwise surface coated so as to keep such gutters and/or downspouts free of
visible rust or corrosion.
   (d)   The chimney of every structure within the Village shall be maintained
structurally sound and in good repair, free of loose, missing or deteriorated
mortar, bricks or other chimney building materials. Any such loose, missing or
deteriorating mortar or bricks shall be refitted, replaced or repaired.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90; Ord. 2012-37. Passed 6-13-12.)

      (1)   No furniture (except lawn furniture in good repair), mattresses,
household furnishings, rugs, appliances, abandoned railroad ties, tires,
wheels, abandoned vehicle parts, dilapidated automobiles or automobile parts,
shall be placed or stored in any yard area contiguous to any structure within
the Village over a period in excess of twenty-four hours, provided, however,
that such of the items as are set forth herein which are usually and ordinarily
placed for Municipal refuse hauling may be so placed for a period of time not
to exceed the next regularly scheduled Municipal refuse hauling date.
      (2)   Exterior property areas of all premises shall be kept free of
debris, objects, materials or conditions that, in the opinion of the Building
Commissioner, create a health, accident or fire hazard, or are a public
nuisance, or constitute a blighting or deteriorating influence on the
neighborhood. Broken glass, stumps, filth, garbage, trash and debris shall not
be permitted on any property.
   (b)   Trees, Grass and Shrubbery.
      (1)   All trees, shrubs or plants shall be trimmed, and dead, decayed or

of the Building Commissioner, are a hazard to persons using the premises, shall
not be permitted. Driveways shall be maintained so as not to constitute a
blighting or deteriorating effect in the neighborhood.
   (e)   Portable Temporary Storage Units.
      (1)   A "portable temporary storage unit" is defined, for purposes of
this Section 1490.11, as a portable storage unit used to store or transport
personal or household belongings, office equipment, or other items. Such units
are commonly referred to as PODS.
      (2)   Location and duration of use.
         A.   No portable temporary storage unit shall be placed in any
location that obstructs the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic on a street
or sidewalk or impedes access to utilities or public services.
         B.   All portable temporary storage units must be placed on a paved or
graveled surface.
         C.   For properties located in zoning districts other than the General
Residence District, portable temporary storage units regulated under this
section shall be only those units not used for the conduct of the trade or the
business. In said districts, the portable temporary storage units shall be
placed in the rear of the principal building or structure. Subject to any
restrictions in the Building and Zoning Codes, if the property's side yard
cannot be readily observed from public streets and sidewalks, a portable
temporary storage unit may be placed on the property's side yard.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one portable temporary storage unit may be
placed in the driveway for the residence or in the front of the principal
building or structure for a period not to exceed 72 hours, which may be
extended up to an additional seven days for good cause, by written
authorization of the Building Commissioner.
         D.   For properties located in a General Residence District, all
portable temporary storage units shall be placed in the rear of the principal
building or structure if accessible by an existing driveway. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, one portable temporary storage unit may be placed in the
driveway for the residence or in the front of the principal building or
structure for a period not to exceed 72 hours, which may be extended up to an
additional seven days for good cause, by written authorization of the Building
Commissioner.
         E.   No portable temporary storage unit shall remain on any property
for a period of more than 30 days. Such period may be extended by written
authorization of the Building Commissioner, upon a showing of extenuating
circumstances, such as repair for fire damage.
         F.   No property shall have more than two portable temporary storage
units on the property at the same time, and each shall be no larger than ten
feet by 18 feet.

Passed 5-9-12; Ord. 2014-112. Passed 11-12-14; Ord. 2025-35. Passed 6-11- 25.)
1490.12 ABANDONED STRUCTURES AND UNOCCUPIED LOTS.
   (a)   If any structure shall become abandoned for a period of more than
ninety days, such structure shall be presumed to be a nuisance affecting or
endangering surrounding property values and to be detrimental to public health,
safety, convenience, comfort or property, or to the general welfare of the
community, and shall be abated. For purposes of this section, "abandon" means
to give up occupancy in the structure with the intent of never again claiming
occupancy in the structure.
   (b)   Whenever the Building Commissioner finds that any structure has been
abandoned, he or she shall give notice in the same manner as a summons is
served in civil cases or by certified mail addressed to the owner of record of
the premises at his or her last known address, or to the address to which tax
bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such
abandoned condition within thirty days either by placing the structure in
operation in accordance with this section, by adapting and using the structure
for another use permitted in the zoning district, or by razing the structure,
removing all debris, any signs, goods, supplies and equipment, and filling
depressions to the grade level for the lot, provided, however, that if the
structure is used after the notice is given and remains in operation for ninety
consecutive days, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
   (c)   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the
notice to abate such abandonment, the Building Commissioner shall advise the
Solicitor of all the facts and the Solicitor shall proceed to exercise on
behalf of the Village any remedy which shall then be available to it to secure
an abatement of such abandonment, including any that pertains to the abatement
of a public nuisance, and to recover any damages or enforce any penalties which
may be recovered or imposed at the instance of the Village, including all
damages reasonable under Ohio R.C. 715.26 and 715.261.
   (d)   Unoccupied, empty or inoperative structures, whether or not abandoned,
together with the lot upon which any such structure is located and with any
other unoccupied or empty lot, shall be maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter. Any such lot shall be provided with grass or other
appropriate ground cover or landscaping material so as to assure absorption of
rainfall and prevent erosion and rapid runoff of surface water. The owner shall
cut and maintain all grass or other ground cover and remove all rubbish and
weeds from the premises. The parking of motor vehicles upon such premises shall
be prohibited, and the Building Commissioner may order the owner of the
premises to install fencing approved by the Building Commissioner which will be
sufficient to block access of motor vehicles to such property.
(Ord. 1990-42. Passed 4-11-90.)
1490.13 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Whenever a person charged herein with the maintenance of a structure
or premises fails to comply with any final order as provided in this chapter,
the Solicitor shall institute an appropriate action at law.
   (b)   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter, or fails to comply
with any final order as provided herein, shall be subject to the penalty
provided in Section
1490.99.
1490.14 EXTERIOR INSPECTIONS.
   The Building Commissioner and/or his or her authorized representative shall
make, or cause to be made, biannual inspections of the exteriors of all
dwelling units, dwelling structures, residential premises, and secondary or
appurtenant structures thereon to determine whether or not such dwelling,
structures or premises conforms with the Building and Housing Code, including
this
Chapter 1490. Such inspections may also be made whenever the Building
Commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the Code
exists therein or thereon.
(Ord. 2008-156. Passed 8-13-08.)
1490.15 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   Upon presentation of proper credentials, the Building Commissioner and/or
his or her authorized representative may request entry to all property areas or
premises in the Village, at all reasonable times (or at such other times as may
be necessary in an existing emergency), to perform any duty imposed upon him or
her. If such entry is refused then entry may be had pursuant to a search
warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2008-156. Passed 8-13-08.)

related to the use or maintenance of the property or the dwelling structure,
including but not limited to notices and processes served in connection with
the enforcement of the Building and Housing Code. The authorized agent must
maintain a physical office in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, or must actually reside
within Cuyahoga County, Ohio. An owner who is a natural person and who meets
the requirements of this division (c) as to location of residence or office may
designate himself as agent. By designating an authorized agent under the
provisions of this Section
1492.25, the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of violations
of Village ordinances and to receive process, in any court proceeding or
administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or dwelling structure, including but not limited to proceedings
related to the enforcement of the Building and Housing Code, by service of the
notice or process on the authorized agent. Any owner who has designated an
authorized agent under the provisions of this section shall be deemed to
consent to the continuation of the agent's designation for the purpose of this
section until the owner notifies the Commissioner of Buildings in writing of a
change of authorized agent or until the owner files a new annual registration

   (d)   For purposes of this Section
1492.25, “vacant” means a structure which is lacking habitual presence of human
beings who have a legal right to be on the premises, or at which substantially
all lawful residential occupancy has ceased, or which is substantially devoid
of contents. In determining whether a dwelling structure is vacant, it is
relevant to consider, among other factors, the percentage of the overall square
footage of the structure or floor area to the occupied space, the condition and
value of any items in the structure and the presence of rental or for sale
signs on the property; provided that a dwelling structure shall not be deemed
vacant if it has been used as a residence by a person entitled to possession
for a period of at least three months within the previous nine-month period and
a person entitled to possession intends to resume residing at the property; and
further provided that a dwelling structure containing more than one dwelling
unit shall be considered vacant when all of the dwelling units within the
structure are vacant. If an owner fails to obtain a Certificate of Rental
Property Occupancy for any structure for which a Certificate of Rental Property
Occupancy is required pursuant to Section 1494.02, the structure will be
presumed vacant.

(s) of the dwelling structure, within 30 days after the effective date of this
Section
1492.26 or within 30 days after obtaining ownership of the dwelling structure,

structure to obtain a deed for the property or to file the deed with the County
Recorder shall not excuse the owner from compliance with this Section
1492.26.
   (b)   Any owner who has designated an authorized agent under the provisions
of this Section
1492.26 shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's

Commissioner is notified in writing that an owner of the dwelling structure is
now residing within Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and registration is no longer
required under this section.

1492.26 shall be fifty dollars ($50.00). The registration process under this
Section
1492.26 shall be the same as the registration process set forth in Section
1492.25 and as further set forth by the Building Commissioner. Registration
under Section
1492.25 will not negate the requirement for registration under this Section
1492.26.

unit regardless of whether rent is actually charged or paid.
   (b)   Certificate Issuance, Contents, Term and Revocation.
      (1)   Application for a certificate of rental property occupancy required
by the provisions of this Building and Building and Housing Code shall be made
annually by supplying necessary information to determine compliance with
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations for the existing use or
occupancy or the intended use or occupancy on forms supplied by the Building

updating of records.
      (2)   If a dwelling unit or dwelling structure intended for rent or lease
is found in compliance with the provisions of this Building and Housing Code,
and all other laws, ordinances, rules and regulations applicable thereto, the
Building Commissioner shall issue a certificate of rental property occupancy
for such building or structure, which shall contain the following information:

and Housing Code, or if the owner, agent or person in charge of a structure
refuses to comply with any applicable provision of this Building and Housing
Code.
   (c)   Failure to Apply for Certificate; Renewals.
      (1)   The owner of a dwelling structure which subsequently is completed
and becomes available for occupancy shall apply for such certificate as soon as
practicable, but in no event shall the structure be occupied in whole or in
part until such certificate of rental property occupancy has been issued.
Failure to so apply shall be deemed to be a violation of this Building and
Housing Code and shall subject the owner of the structure to the legal action
and penalty prescribed herein.
      (2)   For each 12-month period beginning July 1, 2009, and for each year
thereafter, the owner of a dwelling structure requiring a certificate of rental
property occupancy shall apply for such certificate on or before the April 1 of
that year.
   (d)   Availability of Certificate. The owner or owner's agent of a dwelling
structure requiring a certificate of occupancy, shall have such certificate
available on the licensed premises, or otherwise readily available, for
exhibition to the Building Commissioner or other authorized Village personnel.

rental property occupancy for any residential property in the Village shall be
accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first dwelling unit in a
building plus twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each additional dwelling unit in
a double house, two-family dwelling, or multiple dwelling. Where the property
owner lives in one half of a double house, the twenty-five dollar ($25.00)
additional fee does not apply. All fees for certificates of occupancy shall be
non-refundable. All fees shall be doubled after April 1 of any year.
   (f)   Changes; New Certificate of Occupancy; Fees.
      (1)   If there is a change in the resident agent or nonresident agent as
shown by the certificate of occupancy, the owner shall notify the Building
Commissioner in writing within 30 days of such change, giving the name and
address of the new resident agent or nonresident agent. Failure to notify the
Building Commissioner within the specified time shall constitute a violation of
this Building and Housing Code.
      (2)   If there is a change in ownership of record, the certificate of
rental property occupancy issued under the provisions of this Building and
Housing Code to the former owner shall become null and void within 30 days of
the recorded date of such change of ownership, and a new certificate of rental
property occupancy must be obtained by the new owner. Application for such new
certificate of rental property occupancy shall be made not more than 30 days
after such change of ownership has occurred, on forms supplied by the Building
Commissioner. A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be paid upon application
for each new certificate.

occupancy issued under the provisions of this Building and Housing Code shall
become null and void within 30 days of date of such change in tenants, and a
new certificate of rental property occupancy must be obtained by the owner.
Application for such new certificate of rental property occupancy shall be made
not more than 30 days after such change of tenants has occurred on a form
supplied by the Building Commissioner. A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be
paid upon application for each new certificate. For purposes of this chapter, a
“tenant” is a person legally obligated to the property owner or agent for use
of the dwelling unit under a written or verbal lease or rental agreement.
      (4)   Any change in the nature or extent of the use or occupancy as
specified on the certificate of rental property occupancy shall render the
certificate of rental property occupancy null and void upon the happening of
such change. No such change is permissible under this Building and Housing Code
unless such change has been approved by the proper Village authorities pursuant
to this Building and Housing Code, and unless a new certificate of occupancy,
incorporating such change, has been issued. A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00)
shall be paid upon application for each such new certificate. If such change
involves the addition of any dwelling units to the number of dwelling units
previously authorized, an additional fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be charged
for each such additional dwelling unit, regardless of the date authorized.
