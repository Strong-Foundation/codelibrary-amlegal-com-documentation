provision prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

the Adopting Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

as provided in subsection (d) hereof:

number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

109.01 INTRODUCTION.
   It is the policy of the Village of North Kingsville that openness leads to a
better informed citizenry, which leads to better government and better public
policy. It is the policy of the Village of North Kingsville to strictly adhere
to the State’s Public Records Act. All exemptions to openness are to be
construed in their narrowest sense and any denial of public records in response
to a valid request must be accompanied by an explanation, including legal
authority, as outlined in the Ohio Revised Code. If the request is in writing,
the explanation must also be in writing.
(Ord. O-07-066. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.02 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   This Village, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
records as including the following: Any document--paper, electronic (including,
but not limited to, e-mail), or other format--that is created or received by,
or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of the office. All records of the Village of North Kingsville are
public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio
Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the Village of North Kingsville that, as required
by Ohio law, records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily
available for inspection and copying (see Section
109.05 for the e-mail record policy). Record retention schedules are to be
updated regularly and posted prominently.
(Ord. O-07-066. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.03 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office’s general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested, or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see
subsection (d)(1) hereof) or be acknowledged in writing by the Village of North
Kingsville within three business days following the office’s receipt of the
request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine”, such as seeking
a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure
   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
      (Ord. O-07-066. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.04 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of making
copies.
   (a)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page over ten
(10) pages.
   (b)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
   (c)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (d)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (Ord. O-07-066. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.05 E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules. Therefore, it will be mandatory that a
hard copy of e-mails sent or received will be printed out on a weekly basis and
maintained in a file for such hard copies by each department head.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section
109.02 , Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts
and/or to the office’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in an appropriate way, retaining them
per established schedules and making them available for inspection and copying
in accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (Ord. O-07-066. Passed 12-3-07.)
109.06 FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The Village of North Kingsville recognizes the legal and non-legal
consequences of failure to properly respond to a public records request. In
addition to the distrust in government that failure to comply may cause, the
Village of North Kingsville’s failure to comply with a request may result in a
court ordering the Village of North Kingsville to comply with the law and to
pay the requester attorney’s fees and damages.

Fund, the Enterprise Fund and Special Assessment Funds of the Village of North

circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for
speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their
capital as well as the probable income to be derived.
   The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the

overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written
procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be
relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or

timely fashion and appropriated action is taken to control adverse
developments.

are to insure that the investment of funds is accomplished in a safe and secure
manner by investing these funds in accordance with all State of Ohio and

cash flow needs and receiving the best rate of return.
   (f)    Delegation of Authority. The Village of North Kingsville, as a
statutory municipality, derives its investment objectives from Ohio R.C.
Chapter 135 and related sections of Ohio R.C. Chapter 733.

eligible security dealers must be transacted on a delivery versus payment
basis. Securities will be held by a third party custodian designated by the

institution does not require a delivery versus payment basis transaction.

Kingsville's investment portfolio shall be to obtain a rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles commensurate with the portfolio's

matching the portfolio's weighted average maturity, as reported in the monthly
Federal Reserve Bulletin (Sch.H15).

145.01 PREFACE, AMENDMENT OF RULES, AND OBJECTIVES.
145.01.1 HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT.
   This document for employees of the Village of North Kingsville serves two
purposes:
   (a)   *A summary of personnel policies and practices, benefits,
responsibilities and opportunities available to you as an employee;
   (b)   *An official document governing the personnel administration of all
employees of the Village with references to the Ohio Revised Code and other
administrative orders and resolutions.
   All employees will be provided a copy of the document. It is required that
all employees take time to go over this document and make sure they are aware
of its contents and how it applies. Employees may then wish to keep this
document at work where they can refer to it as the need may arise. From time to
time this document will be updated. It is recommended that any changes received
be immediately included in the employee's copy of the document to avoid any
misunderstandings.
   If an employee has a question or a problem regarding a specific policy,
benefit, or practice, the discussion of it can be found by referring to the
Table of Contents in the front of this document or by looking up the content
area in the index at the end. These statements are written in a manner designed
to apply generally to all full-time, part-time and/or seasonal employees. In
some cases, an employee may want details or information, which was not included
in this document for the sake of brevity. A complete set of all source
documents can be made available to all employees at any time. Additional
references to specific job responsibilities and operating procedures may be
contained in the separate "Standard Operating Procedures" document designed for
various departments.
   If there is a question regarding a written policy, it should be directed to
the department head. If there should be, at any time, any conflict between the
summary in this document and the source material, the reference or source
material, which is current at the time, is the official statement.

seasonal or salaried. The pay period starts every other Sunday and runs for
(14) calendar days.

to receive his or her check. It will not be released to anyone else, unless
prior arrangements have been made.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.03.2 NEW EMPLOYEES.
   Generally, a new employee shall be paid the minimum rate of pay for his or
her class. The minimum rate for each class is based upon the assumption that a
new employee meets the minimum qualifications stated in the class/job
description. If a new employee more than meets the minimum qualifications for a
position, he or she may be appointed at the second step or in unusual cases at
a still higher step. Cases will be thoroughly analyzed and measured against
objective standards.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.03.3 PROMOTIONS.
   When an employee is promoted to a new position, that employee's salary shall
be increased to the minimum rate for the higher class. Except in the case of

minimum, be increased to the dollar step immediately above his or her present
salary.

145.03.5 TRANSFERS.
   After successful completion of the probationary period, any employee may be
transferred to the same or similar position within the department or in a
different department without being subject to a probationary period. An
employee desiring to be transferred should make the request in a letter to the
appointing authority. The heads of both divisions and departments involved must
approve a transfer.

(Ord. O-18-001. Passed 2-5-18.)
145.03.10 GARNISHMENT/CHILD SUPPORT.
   A claim may be made against an employee's salary for unpaid debts. This
claim is called a garnishment and is a court order, which requires the Village
Clerk to make a deduction from the employee's paycheck to pay a debt. A claim
may also include court ordered child support payments.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.03.11 CASH ADVANCE POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Village that no advance in an employee's pay be
made, regardless of need. This policy is necessary for the protection of public
funds with which the Village is entrusted.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
 
145.03.12 LONGEVITY.

civilian duty in connection with national defense, and for the purposes of
voting when the polls open at least two hours before or after the employee's
scheduled hours of work. An employee must notify his or her supervisor five
days prior to jury duty or service date. Any compensation received while on

difference. If the employee is on vacation or personal leave, he or she is
allowed to keep the pay.

or as defendant in a suit not resulting from his duties with the Village, he or

(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.6 INJURY LEAVE.

an injury whether caused by external accidental means or accidental in

employment with the Village. The determination of eligibility for commencement
and termination of injury leave status shall be made by the appointing
authority subject to review by the Council upon written request by the employee
within 10 days of any such determination. The employee shall be required as a
condition of eligibility for injury leave status to furnish the Council
information as required by them necessary to make a determination.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.7 FUNERAL AND BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   Regular employees are permitted to use up to three days of bereavement leave

mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in law, sister-in-law, grandparent,
grandchild or other person designated by the Council.
   Leave of absence without pay is allowed for other funerals when approved by
the employee's supervisor.
   Employee's seeking to use sick leave or funeral leave are required to call
their supervisor at least 2 hours prior to their regular starting time. Failure
to do so will result in the employee being counted as missing, thus no sick
leave benefit will be paid and the employee is subject to further disciplinary
action. Persons working shift work should give at least two hours notice so
that a replacement can be found.
   In order for leave to be paid, the employee may be required to provide
documentation to the Mayor. This information may consist of either a letter
from the funeral home or a newspaper obituary.
145.07.8 SICK LEAVE.
   Sick leave is time for which a full-time employee is compensated at his or
her regular rate when absent due to illness or another medically related
reason, such as a doctor's appointment. Example: An employee earns sick leave
time at the rate of ten (10) hours per month of service. Example: Sick leave
can be accumulated up to a maximum of 160 days for conversion upon retirement.
Upon retirement twenty-five percent of accumulated sick leave time shall be
paid to all full-time Village employees. There is no maximum for accumulation
for use. The smallest increment of sick leave, which may be used, is one hour.
   Nothing in this section shall be construed as to require the Mayor to
approve the use of sick leave by an employee when the Mayor is reasonably
certain that the employee was not ill or was not absent for the other reasons
permitted by this section. Examples of when the Mayor may not approve sick
leave are: concerted use of sick leave by an employee singly or in concert with
others as a means of withholding services; a chronic abuse of sick leave in an
established pattern; or other situations where past history and facts do not
substantiate the legitimate use of sick leave. The appointing authority may
investigate all usage of sick leave and may withhold full payment of said sick
leave until the investigation is completed.
   Should the Mayor determine that an employee has not used sick leave
properly, payment may be denied and discipline imposed. Employees who do not
report for work due to sickness, and who have exhausted their sick leave days,
are subject to disciplinary action for being absent without approved leave. The
Mayor is authorized to approve leave without pay to employees in this situation
where it is determined that such action is in the best interest of the Village.
   New employees are eligible for sick leave after successful completion of the
probationary period of six months of employment. Seasonal employees earn no
sick leave benefits. Sick leave does not accumulate while an employee is on
suspension or any unpaid leave of absence in excess of one month. (Ord. O-03-
018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.8.1 REASONS.
   Sick leave may be used for absence due to temporary disability caused by
illness, injury, pregnancy or for exposure to contagious or communicable
disease which may be transmitted to fellow employees. Any such absence shall
begin when the temporary disability or exposure shall be so severe as to
prohibit an employee from attendance at work and shall cease when an employee
is able to return to work. Sick leave may also be used for a family emergency
resulting from illness or injury to an employee's spouse, children or other
dependents residing in the employee's household. The emergency must require the
employee's presence at home or at the health care provider.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.8.2 DOCUMENTATION.
   An employee absent on sick leave for more than three (3) days shall submit a
claim for sick leave. For a sick leave absence of three days or less, Mayor may
require employees to furnish a claim for sick leave form. Failure to submit the
sick leave claim form when required will result in the employee being
determined to be on leave without pay and a deduction in the subsequent payroll
period. The claim form should be forwarded with the employee's time sheet.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.8.3 NOTICE.
   Employees seeking to use sick leave should call a supervisor two hours prior
to their regular starting time. Failure to do so may result in the employee
being counted as missing - no sick leave benefit will be paid and the employee
will be subject to disciplinary action. Employees on shift work should give at
least two hours notice so that a replacement can be found.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.8.4 CASHING OF SICK LEAVE.
   An employee who retires and meets the age and length of service requirements
of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or the Police and Fire Pension
Fund (PFPF), whichever is applicable, may redeem twenty-five percent of 160
days.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.07.8.5 TRANSFER OF SICK LEAVE.
   Any employee may file a written request with the fiscal officer of the
Village to have a portion of their accumulated sick leave transferred to
another Village employee that has eliminated or is about to eliminate all of
their personal sick leave. No transferred sick leave may be accumulated by the
receiving employee toward retirement benefits.

   (d)    On any approved leave of absence in excess of one month, the employee

duration of the leave. This cost is to be paid in advance of the first month of
the leave and prior to each month thereafter or the coverage will be
terminated.
   (e)    Failure to return from a leave of absence at the specified date will
be considered as a resignation.
   (f)    All approved leaves of absence shall be confirmed in writing to the
employee by the Mayor with a copy to the employee's file.
   (g)    Vacation and sick leave do not accrue on a leave of absence in excess
of one month. Vacation allowance is paid at the time of departure on the amount
unused and accrued. Any sick days accumulated prior to the leave may be
reinstated immediately upon return.
   (h)    Re-employment, if applicable, should be part, or the condition of,
the leave of absence. If not, the employee is subject to the availability of
employment at the time of his or her requested return. Employees returning from
military service are subject to the Veterans Re-employment Rights Act.
   (i)    There are several types of leaves of absence. They include:

the Mayor in writing. When an employee is injured on the job, a written
explanation or "injury investigation report" should be prepared by the employee

scheduled.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.2 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
145.14.2.1 OHIO ETHICS LAW.
   The Ohio Ethics Law applies to all Village officers and employees. The
Village will provide a copy of the Ohio Ethics Law to all officers and
employees within 15 days after they begin service to the Village. No Village
officer or employee may take any action to purchase or acquire services or
property for the Village where they, their family, or their business associates
have a financial interest in the service or property. No Village officer or
employee may take any action to employ his or her spouse, parents,
grandparents, children, grandchildren, brothers, or sisters and any relatives
who live with the officers or employees. No Village officers or employees may
take any official action on matters that will result in a benefit to
themselves, their family members, or their business associates. For additional
information and assistance with the Ohio Ethics Law, Village officers and
employees should contact the Ohio Ethics Commission at (614) 466-7090.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.2.2 CHARACTER AND WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR.
   (a)    Each employee shall be held accountable for his or her personal
appearance; friendly, courteous, and helpful attitude toward the public;
loyalty to the Village; and willingness to cooperate with their superiors and
fellow employees. Improper language is in extremely poor taste and displays an
unsatisfactory attitude.
 
   (b)   Each employee should be especially careful that he or she does not
engage in gossip, half-truths, or the release of confidential information
pertaining to the Village or its operations, employees, customers and
residents. The close association of the business and home lives of people in
the community makes it necessary that employees use the utmost consideration
and good judgment when speaking to others about their work and daily contacts.
145.14.2.3 BONDS
   The following Village officers and employees are required to post bonds paid
by the Village, prior to assuming the duties of their respective positions:
                             Amount of Bond:   
(a) Mayor                    $50,000.00
(b) President Pro Temp       $50,000.00
(c) Fiscal Officer           $50,000.00
(d) Income Tax Administrator $50,000.00
(e) Clerk of Mayor's Court   $50,000.00
(f) Golf Course Manager      $50,000.00
(g) Campground Manager       $50,000.00
   The Council may increase the bond amount to match the amount of cash handled
during one year if it is determined that the officer or employee is handling
more cash than the approved amounts.
(Ord. O-23-034. Passed 6-21-23.)
145.14.2.4 POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS TESTS; MEMBERSHIPS IN ORGANIZATIONS.
   Consideration of political or religious opinions as a test for employment or
promotion in any position of the Village service shall be prohibited. Village
employees will not be required to be members of any organization, unless it is
a professional organization and directly connected with employment duties. The
Village may pay membership fees required by professional organizations and/or
licenses.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.3 ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS AND GRATUITIES.
   An employee may not accept gifts, gratuities, or loans from organizations,
business concerns, or individuals with whom he/she has official relationships
of business with the Village. These limitations are not intended to prohibit
employees from accepting articles of negligible value, which are widely
distributed to the general public nor from accepting social courtesies, which
promote good public relations.
   It is particularly important that Village employees guard against
relationships, which might be construed as evidence of favoritism, coercion,
unfair advantage, or collusion. The securing of a loan by an employee from a
financial institution doing business with the Village does not constitute a
conflict of interest.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.4 DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: By Ordinance O-04-069 Council adopted a “Drug-Free Work
Program Policy” for all employees of the Village.)
   The Village of North Kingsville prohibits the manufacturing, distribution,
possession and use of alcohol, drugs, controlled substances, drug paraphernalia
or any combination thereof, on any Village premises or work site; including the
Village of North Kingsville vehicles or private vehicles parked on the Village
of North Kingsville's property or work sites. Work site is defined to mean the
site for the performance of work done in connection with employment by the
Village of North Kingsville.
   Employees taking prescribed or over-the-counter medications that may alter
their work behavior or ability to perform their duties must report the use of
these substances to their supervisors. Any employee taking prescribed
medication that leaves him or her unable to perform their job responsibilities
satisfactorily should request a leave of absence.
   The Village of North Kingsville views a violation of this policy as a
serious offense that will be investigated. The employee is expected to
cooperate with that investigation. Violating this policy or refusing to
cooperate in an investigation may result in discipline up to and including
termination.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5 SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
145.14.5.1. PURPOSE.
   (a)   To state the Village of North Kingsville's policy prohibiting
discrimination and prohibiting sexual harassment;
   
   (b)    To specifically address sexual harassment, by defining what it is, by
assisting employees in identifying sexual harassment, by listing types of
sexual harassment and some concrete examples, by describing who can be involved
in sexual harassment, and by providing employees a procedure by which they can
complain of sexual harassment and have their complaints investigated and
resolved; and,
 
   (c)    To encourage any employee who believes that he or she is a victim of
sexual harassment to come forward and voice the complaint to their superiors,
so that the Village can act to end any sexual harassment.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.2. DISCRIMINATION POLICY.
   It is the policy of the Village and all departments thereof, to provide
equal employment opportunity and equal treatment to all employees in all
aspects of employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including
pregnancy), age (40 or over), national origin, or physical or mental disability
(of an otherwise qualified individual.).
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.3 POLICY REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   It is the policy of the Village and all departments thereof, to prevent
sexual harassment and to guard against any occurrence which remotely resembles
this illegal act. Sexual harassment lowers morale and is damaging to the work
environment.
   Therefore, the Village will treat sexual harassment like any other form of
employee misconduct--it will not be tolerated.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.4 SEXUAL HARASSMENT DEFINED.
   "Sexual Harassment" is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for
sexual favors, and other verbal, visual, written or physical conduct of a
sexual nature when:
   (a)    Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment; or
   (b)    Submission to or rejection of such conduct by any individual is used
as the basis for employment decisions affecting an individual; or
   (c)    The purpose or effect of such conduct is to substantially interfere
with the individual's work performance or to create a hostile or abusive work
environment.
      (Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.5 IDENTIFICATION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   Sexual harassment may occur in a variety of forms. Four categories of sexual
harassment and some concrete examples of conduct, which may constitute sexual
harassment, if unwelcome, are:
   (a)    Verbal - unwelcome words of a sexual nature directed at another,
including: making sexual demands or sexual propositions; sexual innuendos;
demeaning sexual jokes; references to a person's anatomy; catcalls; whistles;
demeaning name-calling; remarks on the intimate details of one's life or sexual
likes or preferences; and, if unwelcome, invitations for lunch, dinner, drinks,
or dates.
   (b)    Visual - unwelcome exposure to visual objects such as: pictures,
photos, drawings, cartoons, magazines, objects, or posters (including poster
calendars); sexually obscene gestures or obvious staring and nudity.
   (c)    Written - notes or letters of sexual content, or propositions;
sexually explicit literature, poems, or magazine articles; and obscene words,
phrases or graphics on walls, bulletin boards, or posters.
   (d)    Physical - unwelcome physical contact with another, including:
touching, hugging, kissing, patting, fondling, grabbing, rubbing, pinching, and
in some instances close physical positioning.
   This list does not include all the possible behavior which could be viewed
as sexually harassing by the Village and which could result in job discipline.
It is merely a list of offensive behavior. Other behavior might be viewed as
being sexually harassing depending on the circumstances and frequency in which
they occur. Plus, some of the behavior on the list might not in all
circumstances be sexually harassing, such as when it is not unwelcome.
   Employees are reminded, however, that certain behavior may be inappropriate
for other reasons, even if the behavior is not sexually harassing. For example,
intimate behavior at work, such as kissing and handholding with a willing
partner, is always unprofessional. The Village wishes its employees to err on
the safe side.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.6 WHO CAN BE INVOLVED IN - SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   Sexual harassment can occur in a wide variety of circumstances and may
encompass many variables. It is important to realize that:
   (a)   Victims can be of either gender (male or female);
   (b)   Harassers can be of either gender (male or female);
   (c)   Harassers may be supervisors of victims, but harassers may also be co-
workers or even nonemployees;
   (d)   Harassers and victims need not be of the opposite gender, if the
conduct is still based upon sex;
   (e)   Victims may be third-party observers, affected by the behavior of
others and exposed to a hostile or abusive atmosphere based upon sex;
   (f)   Victims need not suffer any financial loss.
   The sexual harassment need not seriously affect a victim's psychological
well-being or lead the victim to suffer injury; instead, conduct or an
environment based upon sex that a reasonable person would and does believe to
be hostile or abusive constitutes sexual harassment.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.5.7 IF YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT, REGISTER A COMPLAINT WITH
YOUR SUPERVISOR.
     Any employee of the Village who feels he or she has been subjected to
sexual harassment should register a complaint with his or her supervisor.
   If all supervisors over the employee are believed to be involved in the
sexual harassment, the employee should register the complaint with the Mayor.
Likewise, if an employee believes that the Mayor is involved in the sexual
harassment, the complaint should be made to the Village Solicitor. The sexual
harassment complaint may initially be made verbally, by talking to the
appropriate supervisor. The complaint will then have to be put in writing and
signed and dated by the person complaining. An employee may write his or her
own complaint or, if the employee wishes, the supervisor will assist the
employee in drafting a complaint of sexual harassment. To the extent
practicable, a complaint of sexual harassment will be kept confidential, with
due regard to the sensitive nature of such complaints.

a report finding that sexual harassment in fact occurred, the Village shall
take immediate steps to discipline the offending employee or employees,
including, if appropriate, immediate discharge. Any Village employee who acts
in a manner to sexually harass any other Village employee is acting outside the

reasonably be perceived as a weapon (police officers and other authorized
personnel are exception.)
   (f)    Any other conduct that a reasonable person would perceive as
constituting a threat of violence.
   Any such behavior, comments, and/or weapons possession shall be reported
immediately to one’s supervisor or department head. Supervisors shall be
required to take appropriate, immediate action to curtail any such behavior or
comments. Any known weapon possession or potentially serious violent situations
shall be reported immediately by the supervisor to the Police Department.
   Violations of this policy will lead to immediate disciplinary action up to,
and including, termination and any appropriate legal action.

145.14.17 OMNIBUS TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYEE TESTING ACT OF 1991 PROGRAM
DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this section,
“alcohol” means the intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or
other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl and isopropyl alcohol.
   “Alcohol concentration” means the alcohol in a volume of breath expressed in
terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as indicated by an
evidential breath test.
   “Alcohol use” means the consumption of any beverage, mixture, or
preparation, including any medication containing alcohol.
   “Positive rate” means the number of positive results for random controlled
substances tests conducted plus the number of refusals of random controlled
substances tests required, divided by the total of random controlled substance
tests conducted plus the number of refusals of random tests required by this
part.
   “Refusal to submit” (to an alcohol or controlled substances test) means that
a driver or safety-sensitive employee (1) fails to provide adequate breath for
alcohol testing without a valid medical explanation, after he/she has received
notice of the requirement for breath testing in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter, or (2) fails to provided an adequate urine sample for
controlled substances testing as required by this chapter, without a genuine
inability to provide a specimen (as determined by a medical evaluation), after
he or she has received notice of the requirement for urine testing in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or (3) engages in conduct that
clearly obstructs the testing process.
   “Safety-sensitive function” means any of those on-duty functions set forth
in 395.2 on duty time, paragraphs (1) through (6) of OTETA §382.
   “Substance abuse profession (SAP)” means a licensed physician (of medicines
or osteopathy), a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee
assistance professional, or addiction counselor (certified by the National
Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission)
with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of
alcohol disorders.
   Effective January 1, 1995, all employees who are required to have a CDL and
the Mechanics who service the vehicles will be covered by the terms and
conditions of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Test Act of 1991. The Village
will provide drivers with training and education regarding alcohol and
substance abuse, as well as information regarding post-accident testing
procedure.
   Use of controlled substances, which cause intoxication or impairment on the
job, poses risks to the employer, the affected employee and to co-workers.
Recognizing that drug and alcohol abuse are treatable illnesses which should be
dealt with initially by treatment and education, it is the employer's policy to
prevent and rehabilitate rather than to terminate the employment of drivers who
are alcohol or drug dependent. No driver will be discharged without first
having an opportunity to seek treatment, if treatment is needed.
   The policy will be implemented in a consistent, non-discriminatory manner.
All drivers will be provided a copy of the employer's drug testing policy prior
to its implementation. In addition, drivers will be provided information
concerning the impact the use of drugs has on job performance. Drivers and
supervisors will be trained to recognize the symptoms of drug abuse, impairment
and intoxication. All drivers will be informed of the causes for testing, how
well the tests perform and what tests will be conducted.
   All newly employed drivers will receive the information no later than their
initial hire date. No driver shall be tested until this information in provided
to the employee.
   Random Testing
   As required by the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991
(OTETA), the Village will conduct random drug and alcohol testing. The Village
will submit all drivers to a random selection system. Random drug testing will
not be performed except where required by OTETA.
   Post-Accident Testing
   When a driver is involved in an accident where a fatality is involved, the
driver shall submit to post-accident drug and alcohol testing. Where a driver
is involved in a recordable accident and receives a citation for a moving
violation arising from the accident, the driver must submit to drug and alcohol
test.
   In the event a driver is so seriously injured that the driver cannot provide
a specimen at the time of the accident, the driver must provide necessary
authorization for the Village to obtain medical records, or other documents
that would indicate whether there were controlled substances or alcohol in the
driver's system at the time of the accident. All testing shall be done in
accordance with the provisions of OTETA.
   Reasonable Cause/Suspicion Test
   Drug testing may be administered only where there is reasonable suspicion to
believe that the driver is demonstrating the symptoms of intoxication,
impairment or drug abuse through use of a controlled substance while on duty.
   The term “reasonable suspicion” shall for the purposes of this policy be
defined as follows:
   Aberrant or unusual on-duty behavior of an individual which:
   (a)   Is observed on duty by the driver's supervisor who is trained to
recognize the symptoms of intoxication, impairment or drug abuse;
   (b)    Is the type of behavior, which is recognized and accepted as symptoms
of intoxication or impairment caused by controlled substances or alcohol.
   Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific personal observation by
supervisors which must be documented in writing within 24 hours of the
observation or prior to the release of the test results, whichever is later
(OTETA §382.307)
   Violations of the procedures outlined under OTETA will render the test
results invalid. The test results will be destroyed and no discipline will be
administered to the affected employee.
   Drivers will be given an opportunity to give an explanation of their
condition to the Village.
   Refusal to submit to toxicology testing after being properly ordered to do
so may result in disciplinary action. Said driver, after refusing to be tested,
will be deemed to be on leave without pay pending disciplinary action.
   Those drivers tested will be deemed to be on leave with pay for any portion
of the workday necessary to perform the testing. Should the employee's test
results be positive, the employee will not be paid for those hours of work
following completion of the testing.
   Testing Procedures
   The following test procedure shall apply to urine tests administered to
drivers:
   The driver shall not be observed when the urine specimen is given unless
required by OTETA.
   At the time the urine specimen is collected, two samples will be taken; the
primary and split specimen. Both samples will be sent to the laboratory to be
tested at the employer's expense, with the primary specimen being tested
initially with the split specimen to be tested only upon the request of the
employee within 72 hours of his/her notification of a positive test result of
the primary sample. All test results are to be reviewed by a medical review
officer before being released. Test results must be completed by the employer
within 48 hours of the testing.
   The testing shall be done by a certified laboratory as required by OTETA.
   If the results of the tests administered by the employer on the two samples
show that the driver while on duty demonstrated the symptoms of intoxication,
impairment or drug abuse through use of a controlled substance, the driver
shall be given a copy of the laboratory report of both specimens before
discipline is imposed.
   Testing Procedures: Alcohol
   The following test procedure shall apply to alcohol testing:
   This section is applicable for random, post-accident, return-to-duty,
follow-up, reasonable suspicion, and pre-transfer testing using procedures
specified in the federal regulations. These procedures use an Evidential Breath
Testing device (EBT), approved by the Nation Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) rules prohibit the performance of
safety- sensitive functions in the following circumstances:
    (a)    While having prohibited concentrations of alcohol in the system.
   (b)    While using alcohol.
   (c)    Within four hours after using alcohol.
   (d)    Using alcohol within eight hours after an accident or until tested,
whichever occurs first.
    (e)    While having possession of alcohol.
   A screening test is conducted first, with any result of less than 0.02
alcohol concentration being considered a "negative test." If the alcohol
concentration is 0.02 or greater, a second or confirmation test must be
conducted.
   Following a determination that an employee has violated the alcohol
prohibitions by having a test result of 0.04 Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) or
greater, the employee must be removed from the safety-related functions and
meet the following minimum requirements before being returned to duty:
   (a)    The employee undergoes evaluation, and where necessary,
rehabilitation;
   (b)    A Substance Abuse Professional (SA) determines that the employee has
successfully complied with any required rehabilitation, and
   (c)    The employee undergoes a return-to-duty test with a result of less
than 0.02. An employee with an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but
less than 0.04 is not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions for a
minimum of 24 hours and therefore will be released from duty without pay and
may not be recalled to duty during this period.
 
   Random Testing
   A safety-sensitive employee may only be tested while the safety-sensitive
employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the safety-
sensitive employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the
safety-sensitive employee has ceased performing such functions. After
notification, the safety-sensitive employee selected for random testing shall
proceed to the testing site immediately.
   Post-Accident Testing
   As soon as practicable following an accident, each safety-sensitive employee
shall test for alcohol:
   (a)    Who was performing safety-sensitive functions with respect to the
vehicle, if the accident involved the loss of human life; or
   (b)    Who receives a citation under state or local law for a moving traffic
violation arising from the accident.
   A safety-sensitive employee who is subject to post-accident testing shall
remain readily available for such testing or he/she may be deemed by the
Village to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for injured
persons following an accident or to prohibit a safety-sensitive employee from
leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance
in responding to the accident, or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
   The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol, conducted by
federal, state, or local officials having independent authority for the test,
shall be considered to meet the requirements of this section, provided such
tests conform to applicable federal, state, or local requirements, and that the
results of the tests are obtained by the Village.
   Return-to-Duty Testing
   Before a safety-sensitive employee returns to duty requiring the performance
of a safety- sensitive function after engaging in prohibited conduct, the
safety-sensitive employee shall undergo an alcohol test with a result
indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
   Follow-up Testing
   Following a determination that a safety-sensitive employee is in need of
assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, the Village
shall ensure that the safety- sensitive employee is subject to unannounced
follow-up alcohol testing as directed by a SAP, following the safety-sensitive
employee's return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing
shall be as directed by the SAP, and consist of at least six tests in the first
twelve months following the safety-sensitive employee's return to duty. Any
such testing shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of 49 CFR
Part 40, and shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the safety-sensitive
employee's return to duty. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up
testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if the
SAP determines that such testing is no longer necessary. During the 60-month
period the employee remains separately subject to random testing as well.
   Reasonable Suspicion Testing
   The Village shall require a safety-sensitive employee to submit to an
alcohol test when a supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe that the
safety-sensitive employee has violated the prohibitions of Section G-3. The
Village's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the safety-
sensitive employee to undergo an alcohol test must be based on specific,
contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior,
speech or body odors of the safety-sensitive employee.
   The required observations for alcohol reasonable-suspicion testing shall be
made by a supervisor or Village official who is trained in accordance with the
federal regulations.
   Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the observations
required are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work
day that the safety-sensitive employee is required to be in compliance with
this part. A safety-sensitive employee may be directed by the Village to only
undergo reasonable-suspicion testing while the safety-sensitive employee is to
perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the safety-sensitive employee
has ceased performing such functions.
   Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable-suspicion alcohol test under
this section, no safety-sensitive employee shall report for duty or remain on
duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while the safety-
sensitive employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown
by the behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor
shall the Village permit the safety-sensitive employee to perform or continue
to perform the safety- sensitive functions, until: 
   (a)    An alcohol test is administered and the safety-sensitive employee's
alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or
   (b)    Twenty-four hours have elapsed following the determination that there
is reasonable suspicion to believe that the safety-sensitive employee has
violated the prohibitions concerning the use of alcohol.
   Pre-Transfer Testing
   Prior to the first time a covered employee performs safety-sensitive
functions, the Village shall ensure that the employee undergoes testing for
alcohol, which indicates an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. If the
employee is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, but less
than 0.04, the employee shall not be permitted to perform safety-sensitive
functions until:
   (a)    The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or
   (b)    The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but
not less than eight hours following administration of the test.
   Drivers who seek voluntary assistance for alcohol or drug abuse may not be
disciplined for seeking such assistance. All requests from employees for
assistance shall remain confidential. Drivers at their option shall be entitled
to take accrued sick leave, vacation leave, or leave without pay during
absences required as part of the rehabilitation process.
   Any provision mandated under OTETA and not covered by the provisions of this
chapter shall be governed by the federal act.
   Any dispute, which may arise over compliance with this policy, shall be
resolved through the grievance procedure of this manual.
(Ord. O-03-018. Passed 5-21-03.)
145.14.18 SAMPLE E-MAIL POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. Electronic mail, Internet and telecommunication access are
resources made available to Village employees to communicate with each other,
other governmental entities, companies and individuals for the benefit of the
City.
   (b)   Policy. The Village of North Kingsville Electronic Mail System (e-
mail) is designed to facilitate Village business communication among employees
and other business associates for messages or memoranda. Since no computer
system is completely secure, the e-mail system is not intended to transmit
sensitive materials, such as personnel decisions and other similar information
which may be more appropriately communicated by written memorandum or personal
conversation.
   The e-mail system is Village property and intended for Village business. The
system is not to be used for employee personal gain or to support or advocate
for non city-related business or purposes. All data and other electronic
messages within this system are the property of the Village of North
Kingsville. E-mail messages have been found to be public records and may be
subject to the right-to-know laws, depending on their content.
   In addition, the City, through its managers and supervisors, reserves the
right to review the contents of employee's e-mail communications when necessary
for village business purposes. Employees may not intentionally intercept,
eavesdrop, record, read, alter, or receive other persons' e-mail messages,
without proper authorization.
   The Village of North Kingsville, through its MIS division, purchases, owns
and administers the necessary software and licenses to provide access to e-mail
and Internet services. Employees may not rent, copy or loan the software, or
its documentation. The Village has invested much time and money to secure its
electronic systems from intrusion and harmful viruses. Therefore, employees may
not provide alternative software to access the system. Employees may be held
responsible for any damages caused by using unauthorized software or viruses
they introduce into the Village system. Department heads are responsible for
the implementation and adherence of this policy within their departments.
   (c)   Procedures.
      (1)   General Information on Passwords. While you may have a confidential
password, users should be aware that this does not mean that the system is for
personal confidential communication, nor does, it suggest that e-mail is the
property right of the employee. The use of the e-mail system is for Village
business. Passwords should be periodically changed to ensure security of the e-
mail system. Users should not share their passwords with anyone else, other
than as his or her managers may require.
      (2)   Internet. The Internet provides the Village with significant access
and dissemination of information to individuals outside of the Village. The use
of the Internet system for access and dissemination is intended to serve
village business. Like all e-mail messages, Internet messages are capable of
being forwarded without the express permission of the original author. E-mail
messages are also routinely passed through routers before they reach their
final destination. A message is touched many times before it gets to its
recipient, and the message author should be aware of this.
         Therefore, users must use caution in the transmission and
dissemination of messages outside of the Village, and must comply with all
State and federal laws.
      (3)   Prohibited Uses. When sending e-mail messages, appropriateness and
good judgment should be used. The following are examples of e-mail uses that
are prohibited:
         A.   Communications that in any way may be construed by others as
disruptive, offensive, abusive, or threatening;
         B.   Communications of sexually explicit images or messages;
         C.   Communications that contain ethnic slurs, racial epithets, or
anything that may be construed as harassment or disparagement of others based
on race, national origin, sex, age, disability or religious beliefs;
         D.   Solicitation for commercial ventures, religious or political
causes, outside organizations, or other nonjob-related solicitations; and
         E.   Any other use that may compromise the integrity of the Village
and its business in any way.
      (4)   Retention of E-mail. Generally, e-mail messages are intended to be
temporary communications that are non-vital and may be discarded routinely.
However, depending on the content of the e-mail message, it may be considered a
more formal record and should be retained pursuant to a department's record
retention schedules. As such, these e-mail messages are similar to printed
communication and should be written with the same care. Each department head is
responsible for establishing and maintaining department retention schedules for
the information communicated through the e-mail system.
         However, employees should be aware that when they have deleted a
message from their workstation mailbox it might not have been deleted from the
central e-mail system. The message may be residing in the recipient's mailbox
or forwarded to other recipients. Furthermore, the message may be stored on the
computer's back-up system for an indefinite period. Note that e-mail has been
classified as public documents, i.e. available to the media, in at least one
state. Keep that in mind when you create or store e-mail.
         Employees should delete e-mail messages as soon as possible after
reading. An accumulation of files will degrade system performance and response
times. The MIS system will automatically delete all messages after 60 days,
unless archived by the user. Contact MIS if you are unsure as to how to archive
messages.
      (5)   Applicability to Employees, Part Time Employees, Contractors, and
Other Users. This e-mail policy applies to all employees, contractors, part-
time employees, volunteers, and other individuals who are provided access to
the Village's e-mail system. Third parties should only be provided access to
the e-mail system as necessary for their business purpose with the Village and
only if they abide by all applicable rules.
      (6)   Employee Termination, Leave of Absence, Vacation, and Other.
Employees who leave employment with the Village have no right to the contents
of their e-mail messages and are not allowed access to the e-mail system.
Supervisors or management may access an employee's e-mail if employees are on
leave of absence, vacation, or are transferred from one department to another
department and it is necessary for the city's business purposes.
      (7)   Penalties. The misuse of the Internet or e-mail privileges may be
considered sufficient cause for discipline in accordance with the Human
Resource Personnel Policies and Procedures, and/or other applicable rules or
laws. In addition, violations of this policy or misuse of the e-mail system may
be referred for criminal prosecution.
   (d)   Acceptance. The Village will require employees to read and signify
acceptance of the terms of this policy by signing the following agreement
before making electronic systems available.
      (1)   Agreement to E-mail Policy. I have read and agree to the specifics
as stated in the attached E-mail Policy, which includes the following
specifics.
         A.    That my use of the e-mail system is for the furthering of the
business of this Municipality;
         B.   That I may not intentionally intercept, eavesdrop, record, read,
alter, or receive other persons' e-mail messages without proper authorization;
         C.    That I may not use the e-mail system for solicitation of funds,
political messages, or harassing messages;
         D.    That my e-mail messages and data are the property of the Village
of North Kingsville and may be accessed for review by supervisors; and
         E.    That my e-mail will be retained according to the attached
Retention of E-mail policy.

   (a)    It is the policy of the Village of North Kingsville to assure that
applicants for employment by the Village and employees of the Village are
treated, as to their qualifications for employment, and during employment,
without regard to their race, religion, sex, age, color or national origin. The
position of the Village of North Kingsville with regard to this policy shall
include employment, upgrading, demotion, transfer, recruitment, recruitment
advertising, lay-off, termination, rates of pay, other forms of compensation,

All supervisors of employees of the Village of North Kingsville have been

145.16.8 PERS PICK-UP.
   (a)    Effective March 8, 1992, the full amount of the statutorily required
contributions to the Public Employees' Retirement System of Ohio (PERS) shall
be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof and shall be "picked up" (assumed and paid
to the PERS) by the Village. This pick-up by the Village is, and shall be
designated as, public employee contributions and shall be in lieu of
contributions to the PERS by each person within any of the classes established
in subsection (b) hereof. No person subject to this pick-up shall have the
option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to the PERS
directly instead of having it picked up by the Village or of being excluded
from the pick-up.
   The Village shall, in reporting and making remittance to the PERS, report
that the public employee contribution for each person subject to this pick-up
has been made as provided by State statute.
 
   (b)    The pick-up by the Village provided by this section shall apply to
all employees of the Village who are or become contributing members of the
PERS.
 
   (c)    The Village's method of payment of salary to employees who are
participants in the PERS is hereby modified as follows, in order to provide for
a salary reduction pick-up of employee contributions to PERS: The total salary
for each employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under Village policies.
Such total salary of each employee shall be payable by the Village in two
parts:
      (1)    Deferred salary; and
      (2)    Cash salary.
   An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of the
employee's total salary which is required from time to time by the PERS to be
paid as an employee contribution by that employee, and the same shall be paid
by the Village to the PERS on behalf of that employee as a pick-up and in lieu
of the PERS employee contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An
employee's cash salary shall be equal to that employee's total salary less the
amount of the pick-up for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to
applicable payroll deductions, to that employee. The Village shall compute and
remit its employer contributions to the PERS based upon an employee's total
salary. The total combined expenditures of the Village for such employee's
total salary, payable under applicable Village policies, and the pick-up
provisions of this section, shall not be greater than the amounts it would have
paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.
 
   (d)    The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to implement
the provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily
required contributions to the PERS for those persons provided for in subsection
(b) hereof so as to enable them to obtain the result in Federal and State tax

   (a)    Effective December 29, 1991, the full amount of the statutorily
required contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund
shall be withheld from the gross pay of each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof and shall be "picked up" (assumed and paid
to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund) by the Village. This
pick-up by the Village is, and shall be designated as, public employee
contributions and shall be in lieu of contributions to the Police and Firemen's
Disability and Pension Fund by each person within any of the classes
established in subsection (b) hereof. No person subject to this pick-up shall
have the option of choosing to receive the statutorily required contribution to
the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund directly instead of having
it picked up by the Village or of being excluded from the pick-up.
   The Village shall, in reporting and making remittance to the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund, report that the contribution for each
person subject to this pick-up has been made as provided by State statute.
 
   (b)    The pick-up by the Village provided by this section shall apply to
all employees of the Village who are or become contributing members of the

modified as follows, in order to provide for a salary reduction pick-up of

The total salary for each employee shall be the salary otherwise payable under
Village policies. Such total salary of each employee shall be payable by the
Village in two parts:
      (1)    Deferred salary; and
      (2)    Cash salary.
   An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of that
employee's total salary which is required from time to time by the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund to be paid as an employee contribution by
that employee, and the same shall be paid by the Village to the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund on behalf of that employee as a pick-up
and in lieu of the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund employee
contribution otherwise payable by that employee. An employee's cash salary
shall be equal to that employee's total salary less the amount of the pick-up
for that employee, and shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll
deductions, to that employee. The Village shall compute and remit its employer
contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund based
upon an employee's total salary. The total combined expenditures of the Village
for such employee's total salary, payable under applicable Village policies,
and the pick-up provisions of this section, shall not be greater than the
amounts it would have paid for those items had this provision not been in
effect.
   The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to implement the
provisions of this section to institute the pick-up of the statutorily required
contributions to the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund for those
persons provided in subsection (b) hereof, so as to enable them to obtain the
result in Federal and State tax deferments and other benefits.

TITLE NINE - Judiciary
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of North Kingsville
has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
North Kingsville ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes
involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within
the corporate limits of North Kingsville, subject to the limitations of Ohio
R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor
shall be governed by the laws pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Ashtabula County (the Eastern Area County Court in Jefferson,
Ohio) and the magistrate shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together
with a transcript of proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such
recognizance, if given, to the court of record. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio
Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in petty offense cases, where there
is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall be tried by the court unless he
or she demands a jury trial. The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such
cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides
that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the
defendant waives his or her right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the
case only if (1) his or her compensation as a judge is not directly dependent
upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and
administrative officer of the municipality and as such responsible for the
financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be
taken by any mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any North
Kingsville ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas," the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operator's or chauffeur's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4611.19 or Section
333.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4607.16(B).

   (b)   If a person misbehaves in such a manner as to obstruct the

court, and may be fined not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for such
contempt.
   (c)   In all contempt proceedings for misbehavior obstructing the
administration of Mayor’s Court, the Mayor or magistrate shall conduct a
hearing. At the hearing, the Mayor or magistrate shall investigate the charge
and hear any answer or testimony that the accused makes or offers and shall
determine whether the accused is guilty of the contempt charge.

income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following

   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the Village of North Kingsville shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Village of North Kingsville for purposes of income
taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village of North Kingsville during the taxable period, to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business of profession during the same period, wherever
situated. As used in this paragraph, “real property” includes property rented
or leased by the taxpayer. The value for such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village of North Kingsville, to wages, salaries and other compensation
paid during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed. Wages, salaries, and other compensation
shall be included to the extent that they represent qualifying wages.
      (3)   The gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales and services wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in this section, "sales made in the Village of North
Kingsville” means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of North Kingsville, regardless of where title passes, if shipped
or delivered from a stock of goods within the Village of North Kingsville;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of North Kingsville, regardless of where title passes, even though
transported from a point outside the Village of North Kingsville, if the
taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or
promotion of sales within the Village of North Kingsville and the sales result
from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of North Kingsville to purchasers outside the Village
of North Kingsville, regardless of where title passes, if the taxpayer is not,
through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion
of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
181.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax imposed under this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
or received on and after January 1, 1992, and with respect to the net profit of
businesses, professions and other activities earned on and after January 1,
1992, provided, however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession
or other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to
that part of the net profit for the fiscal year as is earned on and after
January 1, 1992, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the
taxpayer shall report on its fiscal year basis. Ordinance O- 04-038, passed
July 6, 2004, amends and replaces previous ordinances and amendments thereto
from the effective date of this section.
(Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
 
181.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each taxpayer, eighteen (18) years of age or older if an individual,
whose income and/or net profits are subject to the tax imposed by this chapter
shall, whether or not tax is due thereon, make and file a final return with the
Income Tax Clerk on or before April 15th of each year, on a form obtainable
from the Income Tax Clerk or a generic form, setting forth the aggregate amount
of income, salaries, wages or other compensation and net profits earned or
received by him or her during the preceding year or period. However, when the
final return is made for a fiscal year or other period different from the
calendar year, the return shall be made within one hundred five (105) days from
the end of such fiscal year or other period. The final tax return for each year
shall be accompanied by W-2's and 1099's issued to and received by the
taxpayer.
   (b)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed on such
income and profits. The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Village of North Kingsville the amount of taxes
shown as due thereon. However, where any portion of such tax has been paid by
such taxpayer pursuant to Section
181.06, Tax Withheld by Employer, and/or Section
181.07, Estimated Tax Payments, or Section
181.08, Credits, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the
amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable
at the time of filing such final return. Schedules needed to support the tax
returns are to be filed with the tax return, as well as other pertinent
statements, information returns or other information as the Income Tax Clerk
may require.
   (c)   The W-2 Form of any employer or employee showing the amount of tax
deducted by such employer from the income, salaries, wages or compensation of
any nonresident employee, and paid by him or her to the Village of North
Kingsville, shall, at the discretion of the Clerk Treasurer, be accepted as the
return required of any employee whose sole income subject to the tax of one
percent is such income, salaries, wages or compensation.
   (d)   Extension of Time for Filing Returns.
      (1)   Taxpayers granted extensions of time for filing their federal
income tax returns may have an extension for filing their North Kingsville Tax
Return provided that a copy of the federal extension is filed with the Income
Tax Clerk on or before the original due date of the North Kingsville Tax
Return. The Income Tax Clerk can refuse an extension if the taxpayer did not
file a timely request or the taxpayer’s Village of North Kingsville tax account
is delinquent in any manner (i.e., failed to file required documents or owes
delinquent taxes, or penalties, and/or interest).
      (2)   The extended date for filing the North Kingsville return will be
the same as the extended date for the federal return regardless of the original
due date of the tax return, excepting that for taxable year 2004 the extended
due date shall be the last day of the month following the month to which the
due date of the federal income tax return has been extended, and for tax years
2005 and later shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended. The granting of an extension for
the filing of a Village of North Kingsville Income Tax Return does not extend
payment; hence, interest will be charged from the original due date of the
return until date of actual payment, at the rate of one percent (1%) per month.
      (3)   If a taxpayer wishes to extend the time for filing the North
Kingsville tax return to a date beyond that provided above, the taxpayer must
file such a request in writing to the Income Tax Clerk prior to the due date of
the automatic extension.
   (e)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a return of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Section
181.15. Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Clerk. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e.,
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the annual return.
 
   (f)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's North Kingsville tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended North Kingsville return showing income
subject to the North Kingsville tax based upon such final determination of
Federal tax liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make
claim for return of any overpayment.
   (g)   The officer and/or employee of such employer having control or
supervision or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making
the payment, shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay
the tax, penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution,
bankruptcy or reorganization of any such employer does not discharge any
officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file
a return and/or pay taxes, penalties, and/or interest due.
   (h)   The Tax Return is considered received if mailed, on the date
postmarked by the United States Post Office Postal Service or on the date
delivered without mailing to the Village of North Kingsville Tax Office.
   (i)   Consolidated Returns.
      (1)   Consolidated returns may be filed by a group of corporations who
are affiliated through stock ownership provided such group files consolidated
returns for federal income tax purposes. For a subsidiary corporation to be
included in a consolidated return, eighty percent (80%) of its stock must be
owned by the other members of the affiliated group. A consolidated return must
include all companies which are so affiliated.
      (2)   Once a consolidated return has been filed for any taxable year the
consolidated group must continue to file consolidated returns in subsequent
years unless:
         A.   Permission in writing is granted by the Tax Clerk to file
separate returns.
         B.   A new corporation other than a corporation created or organized
by a member of the group has become a member of the group during the taxable
year.
         C.   A corporation member of the group is sold or exchanged.
Liquidating a corporation or merging one of the corporations of the group into
another will not qualify the group for filing separate returns.
      (3)   If a corporation becomes a member of the group during the taxable
year, the consolidated return must include the income from the entire taxable
year of the common parent corporation and any subsidiaries which were members
of the group for the entire year, plus the income of each subsidiary which
becomes a member of the group during the year for the period beginning with the
date it became a member of the affiliated group. For the period prior to the
time any subsidiary became a member of the group, separate returns must be
filed for that subsidiary. When a subsidiary ceases to be a member of the
affiliated group, the consolidated return must include the income of such
subsidiary for the period during which it was a member of the group, but
separate returns must be filed for the period after it ceases to be a member.
   If a corporation has been a member of the affiliated group for less than one
month of the taxable year of the group, it may be considered as not being part
of the group. Similarly, a subsidiary may be considered as being a member of
the affiliated group during the entire taxable year of the group if the period
during which it was not a member of the group does not exceed one month. If a
subsidiary is a member of a consolidated group for only part of a taxable year,
the income considered to be earned in such fractional part of the year shall be
that portion of the net income for the entire year which the number of days it
was a member of the group bears to the total number of days in the taxable
year.
      (4)   In determining the allocation fraction where a corporation becomes
a member of the group or ceases to be a member of the group during the taxable
year, the property factor (Step 1 of the formula) shall be determined on the
basis of the average net book value of the property during the period such
corporation was a member of the group. The rental portion of the factor,
however, shall be computed at 8 times the annual rent. The gross receipts and
wage factors shall be based on the actual figures.
      (5)   All subsidiary corporations must agree in writing to the filing of
the consolidated return, as they will be liable for the tax as well as the
parent corporation.
   (j)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (k)   Payments received for taxes due shall be allocated first to penalties
due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due.
   (l)   If it appears that such taxpayer has paid more than the amount of tax
to which the Village of North Kingsville is entitled, a refund of the amount so
overpaid shall be made or the same may be applied toward the declaration of tax
due for the ensuing year. (Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
  
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING BY EMPLOYER.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village of North
Kingsville who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission,
income, or other compensation basis shall deduct from each periodic
compensation paid, and at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission, income, or other compensation, the tax at the current rate of
Municipal Income Tax from salaries, wages, commissions, income, or other
compensation paid by the said employer to the said employee.
   (b)   Each such employer shall, on or before the last day of the month

($100.00) or more per month in the previous tax year shall, on or before the
last day of the month following the month for which taxes have been withheld,
make a return and remit the tax hereby required to be withheld to the Income
Tax Clerk. Such return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Income Tax Clerk and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor by the Income Tax Clerk. Such employer shall be liable for
the payment of taxes hereby required to be deducted and withheld, whether or
not such taxes have in fact been so deducted and withheld.
   (c)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Village of North Kingsville, as a
trustee for the benefit of the Village of North Kingsville, and any such tax
collected by such employer from its employees shall, until the same is paid to
the Village of North Kingsville, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer.
   (d)   The officer and/or the employee having control of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the return and making payment, shall be personally
liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax due as required by this
section. The dissolution, bankruptcy or reorganization of any such employer
does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of
the corporation to file returns and/or pay taxes, penalties, and/or interest
due.
   (e)   On or before January 31 following any calendar year, such employer
shall file with the Income Tax Clerk an annual reconciliation return along with
an information return for such employee from whom North Kingsville Income Tax
has been or should have been withheld, showing the name, address and Social
Security number of the employee, the total amount of compensation paid during
the year and the amount of municipal income tax withheld from the employee with
the municipality for which said tax was withheld identified. The information
return shall also include all of the information required to be reported by the
employer to IRS on a W-2 form. At the time of filing the annual reconciliation
return the employer shall pay over any amounts deducted or which should have
been deducted during the preceding year but which were not remitted. The annual
reconciliation form shall be obtained from the Income Tax Clerk.
   (f)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others who are
required under the Internal Revenue Code to furnish forms 1099 to IRS for
individuals or businesses to whom or which they have non-employee compensation
shall furnish copies of the said form 1099's to the Income Tax Clerk or in lieu
thereof, a list containing the same information as required by IRS on the
1099's on or before the due date for such forms 1099's as established by IRS.
Failure to provide the foregoing information may result in any deduction for
payment by the taxpayer taken on the taxpayer's return to be disallowed.
   (g)   Every employer shall retain all records necessary to compute
withholding taxes due North Kingsville for a period of six years from the date
the Reconciliation form, W-2 Forms, and 1099 forms are filed.
   (h)   All returns and forms required to be filed by an employer are
considered received on the date postmarked by the United States Postal Service
or on the date delivered without mailing by the taxpayer to the North
Kingsville Tax Office.
   (i)   The failure of any employer to receive or procure a return, or other
required form shall not excuse the employer from preparing any information
return, withholding tax returns or from filing such forms or from paying the
tax due.
   (j)   Payments received for withholding taxes due shall be applied first to
penalties due, then to interest due, and then to taxes due.
   (k)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village
of North Kingsville, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that
service, shall provide the Village of North Kingsville the names and addresses
of the subcontractors. The subcontractors shall be responsible for all income
tax withholding requirements under this chapter.
   (l)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages or other
compensation paid domestic employees employed exclusively in or about such
person's residence, but such employee shall be subject to all of the
requirements of the chapter, including making quarterly estimated payments.
(Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)

for each calendar year on or before April 15 of each ensuing year for the

assessment showing the amount of tax due, together with any penalty and
interest that may have accrued thereon.
      (1)   If the Income Tax Department determines that any taxpayer subject
to the provisions of the chapter has a tax liability for which the taxpayer has

showing the amount of tax due together with any penalty and interest that may
have accrued thereon.

proposed assessment was served or mailed, file a written protest with the
Income Tax Department. A final assessment shall then be issued by the Income
Tax Clerk. The taxpayer shall then have the right to appeal the final
assessment to the Board of Review in accordance with the provisions of Section

are confidential and shall be carefully preserved so that they are not
available for inspection by anyone other than the proper agents of the Village
of North Kingsville for official tax purposes.

an investigation, hearing or verification required or authorized by this

prosecutions for the punishment of violations of this chapter are fully

(Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
181.17 INTEREST AND CIVIL PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter, including taxes withheld from wages
by an employer and remaining unpaid after they have become due, shall bear
interest on the amount of the unpaid tax at the rate of one percent (1%) per
month or fraction of a month thereof and the taxpayers upon whom such taxes are
imposed, and the employers required by this chapter to deduct, withhold and pay
taxes imposed by this chapter, shall be liable, in addition thereto, to a
penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of the unpaid tax for each month or
fraction of a month thereof for the first six months of nonpayment, or fifty
dollars ($50.00), whichever is greater. Upon recommendation of the Village of
North Kingsville, the Board of Review may abate interest or penalties, or both,
and upon appeal from the refusal of the Municipality to so recommend, the Board
may nevertheless abate interest or penalties, or both.
   (b)   A penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) shall be assessed on any taxpayer
who fails to file the annual tax due as required at Section
181.05 regardless of whether or not a tax liability remains due.
   (c)   No penalty shall be assessed on additional taxes found on an audit to
be due when a return was timely filed in good faith and the tax paid thereon
within fifteen (15) days from the date the taxpayer was notified of such
finding.
   (d)   In the absence of fraud neither penalty nor interest shall be assessed
on any additional taxes resulting from a federal audit for federal income tax
purposes provided an amended return is filed and the additional tax paid within
three (3) months after final determination of the federal tax liability. (Ord.
O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
181.18 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES-REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS; CIVIL LITIGATION;
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. Such suit shall be brought within three (3) years after the tax
was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. In the case of fraud,
omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income subject to this tax, or
failure to file a return, all additional assessments shall be made and all
prosecutions to recover Municipal income taxes and penalties and interest
thereon shall be brought within six (6) years after the tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date such payment was made or the return
was due or within three months after final determination of the Federal tax
liability, whichever is later. However, the following shall apply regarding
refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon
which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates applied to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee’s
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of North
Kingsville, but should have been deposited with another municipality, is
allowable by the Village of North Kingsville as a refund but is subject to the
three-year limitation on refunds. Income tax that should have been deposited
with the Village of North Kingsville, but was deposited with another
municipality, shall be subject to recovery by the Village of North Kingsville.
The Village of North Kingsville will allow a non-refundable credit for any
amount owed the Village of North Kingsville that is in excess of the amount to
be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate of the other
municipality is the same or higher than the Village of North Kingsville tax
rate. If the Village of North Kingsville tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by
the Village of North Kingsville.
   (d)   Payments received shall first be applied to delinquent penalties and
interest, and then to taxes, beginning with the oldest year outstanding.
(Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)

part of the tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter shall be in

(Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
181.20 FAILURE TO OBTAIN FORMS.
   The failure of an employer, taxpayer or other person to receive or procure a
return, declaration or other required form shall not excuse him or her from
making any information return or declaration, from filing such form or from
paying the tax. (Ord. O-04-038. Passed 7-6-04.)
181.21 SEPARABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
an individual or any of the several groups specified in this chapter, is found
to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality,
illegality or invalidity shall affect only such sentence, clause, section or

property, including leasehold improvements owned or used in the business
wherever situated, during the period covered by the return. The percentage of
taxpayer's real and tangible personal property within the Village of North
Kingsville is determined by dividing the average original cost of such property

salaries commissions and other compensation of employees within the Village of

            (i)    Wages, salaries and other compensation may be computed on
the cash or accrual basis. Wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be
included to the extent that they represent qualifying wages.
            (ii)    In the case of an employee who performs services both
within and without the Village of North Kingsville, the amount treated as
compensation for services performed within the Village of North Kingsville
shall be deemed to be:
               (a)   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends
directly on the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a
commission basis, the amount earned or received by him for the business
attributable to his efforts within the Village of North Kingsville.
                  (b)   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends

investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,

               (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (2)(b)(iv)(a) or (b)
of this section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal
income tax liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the
employer may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
         (c)    Step 3 - Ascertain the percentage which the gross receipts of
the taxpayer derived from sales and rentals made and services performed in the
Village of North Kingsville is of the total gross receipts wherever derived
during the period covered by the return. In the application of the following
sales determination factors, a carrier shall be considered the agent of the
seller regardless of the FOB point or other conditions of the sale and the
place at which orders are accepted or contracts legally consummated shall be
immaterial. Solicitations of customers outside of the Village of North
Kingsville by mail, telephone, or otherwise electronically from an office or
place of business within the Village of North Kingsville shall not be
considered a solicitation of sales outside the Village of North Kingsville. For
the purposes of this division, receipts from sales and rentals made and
services performed shall be sitused to the Village of North Kingsville as
follows:
            (i)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in the Village of
North Kingsville if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any
of the following criteria:
               (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the
Village of North Kingsville from a stock of goods located within the Village of
North Kingsville.
               (b)    The property is delivered within the Village of North
Kingsville from a location outside the Village of North Kingsville, provided
the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation
or promotion of sales within the Village of North Kingsville and the sales
result from such solicitation or promotion.
               (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the Village
of North Kingsville to purchasers outside the Village of North Kingsville,
provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged
in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
            (ii)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused
to the Village of North Kingsville to the extent that such services are
performed in the Village of North Kingsville.
            (iii)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the
sale of real property located in the Village of North Kingsville shall be
sitused to the Village of North Kingsville.
            (iv)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in the Village of North Kingsville
shall be sitused to the Village of North Kingsville.
             (v)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible
personal property shall be sitused to the Village of North Kingsville based
upon the extent to which the tangible personal property is used in the Village
of North Kingsville.
         (d)    Step 4 - Add the percentages determined in accordance with
Steps 1, 2 and 3, or such of the aforesaid percentages as may be applicable to
the particular taxpayer's business, and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in ascertaining said total. The result so obtained
is the business allocation percentage. In determining the average percentage, a
factor shall not be excluded from the computation merely because said factor is
found to be allocable entirely outside the Village of North Kingsville. A
factor is excluded only when it does not exist anywhere.
         (e)    Step 5 - The business allocation percentage determined in Step
4 above shall be applied to the entire taxable net profits of the taxpayer
wherever derived to determine the net profits allocable to the Village of North
Kingsville.
      (3)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village of North Kingsville, the taxpayer may request, or the
Tax Administrator of the Village of North Kingsville may require, that the
taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer,
an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting (i.e., books and records). If the
Administrator approves the use of books and records as an alternative method,
the following shall apply:
               (a)   The net profits allocable to the Village of North
Kingsville from business, professional or other activities conducted in the
Village of North Kingsville by corporations or unincorporated entities (whether
resident or non-resident) may be determined from the records of the taxpayer
only if the taxpayer has bona fide records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that part of his
activities conducted within the Village of North Kingsville.
               (b)    If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the
basis for apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return
explaining the manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail
to enable the Tax Administrator to determine whether the net profits
attributable to the Village of North Kingsville are apportioned with reasonable
accuracy.
               (c)    In determining the income allocable to the Village of
North Kingsville from the books and records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be
made for the contribution made to the production of such income by headquarters
activities of the taxpayer, whether such headquarters is within or without the
Village of North Kingsville.
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. Such written request
accompanying a tax return or timely filed amended tax return must be addressed
to the Business Manager and shall be attached as the first page of the tax
return or timely filed amended tax return to which it applies. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12(A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(3)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.12(A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(3) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (4)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village of North Kingsville's
tax only if the property generating the net profit is located in the Village of
North Kingsville or if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is
a resident of the Village of North Kingsville. The Village of North Kingsville
shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose
of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal
corporation in which the property is located.
      (5)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the Village of North
Kingsville, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or
broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village of North Kingsville to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village of North
Kingsville shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate
activity on the individual's annual tax return for the Village of North
Kingsville. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on
such net profit to another municipal corporation to the extent that such a
credit is allowed under the Village of North Kingsville's income tax ordinance.
      (6)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (7)    Intentionally left blank. This indicates that stock options are
not exempt from tax.
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of the Village. An employee or
owner may have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable
year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.04 on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   (a)    A taxpayer may elect to apply the provisions of this
division to the apportionment of its net profit from a business or profession.
For taxpayers that make this election, the provisions of division (F) apply to
such apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division.
         (b)    A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division
in writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a
timely filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an
assessment. The election applies to the taxable year for which that return or
appeal is filed and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer
revokes the election.
         (c)    The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax
Administrator of the Village with which, after applying the apportionment
provisions authorized in division (F), the taxpayer is required to file a net
profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to
notify the Tax Administrator of a qualifying remote employee's or owner's
qualifying remote work location is located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise
required to file a net profit return with the Village due to business
operations that are unrelated to the employee's or owner's activity at the
qualifying remote work location.
                   (d)    After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the
election applies to every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts
business. The taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with
the Village solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in the Village.
         (e)    Nothing in this section prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1), all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the election
described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a), the average original
cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote employee or
owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to
that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b), any wages, salaries, and
other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying remote
employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote
work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c), and notwithstanding
division (F)(4), any gross receipts of the business or profession from services
performed during the taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner
for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or
the Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to
all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method as described in division (F). However, the Tax Administrator shall not
require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with solely because a qualifying
remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located in the
Village.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Sections
182.03 and
182.04.
         (Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03 of this chapter, of one and three-tenths percent (1.3%). An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident. This shall be considered to be
a "courtesy withholding”.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand
three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred
dollars ($200.00).
            Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day of
each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment and subsequent payments, based on the Tax Administrator's
determination, may be required to be made by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village.
The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not
affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return
as required under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and the Village as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
      (12)    A person who employs domestic help for such person's private
residence shall not be considered an employer of the domestic for municipal
income tax withholding purposes, and shall not be required to withhold and/or
remit municipal income tax on behalf of the domestic help.
      (13)    Overwithholding of current employees
         (a)    If the overwithholding is discovered in the same month, the
employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the employee and the
amount to be reported as withheld shall be the corrected amount.
         (b)    If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of
the same calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the
employee. In such case, the employer's municipal tax withholding statement for
the month in which the adjustment is made shall reflect the total amount
actually withheld for the month and the amount of the adjustment deducted
therefrom. Also, an amended withholding statement must be filed for the month
in which the error occurred reflecting the adjustment.
         (c)    If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of
the following calendar year, the employee must make and file a request for a
refund. This request is to be filed on a form prescribed by and obtainable from
the Tax Administrator.
      (14)    Overwithholding of former Employees:
                  (a)    In the cases where an amount in excess of the tax has
been withheld from an employee who is no longer employed by the employer, the
Tax Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess withholding to the
former employee.
         (b)    If the error is discovered by the employee, such employee shall
file a claim with the Tax Administrator and upon verification thereof by the
employer, the Tax Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess
withholding to the employee.
      (15)    Insufficient Withholding - If less than the amount of tax
required to be deducted is withheld from the employee and is discovered in the
same year, such deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent wages. If the
employee/employer relationship has terminated, or if the under-withholding is
discovered in a later year and the employee/employer relationship still exists,
the employer shall notify the Tax Administrator of such deficiency and the
reason therefore, and payment shall be made by the employer in conformity with
this section of these rules & regulations.
       (16)    All employers that provide any contractual service within the
Village of North Kingsville, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with
that service, shall provide the Village of North Kingsville the names,
addresses, and Federal ID numbers of the subcontractors. The subcontractors
shall be responsible for all income tax withholding requirements under the
Village of North Kingsville's ordinance.
      (17)   (a)   Employers shall file a list of all 1099-MISC forms issued by
the employer. The list shall include all information contained on each 1099-
MISC form issued.
         (b)    Those employers using Form W-2 furnished commercially may
submit a copy of such commercial W-2.
         (c)   Those employers not using Form W-2 furnished commercially may
obtain forms upon request from the Tax Administrator.

an employer.
         (b)    "Fixed location" means a permanent place of doing business in
this state, such as an office, warehouse, storefront, or similar location owned
or controlled by an employer.
         (c)    "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
            If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the
employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two (2) or
more municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of
days that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those
two (2) or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any
fair and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation
among such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or
sales made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (C)(2)(b) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted

section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on twenty
(20) or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions
applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20)
days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer
to last more than twenty (20) days" if either of the following applies at the
time the services commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty (20) days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than twenty (20) days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the twenty (20)-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in
that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

         (Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer eighteen (18) years of age or older and any taxpayer
that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is
subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
182.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village of
North Kingsville income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a
written exemption from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement
and the entity from which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such
time as the retiree receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village of
North Kingsville, as reported on a federal form W-2 or on federal schedules for
individual business income. The retiree shall then be required to again comply
with all applicable provisions of this ordinance, including all filing
requirements.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village, the return or notice required of that individual shall
be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The Village of North Kingsville shall permit spouses to file a joint
return. Both spouses are liable jointly and severally for payment of the tax
associated with the joint return. A tax return shall be deemed a joint return
whenever the facts indicate that the taxpayers intended to have the filed tax
return be a joint return. Conclusive indications of such intention include when
both spouses have signed the tax return, when the return reports both spouses'
income, or when the return reports both spouses' income but only one signed the
return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less. North
Kingsville shall not require a qualifying employee whose income consists
exclusively of exempt income described in Section
182.02(C)(12)(t)(ii) to file a return under this section.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    (a)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of the
Village's municipal income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any
notice to the taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the
taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due date to file the
return, whichever occurs first.
         (b)    If the Tax Administrator violates division (G)(5) of this
section, the Village shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty dollars.
         (c)    Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2)(a) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
      (7)    The failure of any taxpayer to receive or procure a return,
declaration or other required form shall not excuse him from making any
information return, declaration of return, from filing such form or from paying
the tax.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section,
unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village's income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with the
Village for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
182.04(C)(1)(g)) within the Village.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in the Village and
does not expect to be subject to the Village's income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the Village, make any sales in the Village, or otherwise become subject
to the tax levied by the Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by the Village for the taxable year, the
affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer
with the Village's income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    The date, or prescribed period by which payments or other documents
shall be considered as having been made timely, are as follows:
          (1)    If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
          (2)    If any payment required to be made, and/or any report, claim,
statement, or other document required to be filed, within a prescribed period
or on or before a prescribed date, is delivered after that period or that date
by United States mail to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official to
which the payment is required to be made, and/or to which the report, claim,
statement, or other document is required to be filed, the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the payment, report, claim, statement, or other
document, is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of
payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date
on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   (1)    Each return required by the Village of North Kingsville to be
filed in accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer
may check to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who
prepared the return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return.
      (2)    The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate
that by checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to
contact the preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the
examination or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other
person only to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing
from the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's
refund or payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the preparer or other person.
      (3)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents include the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
ordinance and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

North Kingsville income taxes or to an appeal of the Village of North
Kingsville income tax matters, except as otherwise specifically provided by
law.
      (6)   (a)    The state tax commissioner shall adopt rules establishing:

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension oftime for filing of the return and an extension of time

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181 st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Village before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.

this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in accordance with
this ordinance. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called

(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(l) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.

affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this ordinance on the basis
of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to”
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this ordinance on
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.
   
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January l, 2016.
Application of payments; Currency and Checks.
   (Z)   (1)   If any taxpayer or other debtor owes multiple debts and makes
any single, partial payment to the Village of North Kingsville with respect to
such debts, such municipality shall apply such payment in accordance with the
debtor's directions. Otherwise, the Village of North Kingsville shall apply
partial payments to the taxpayer's oldest unpaid tax debt, then to his oldest
interest debt, and then to his oldest penalty debt.
      (2)    Payments must be made in U.S. currency.
      (3)    Checks:
          (a)    The term "checks" shall include personal checks, bank checks,
money orders and other such instruments for the payment of money which may be
handled as cash items by the Federal Reserve Banks. The payment must be drawn
on a solvent savings & loan or commercial bank or other recognized financial
institution located within one of the twelve U.S. Federal Reserve Districts.
         (b)     If any check or money order in payment of any amount
receivable under these Rules and Regulations, other than those provided for
under (Z)(3)(c) hereof, is not duly paid, there shall be charged to the person
who tendered such check, upon notice and demand by the Tax Administrator, an
amount equal to the processing fee(s) incurred due to the "bad check".
         (c)   If any check in payment of any amount receivable under rules and
regulations, is drawn on a financial institution not located within one of the
twelve Federal Reserve Districts and results in a processing fee charged to the
Village of North Kingsville, there shall be charged to the person who tendered
such check, upon notice and demand by the Tax Administrator, in the same manner
as tax, an amount equal to such processing fee.
            (Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.06 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   (1)    The allowable credit shall be thirty-eight percent (38%) of the
tax rate assessed by this chapter on such net profits, income, salaries,
qualifying wages, commissions or compensation earned in such other municipality
where such tax is paid.
      (2)   The credit allowed to resident individuals for the taxable gains,
if any, on business income for taxable years 2016 and later shall be calculated
as follows:
         (a)    Annual gains and losses from business activities owned by the
taxpayer and earned in the Village of North Kingsville and/or outside the
Village of North Kingsville (collectively known as "jurisdictions") shall be
netted (i.e., offset) in order to calculate the resultant net amount of current
year taxable gains to the Village of North Kingsville.
            If this municipality provides a residence tax credit, either full
or partial and the results of (A)(2)(a) produced a positive net amount of
current year taxable gains, then proceed to section (A)(2)(b) to compute the
allowable credit. Otherwise, no further provisions in this section apply. If
the result is negative no credit is allowed under this section.
         (b)   (i)   Add the current year business net profits from each
jurisdiction that had taxable current year net profits. Do not include in this
total a jurisdiction with current year business activities that resulted in a
net loss for that jurisdiction.
            (ii)     If the taxpayer has multiple business activities in the
current year within one jurisdiction, those business activity current year
profits and losses must be offset to determine that jurisdiction's resultant
current year taxable business net profits, if any. If the offsetting results in
positive taxable income, that jurisdiction is deemed to have "taxable current
year net profits". This offset calculation must be done for each jurisdiction
in which the taxpayer has multiple business activities.
            (iii)    Each jurisdiction which has taxable current year net
profits (either from a single business activity within the jurisdiction, or
after application of (A)(2)(b)(ii)) shall divide that jurisdiction's taxable
current year net profits by the sum of all jurisdictions' current year taxable
net profits determined in (A)(2)(b)(i) and (ii) to determine that
jurisdiction's percentage of the total.
         (c)    The net amount of current year taxable gains determined in (A)
(2)(a) shall be multiplied by each jurisdiction's percentage share calculated
in (A)(2)(b)(ii), and that result shall be multiplied by the respective
jurisdiction's tax rate, if any, to determine the amount of tax paid to that
jurisdiction that may be eligible for credit from the Village of North
Kingsville.
         (d)   The Village of North Kingsville shall then apply the credit rate
(whether 100% or a reduced credit) and any credit limit, as stated in the
Village of North Kingsville's ordinance, to the amount calculated in (A)(2)(c)
for each jurisdiction to determine the amount of credit the Village of North
Kingsville shall allow for purposes of this section.
         (e)    Due to the complexity of this offset provision, the following
example is provided:
   
         Taxpayer is a Riverbridge resident; Riverbridge has a 2% tax rate,
100% credit, 1.5% credit limit.
            Schedule C income earned in Riverbridge $10,000
            Rental loss in Riverbridge ($5,000)
            Partnership income in Carlmont $25,000
            Partnership loss in Carlmont ($50,000)
            Partnership income in Winston $75,000
            Rental loss in Winston ($45,000)
            Rental income in Myertown $10,000
         Total taxable business income after offsets (i.e., gains minus losses)
is $20,000
         Each jurisdiction's Net (gains minus losses):
            Riverbridge $5,000
            Carlmont ($25,000) - only jurisdiction with a net loss
            Winston $30,000
            Myertown $10,000
      Total positive business income (net gains) from 3 jurisdictions - $45,000
         Riverbridge's tax share is 11.11% ($5,000/$45,000) x $20,000 (net
total business income) = $2,222 x 2% (no credit for Riverbridge jurisdiction
income) = $44
         Winston's tax share is 66.67% ($30,000/$45,000) x $20,000 = $13,333 x
2% Winston's rate = $267 potential credit for Winston Jurisdiction.
         Limited credit by Riverbridge of 1.5% for Winston: 1.5% x $13,333 =
$200 (vs $267)
         Myertown's tax share is 22.22% ($10,000/$45,000) x $20,000 = $4,444 x
2% Myertown's rate = $89 potential credit for Myertown Jurisdiction.
         Limited credit by Riverbridge of 1.5% for Myertown: 1.5% x $4,444 =
$67 (vs $89)
      Riverbridge tax due on business jurisdiction income before credits =
$20,000 x 2% = $400
         Minus credit allowed for Winston of ($200)
         Minus credit allowed for Myertown of ($67)
      Total residence tax due, from business activities, to Riverbridge - $133
   (B)    The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)   No credit shall be allowed for county income tax or school district
income tax.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's income tax for
the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars
($200.00). For the purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
(12) months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
182.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, for an
individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the first month of the
following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the
taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
182.05.
   
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve (12) months and the taxpayer filed a return
with the Village under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this ordinance. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents ($0.50) shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any
fractional part of a dollar that is less than fifty cents ($0.50) shall be
dropped. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Village:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three (3) years after the tax was due or paid,
whichever is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file
with the request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for
a refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instrnctions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven (7) days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or ninety (90) days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in Section
182.18 (A)(4).
   (F)    Refunds for days worked out of the Village of North Kingsville are
available only to non-residents, and refunds shall be computed by dividing
total wages by total days worked in order to determine an average daily wage.
The work year shall be considered two hundred sixty (260) days. Saturdays and
Sundays shall not normally be considered workdays. Wage continuation plans of
any type (including, but not limited to, vacation days, holidays, personal
days, and sick days) are deemed to be days spent in the Village of North
Kingsville for purposes of refund calculations. Additions, deletions, or other
changes to the method for calculating refunds shall be at the discretion of the
Tax Administrator.
   (G)    Overpayments will either be refunded or credited to the taxpayer's
current year's liability at his option, except that where taxes are owed for
any previous years overpayments shall be applied in the order in which such
taxes became due before any refund is made or credit granted. Where no election
has been made by the taxpayer, overpayments of any year's taxes shall be
applied as follows:
      (1)   To taxes, penalty or interest owed for any previous years.
      (2)   To his current estimated tax liability (and any excess refunded).
         (Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Village's
tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in
the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to
be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.11 AMENDED RETURNS. 
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a consolidated return to a separate
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return. Nothing in this division shall require the Tax Administrator to
accept such amended returns.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two (2)amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal
or state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Village's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Village return showing income
subject to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village
income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment,
unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the sixtieth day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is

182.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio board of
tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the

   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section
5703.056 of the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last
known address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered
served. If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty (60) days
after the assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local Board of Review within sixty (60) days after the receipt
of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under
division (C)(l)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten (10) days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(l) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local Board of Review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this ordinance.
   (B)    Nothing in this ordinance prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)   The Tax Administrator may consider the following standards when
ascertaining with respect to a claim whether a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement is in the best interests of the Village of North Kingsville:
      (1)    There exists a doubt as to whether the claim can be collected.
      (2)    There exists a substantial probability that, upon payment of the
claim and submission of a timely request for refund with respect to that
payment, the Tax Administrator would refund an amount that was illegally or
erroneously paid.
      (3)    There exists an economic hardship such that a compromise or
agreement would facilitate effective tax administration.
      (4)    There exists a joint liability among spouses, one of whom is an
innocent spouse, provided that any relief under this standard shall only affect
the claim as to the innocent spouse. A spouse granted relief under section 6015
of the Internal Revenue Code with regard to any income item is rebuttably
presumed to be an innocent spouse with regard to that income item to the extent
that income item is included in or otherwise affects the computation of a
municipal income tax or any penalty or interest on that tax. 
      (5)    Any other reasonable standard that the Tax Administrator
establishes.
      
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (F)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. 
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this ordinance is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this ordinance. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this ordinance and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. O-24-017. Passed 4-24-24.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,

opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event

removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;

the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the
transaction. Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the
owner or operator. Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall

303.083 IMPOUNDING VEHICLES ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and

title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(ORC 4513.61)
303.09 LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not

the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
         offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine
established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender
submits to the court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within
ninety days of the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the
additional fine under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

incident, a person may be charged with a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or
(a)(2) and a violation of subsection (b)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these
subsections. (ORC 4511.19)
   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or
urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in subsection
(a)(1)B., C., D. or E. hereof.
            3.   Except as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section, the
person has a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in
subsection (a)(1)J. hereof.
         B.   No person under twenty-one years of age shall be in physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them or while the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in
subsection (b)(1) to (4) hereof.
      (3)   Subsection (d)(2)A.3. of this section does not apply to a person
who is in physical control of a vehicle while the person has a concentration of
a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample isobtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require
the offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the
required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and
satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that comply with
the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the
Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose on the offender any other conditions of community
control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in

         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this
section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The cumulative total of the five consecutive
days in jail and the period of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
continuous alcohol monitoring, or both types of monitoring shall not exceed six
months. The five consecutive days in jail do not have to be served prior to or
consecutively to the period of house arrest.
As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days
required by subsection (h)(1)B.2. of this section, the court, under this
subsection, may sentence the offender to ten consecutive days in jail and not
less than thirty-six consecutive days of house arrest with electronic
monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic
monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The cumulative total of the ten
consecutive days in jail and the period of house arrest with electronic

prior to or consecutively to the period of house arrest.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of thirty consecutive days required
by subsection (h)(1)C.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

by means of flashing, oscillating or rotating lights, as prescribed in Section
337.16, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   If the driver of the motor vehicle is traveling on a street or

Such signs shall be erected and maintained at a distance of at least 100 feet
before each end of such structure.
   (b)   Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of this section,
proof of the determination of the maximum speed and the existence of such signs
shall constitute prima-facie evidence of the maximum speed which can be
maintained with safety to such bridge or structure.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle

name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a) of this section may be admitted into evidence as

under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section.
(ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency. (ORC 4510.04)

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

Municipality for purposes of this section.
 
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
 
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
 
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
 Type of Misdemeanor                         Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

penalty provided in this subsection (c).

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

defining the offense.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,

545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05  or
545.15 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05  or
545.18  do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

(Ord. O-07-019. Passed 6-20-07.)
941.05 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
(a)   Location of Facilities. All facilities shall be constructed,
reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)   Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever excess capacity of the Village exists
within such facility.
      (2)   A Service Provider with permission to install overhead facilities
shall install its facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles
only, and then only if surplus space is available.
      (3)   Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and other
similar facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a Service
Provider with permission to occupy the same Public Right-of-Way with the
electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar facilities, must also
locate its facilities underground.
      (4)   Except for overhead facilities as provided herein, no facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the Village Mayor.
      (5)   The Village reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide excess capacity in the Village in the Public Right-of-Way at the time
of construction, reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of
facilities.
(b)   Excess Capacity Required in the Village. To reduce excavation in the
Public Right- of-Way, it is the Village’s goal to encourage Service Providers
to share occupancy of underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever
possible, excess conduit capacity in the Village for occupancy of future
facilities in the Public Right-of-Way. Therefore, if a Service Provider is
constructing underground conduit in the Public Right-of-Way for its own
facilities, and the Village reasonably determines such construction is in an
area in which other Service Providers would likely construct facilities in the
future, the Village may require the Service Provider to construct the conduit
in the Public Right-of-Way with excess capacity in the Village in the Public
Right-of- Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed for the use of
the excess capacity of the Village by another Service Provider. The Service
Provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the
additional conduit space as reimbursement.
(c)   Village Owned Conduit. If the Village owns or leases conduit in the path
of a Service Provider’s proposed facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible for the Service Provider’s facilities to occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the Village, the Service Provider shall be required to occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the Village in order to reduce the necessity to
excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Service Provider shall pay to the Village
a fee for such occupancy which shall be the cost the Service Provider would
have expended to construct its own conduit, as certified by the Service
Provider’s engineer and approved by the Village Engineer. The Village and the
Service Provider may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments to the
Village.
   (d)   Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, a Service Provider shall, at its own expense,
temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of
any facilities in the Public Right-of-Way whenever the Village shall have
determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably
necessary for:
      (1)   The construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any Village or other public improvement in or upon the Public
Right-of-Way.
      (2)   The operations of the Village or other governmental entity in or
upon the Public Right-of-Way.
   Notwithstanding the above, no Service Provider shall be required to bear the
expense of removal, relocation, change or alteration of position of any
facilities if such requirement would be prohibited by law.
(e)   Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the Village, any Service Provider or other person that
owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized system, facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the Village
or shall arrange to sell the system, facilities or appurtenances to the
Village. After the thirty (30) days have expired, the Village may remove the
facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right- of-Way at the other party’s
expense. A system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Upon revocation of the Service Provider’s consent to occupy or use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (3)   Upon abandonment of a facility in the Public Right-of-Way of the
Village, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and approved by the Village;
      (4)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required construction
permit, except as otherwise provided by this chapter;
      (5)   If the system or facility was constructed, reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the
Village’s consent to occupy or use the Public Right-of-Way or construction
permit;
      (6)   If the Service Provider fails to comply with the registration
requirements of Section
941.03 of this chapter.
(f)   Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The Village retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any facilities, or stop work on any
construction, reconstruction, installation, operation or excavation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the Village, as the Village may determine to be
necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public
health, safety or welfare; except to the extent that the Village’s actions
would cause a dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.

obstruction of, a Public Right-of-Way or closing of a public street.
      (2)   For routine maintenance and new service orders that require the
Service Provider to cause a lane obstruction in a public street for more than
four (4) hours, the Service Provider shall provide the Village with forty-eight
(48) hours advance notice prior to commencing the routine maintenance or new
service order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic
maintenance and indicating how the Service Provider will meet all requirements
of ODOT’s Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable ODOT
regulations.
(c)   Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
emergency work, a Service Provider may commence such emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for emergency work that
requires excavation of a Public Right-of- Way or lane obstruction or closing of
a public street, the Service Provider shall notify the Village as promptly as
possible before commencing such emergency work, or as soon as possible
thereafter if advance notice is not practicable. When notice is required, the
Service Provider shall notify the Village Mayor. (Ord. O-07-019. Passed 6-20-

1111.01 SHORT TITLE.
   This
Title Three of Part Eleven of these Codified Ordinances shall be known and may
be cited and referred to as the "Subdivision Regulations of the Village of
North Kingsville, Ohio," or just "these Subdivision Regulations."
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.02 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of these Subdivision Regulations are:
   (a)    The proper arrangement of streets or highways in relation to existing
or planned streets and highways in the Village;
   (b)    Adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, access of
firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and air; and
   (c)    The avoidance of congestion of population.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-6-79.)
1111.03  INTERESTED GOVERNMENTAL BODIES AND OFFICERS.
   (a)    Village. The Village is interested in the development of subdivisions
that are an asset to the community and that do not require an undue amount of
services that cannot be paid for out of the increase in taxable income to the
governmental body providing such services.
   (b)    Planning Commission. Guidance of land design in a subdivision is a
primary responsibility of the Planning Commission. Land use objectives are
important in considering the development of the land to its highest degree of
utilization.
   The Commission's role as coordinator of the development activities is
important in coordinating the proper officials' review of the proposed
subdivision and certifying the plans in accordance with the laws of the State
governing subdivisions.
   (c)    Council. Council will review a plat for problems relative to the
dedication of streets and public open spaces.
   (d)    Street Commissioner. All plans, profiles and specifications for the
construction of streets and drainage structures shall be reviewed by the Street
Commissioner in order to ensure both soundness of design and conformity with
established standards. The installation and design of permanent monuments shall
also be reviewed by the Street Commissioner.
   (e)    County Health Department. It is important when a subdivision is
proposed that the County Health Department be contacted for a proper review.
The Department may assist in the checking of available potable water supply and
the sanitary sewerage requirement that must be met for the area in which the
subdivision is to be developed. All detailed plans for sewerage systems shall
be approved by the Department to ensure compliance with established standards
and guidelines.
   (f)    County Recorder. The subdivision plat shall be filed with the County
Recorder after it is properly approved.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.04  JURISDICTION.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall be applicable to all subdivisions of
land in the Village.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.05 RELATION TO OTHER LAWS; CONFLICTS.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall supplement all laws, rules and
regulations of the State and municipalities. Whenever the requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations are at variance with the requirements of any other
lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the more
restrictive or that imposing the higher standard shall govern, except as
provided in Section
1111.06.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.06  MODIFICATIONS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   The planned unit development approach to development is greatly encouraged.
These Subdivision Regulations may be modified by the degree necessary to
accomplish the objectives and standards required for the planned unit
development of residential, commercial or industrial subdivisions, or a mixture
thereof. However, nothing in this section shall exempt the developer from the
requirements of subdivision plat approval as specified in Chapter
1115.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.07 AMENDMENTS.
   These Subdivision Regulations may be amended, after public hearings and
other requirements, as specified in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
 
1111.08  SEPARABILITY.
   If, for any reason, any clause, sentence, paragraph, section or other part
of these Subdivision Regulations is decided by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgement shall not affect the validity of
these Subdivision Regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so held to be invalid.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1111.09 POWERS OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapters 711 and 713, the Planning Commission shall
review, approve, conditionally approve and disapprove plats and minor
subdivisions according to rules, standards and criteria outlined in these
Subdivision Regulations.

1117.01  INTENT; RESPONSIBILITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   This chapter shall control the manner in which streets, lots and other
elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land. These design controls shall
help ensure convenient and safe streets, the creation of usable lots, the
provision of space for public utilities and the reservation of land for
recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for reviewing the design of
each future subdivision early in its design development. The Commission shall
ensure that all of the requirements of this chapter are met
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.02 CONFORMITY TO MAJOR THOROUGHFARE PLAN AND ZONING
CODE.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares, or extensions thereof, shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare
Plan. Thoroughfares not contained in the Plan shall conform to the
recommendation of the Planning Commission based upon the design standards set
forth in Section
1117.04. In addition, no final plat of land within the area in which the Zoning
Code is in effect shall be approved unless it conforms with such Zoning Code.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.03 DEVELOPMENT OF UNSUITABLE LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding, bad drainage,
topography, inadequate water supply, schools, transportation facilities and
other such conditions which may endanger health, life or property, and if, from
investigations conducted by the public agencies concerned, it is determined
that in the best interest of the public the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for subdivision
unless adequate methods are advanced by the subdivider for solving the problems
that will be created by the development of the land.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.04 STREETS.
   (a)    Generally. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade,
construction and location of all streets shall conform to the Major
Thoroughfare Plan of the Village, or subsequent amendments thereto, and shall
be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical
conditions and public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation
to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. The street
pattern shall discourage through traffic in the interior of a subdivision. The
subdivider shall provide, within the boundaries of the subdivision plat, the
necessary right of way for the widening, continuance or alignment of such
streets in conformity with the Major Thoroughfare Plan.
   (b)    Cul-de-Sacs and Loop-Type Local Streets. The design and improvement
standards contained in Table I, following the text of Chapter
1121, are suggested minimums for cul-de-sacs and loop-type local streets in
residential subdivisions. All such streets shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with the standards specified in Chapter
1121.
   (c)    Collector Streets. The design and improvement standards contained in
such Table I are suggested minimums for all collector streets. All such streets
shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards specified in
Chapter
1121.
   (d)    Intersections.
      (1)    Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two
streets shall be avoided.
      (2)    Four-way intersections of local streets should be avoided and
three-way or T-intersections should be encouraged wherever possible.
   (e)    Special Street Types. The following requirements shall apply to
special street types:
      (1)    Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-
end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan, and
only if a temporary turnaround, satisfactory to the Planning Commission in
design, is provided, and if provisions for maintenance and removal are
advanced.
      (2)    Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
      (3)    Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street shall be designed, if the subdivision design is such that residential
lots would require direct vehicular access onto the arterial street. Points of
access to the arterial street shall be spaced at a minimum of 1,320 feet. A
planting strip having a minimum width of twenty feet shall be provided between
the pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access
street. The minimum width of the marginal access right of way shall be sixty
feet.
      (4)    Alleys shall not be approved in residential subdivisions, except
where justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in commercial and
industrial districts if other provisions cannot be made for adequate service
access. The minimum widths for alleys shall be twenty feet for the right of way
and eighteen feet for the pavement width.
   (f)    Streets for Commercial Subdivisions. Streets serving business
developments and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local streets. The
intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible interference with
traffic movement on the streets, shall be located not less than 100 feet from
the intersection of an arterial or collector street with any other street and
shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each other. The Commission may
require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.
   (g)    Streets for Industrial Subdivisions. Collector streets for industrial
subdivisions shall be planned to serve industrial areas exclusively and shall
connect with arterial streets so that no industrial traffic will be directed
into any residential street. The intersections of service streets from parking
areas with arterial or collector streets shall be not less than 100 feet from
the intersection of the arterial or collector street with any other street.
Streets shall be planned to be extended to the boundaries of any adjoining land
planned for industry, except for severe physical conditions or if the
Commission finds that such extension is not in accordance with the approved
plan of the area.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.05 BLOCKS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of blocks:
   (a)    The arrangement of blocks shall conform to the street planning
criteria set forth in this chapter. Blocks shall be arranged to accommodate
lots and building sites of the size and character required for the district, as
set forth in these Subdivision Regulations or the Zoning Code, and to provide
for the required community facilities.
   (b)    Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Planning Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance
of interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
   (c)    No block shall be longer than 1,500 feet and the block width shall
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where unusual topography or other
exceptional physical circumstances exist.
   (d)    Where blocks are over 900 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width at or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary, to provide proper access to schools, recreational areas, shopping
centers and other facilities. The same type of easement may be required
elsewhere as the Planning Commission deems necessary.
      (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.06 LOTS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots:
   (a)    The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development.
   (b)    All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
Subdivision Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district
in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
   (c)    Each lot shall front on a publicly or privately dedicated
thoroughfare. The minimum lot size, width and setback shall be as specified in
Section
1117.10.
   (d)    All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where the Planning Commission determines
that a variation to this rule would provide a better layout.
   (e)    Through lots are not allowed.
   (f)    No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy-five feet.
   (g)    No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three times its
average width, nor shall it have a depth of less than 120 feet. However,
whenever a lot fronts upon an exterior curved portion of a street, the
centerline radius of which is 100 feet or less, the required minimum lot depth
may be reduced to not less than 100 feet.
   (h)    All lots fronting on a newly dedicated road shall not include any of
the road right of way within the legal description.
      (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.07  EASEMENTS.
   Easements along rear, front or side lot lines shall be provided where
necessary for sanitary sewers, gas mains, water lines and electric lines.
Easements shall also be provided along every watercourse, storm sewer, drainage
channel or stream within a subdivision. If work is required within an easement,
the person doing such work shall be held responsible for returning the grounds
to its original form and/or condition.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.08 FLOOD HAZARD AREAS; SOIL AND DRAINAGE CONDITIONS.
   In order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people,
the Planning Commission shall reject any proposed subdivision located in an
area subject to periodic flooding. If the subdivision is located in an area
having poor drainage or other adverse soil characteristics, the Commission may
approve the subdivision, provided that the subdivider agrees to perform such
improvements as will render the area safe for the intended use. In lieu of
improvements, the subdivider shall furnish a surety or certified check covering
the cost of the required improvements.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1117.09 PUBLIC SITES, OPEN SPACES AND NATURAL FEATURES.
   Where a park, playground, school or public access to water frontage which is
shown in the Comprehensive Development Plan is located in whole or in part in a
proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission shall request the dedication of
such area within the subdivision. The subdivider shall pay for only that
portion of the cost of the public site that benefits his or her subdivision as
determined by the Commission. Every subdivider of land for subdivisions not
containing public sites shall be requested to provide land or payment in lieu
thereof for that portion of benefits from public sites accruing to his or her
land as determined by the Commission. The Commission shall, wherever possible,
establish the preservation of natural features which add value to residential
developments and to the community, such as large wooded areas, watercourses,
beaches, areas of historical significance and similar irreplaceable assets.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)

or extension of an existing street, its name should be the same as that of the
existing street.
   (d)    Whenever a street alignment changes direction more than seventy-five
degrees without a return to the original alignment within a distance of 500
feet, the name of the street may be changed at the point of curvature.
   (e)    Whenever a cul-de-sac street serves not more than three lots, the
name of the intersecting street should apply to the cul-de-sac.
   (f)    To avoid duplication and confusion, the proposed names of all streets

(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1119.04 STREET LIGHTS.
   The subdivider may install street lights. The Street Commissioner will
review all street lighting plans.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1119.05 STREET TREES.
   Trees may be provided by the subdivider, but they shall be of species which
are resistant to damage and disease and which do not cause interference with
underground utilities, street lighting or visibility at street intersections.
Existing trees should be retained wherever possible. All trees shall be planted
outside the street right of way.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1119.06 WATER.
   Where a public water supply is not available, the subdivider shall supply
evidence (well logs) of the availability of underground water. The subdivider
may be required to make one or more test wells in the area to be platted if
such evidence is deemed unacceptable. Copies of well logs which are obtained
shall include the name and address of the well driller and shall be submitted
to the Planning Commission. The developer shall install water mains that comply
with current Federal, State and local regulations to ensure proper Village fire
protection.
1119.07 STORM SEWERS AND STORM WATER DRAINAGE.
   Where an adequate public storm sewer is available at the plat boundary, the

1119.11 OFF-SITE EXTENSIONS OF UTILITIES.
   If utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed subdivision,
and if the Planning Commission finds that extensions across undeveloped areas
would not be warranted as a special assessment to the intervening properties or
as a Municipal expense until some future time, the subdivider may be required,
prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain necessary easements or right of
ways and construct and pay for such extensions. Such improvements shall be
available for connections by subdividers of adjoining land with sharing of the
costs.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)

1121.01 AUTHORITY OF STREET COMMISSIONER.
   The Street Commissioner shall act as an agent for the Planning Commission.
The rules and regulations found in this chapter are the jurisdiction of the
Street Commissioner. No variances to regulations found in this chapter will be
permitted without the approval of the Street Commissioner. The Street
Commissioner's decision will be based upon consultation with and agreement by
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.02 GENERAL REGULATIONS.
   The following rules and regulations shall apply to the construction of road
and drainage improvements:
   (a)    Submission Fees. Before any construction is authorized, a complete
set of construction drawings will be presented for review and approval. The
review fee will be one cent ($0.01) per linear foot of roadway. A ten dollar
($10.00) fee will be the minimum amount for this service. No approval will be
granted until all fees are paid.
   (b)    Construction Schedule. After approval of the construction drawings by
the Street Commissioner, and before starting any construction work, the
developer shall submit a construction schedule at a preconstruction meeting to
the Street Commissioner for approval. The construction schedule shall show
starting and completion dates for each phase of the construction work,
including a date for the completion of the entire project.
      During the progress of the work, upon recommendation of the Street
Commissioner, Council may revise the project completion date given in the
construction schedule, but is not obligated to do so. Changes in the
construction schedule will be granted, in writing, on written request therefor.
   (c)    Inspections. Two days before the start of each phase of the
construction, the developer shall notify the Street Commissioner's office of
the starting date so that arrangements can be made for an inspection, if
necessary.
      Failure to notify the Street Commissioner's office may result in the
Street Commissioner requiring the developer to remove the uninspected work and/
or a penalty again the developer.
      The Street Commissioner will determine the amount of the inspection,
including laboratory and/or other tests required to ensure that the developer
and his or her contractors will comply with the specifications and approved
drawings. The tests shall be paid for by the developer.
   (d)    Inspection Fees. At the time of a preconstruction meeting, the Street
Commissioner will determine an amount, based on the construction cost estimate,
to be escrowed for the purpose of payment of inspection services throughout the
project. This fund shall be deposited in a bank in the County and made payable
to the Village. The agreement shall also commit the developer to make
additional deposits to such fund, when requested by the Street Commissioner,
for the cost of inspection services, in addition to that covered by previous
deposits. The balance remaining in this fund will be returned to the developer,
without interest, upon final acceptance of the work by the Village.
      The developer shall pay the actual wage, salary or contract cost of the
inspection service, plus an amount to cover such items as employee benefits,
engineering service and transportation. All inspection fees shall be paid
before final acceptance of the improvements by the Street Commissioner.
   (e)    Estimated Costs. Upon approval of the construction drawings by the
Street Commissioner, and before starting any construction work, the developer
shall submit to the Street Commissioner for approval and estimated cost, by
item, for surveying and engineering, inspections and construction of roads,
storm sewers, drainage structures, underground utilities and erosion control.
   (f)    Performance Bond. Before starting any construction work, the
developer shall furnish a performance bond in an amount equal to 100 percent of
the approved total estimated cost of the improvements. The performance bond
will remain in effect until released by Council.
      In lieu of a performance bond, the developer may present a statement from
an accredited lending institution. This statement shall verify the fact that
the developer has secured a loan and that money has been escrowed by the bank
for the specific purpose of funding the stated improvements.
      The developer and the lending bank shall sign an agreement to the
following conditions:
      (1)    The developer or his or her engineer shall approve all invoices
and statements of expenditures and submit them to the Street Commissioner.
After review, the Street Commissioner will submit the invoices and statements
of expenditures to Council for approval.
      (2)    Within ten days after approval by Council, the lending bank shall
pay the approved invoices and statements.
      (3)    No payment shall be withheld beyond a ten-day period without
consent of Council.
      (4)    If the developer fails to complete the project on or before the
project completion date or revised completion date as set forth in the
construction schedule required by subsection (b) hereof, Council may elect to
manage the remaining funds to complete the project in accordance with approved
drawings and specifications. When Council considers that the developer has
failed in his or her duty to complete the project, it will notify the developer
and lending bank, in writing, of such failure and of its intention to complete
the project.
   (g)    Maintenance Bond. Upon completion of the improvements and conditional
acceptance by Council, the developer shall furnish a maintenance bond in the
amount determined by the Street Commissioner to ensure that the developer shall
correct all construction defects or failures and shall make repairs as
necessary to restore the completed improvements to a good condition for final
acceptance by Council.
      The improvements will be eligible for final acceptance one year after the
conditional acceptance, but the maintenance bond shall remain in effect until
final acceptance by Council.
      In lieu of a maintenance bond, the developer may establish a fund in the
amount designated for the maintenance bond. This fund shall be deposited in a
bank in the County and made payable to the Village. No expenditure may be made
from this fund without the approval of Council. Upon final acceptance of the
improvements, the balance remaining in the fund will be returned to the
developer without interest.
      The developer shall furnish proof that after the improvement has received
final approval, it will fall into a regular maintenance program. This can be by
an agreement that an association or corporation will be formed for the purpose
of regulating and maintaining improvements that would not ultimately be
accepted for maintenance by any other governmental body.
   (h)    Insurance. The developer shall agree to indemnify and save harmless
the Village against and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and
expense on account of damage to property of, or injury to or death of, any of
its employees, agents or representatives or any third person, caused by,
growing out of or in any way attributable to the construction of such
improvements and the use of the street delineated on the subdivision plat
during construction. The developer shall further agree, but without limiting
its liability to indemnify the Village, to carry liability insurance contracts
with any insurance company acceptable to Council during the period of such
construction in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) to three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for injury to or death of a person, and in
the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for damage to or destruction
of property, which insurance contracts shall include the Village as a named
insured. The developer agrees to maintain on file with the Village, during the
period of such construction, certificates or memoranda of insurance evidencing
that such insurance contracts are in force.
   (i)    Inspection for Conditional and Final Acceptance.
      (1)    Upon completion of the improvements, the developer shall make a
request to the Street Commissioner for an inspection for conditional
acceptance. After the inspection the Street Commissioner will do one of the
following:
         A.    Issue a letter to Council, with a copy to the developer,
recommending conditional acceptance and the amount of a maintenance bond; or
         B.    Issue a letter to the developer, with a copy to Council, listing
items of work necessary to accomplish satisfactory completion of the
improvements.
         After the listed work items have been completed, the developer shall
again request an inspection.
      (2)    One year after conditional acceptance, the developer shall, after
restoring the improvements to a good condition, make a request to the Street
Commissioner for an inspection for final acceptance. After the inspection the
Street Commissioner will do one of the following:
         A.    Issue a letter to Council, with a copy to the developer,
recommending final acceptance of the improvements; or
         B.    Issue a letter to the developer, with a copy to Council, listing
items of work necessary to accomplish before the recommendation for final
acceptance can be made.
After the listed work items have been completed, the developer shall again
request an inspection.
         (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.03 QUALIFICATIONS OF SURVEYORS AND ENGINEERS.
   Only surveyors and engineers registered in the State shall be employed for
surveying and engineering.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.04 MONUMENTS; MARKERS; HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL CONTROL.
   (a)    Concrete markers shall be accurately set and established at the
intersections of all outside boundary lines of the subdivision. They should be
thirty-six inches in length and six inches in diameter, whether square or
round. The center point should be accurately marked with an iron pin set in the
concrete. It should be one-half inch in diameter and cast in at least one foot
of the concrete marker. Where the subdivision consists of blocks of ten or more
sublots, the Street Commissioner may direct the developer to have concrete
markers at the corners of such blocks.
   (b)    Iron pin markers shall be at least five-eighths of an inch in
diameter and two to three feet in length, depending on soil conditions. Where
larger diameter pins are used, a center point should be marked. Iron pin
markers shall be used to mark sublot corners, p.c., p.t. and p.i. points on
street centerlines, street intersection points and deflection points on
centerline.
   Iron pins should also be set on the right-of-way lines at p.c. and p.t.
points. Where streets are not to be paved, iron pins should be set eight to
twelve inches below the finished grade. Where streets are to be paved, the
engineer may require that iron pins be enclosed in monument boxes, such as
Neenah Foundry R-1968 type 36D adjustable or equal. Monumentation of the plat
should be shown on the final drawings. The County Engineer will review such
drawings and direct monuments to be set so that all lines of the plat may be
conveniently re-established. Monuments and markers shall be in place before
final approval of the plat. Where final approval is requested before markers
are set, the Street Commissioner will ask that money be escrowed to cover the
cost of setting monuments.
   (c)    On any plat where new streets are to be established, the Street
Commissioner will ask that horizontal control be established by Polaris
observation and that all lines of the plat will show true bearing or angles to
true bearing.
   (d)    To facilitate future construction of drainage systems, the Street
Commissioner will ask that vertical control be established. This shall be done
by running a balanced level circuit from the nearest U.S.G.S. bench mark. A
true elevation shall then be designated and shown on at least three of the
concrete corner markers.
   (e)    It is intended that in all cases these requirements will fulfill the
minimums outlined in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.05 CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS.
   The following items pertain to construction drawings:
    (a)    Preparation; Form. All construction drawings shall be prepared in
ink on twenty- four inch by thirty-six inch sheets of mylar film or imperial
linen tracing cloth. A title block shall be included in the lower right corner
of each sheet. If more than three sheets are required, a title sheet showing
subdivision roads, the subdivision location and bar scales on all sheets shall
be used.
      The professional engineer responsible for the preparation of the
construction drawings shall affix his or her registration stamp to each sheet.
Some subdivisions will not require all the drawings set forth in subsections
(b) to (h) hereof. In case of doubt, request a decision from the Street
Commissioner.
   (b)    Drainage Drawings. The developer shall make a complete study of the
drainage area affecting the subdivision and prepare a topographic drawing to
show the area draining into each pipe or drainage structure. Each area shall be
outlined and have the number of acres shown on the drawing.
      The subdivider shall construct all necessary facilities, including
underground pipes, inlets, catch basins or open drainage ditches, as determined
by the Street Commissioner, to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface
and surface water and for the maintenance of natural drainage courses. The
velocity of flow in an open ditch shall not exceed four feet per second in soil
ditches or six feet per second in turf gutters. Protection against erosion will
be required if velocities of flow are greater than those specified or if it is
otherwise likely that destructive erosion will result. Drainage ditches shall
not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewerage facility.
      The developer shall submit copies of all data and calculation sheets to
the Street Commissioner. Methods used to determine run-off and structure size
shall be indicated, for approval by the Street Commissioner.
   (c)    Drainage Structures. The developer shall submit detail drawings for
all bridges and other drainage structures (other than standard culvert pipe
without headwalls) to the Street Commissioner for approval. Design load shall
be shown on the drawings.
   (d)    Road Plans and Profiles. The developer shall prepare plans and
profiles of all roads on standard plan and profile sheets, with the plan at the
top and the profile at the bottom one-half. Use one inch equals fifty feet for
the horizontal scale and one inch equals five feet for the vertical scale.
      The plan portion of the sheet shall show the road centerline, stations,
road names, sublot lines, right-of-way lines, pavement, curbs, gutters, storm
and sanitary sewers and structures, bridges, culverts, underground utilities,
guardrails, trees and other obstructions within the right of way, p.c., p.t.
and p.i. locations, curve data and construction notes. The profile portion of
the sheet shall show centerline stations, bench marks with descriptions and
elevations, original ground profile on centerline and set-back lines, proposed
profile grade, vertical curve data, sight distance (300 feet minimum from a
height of four and one-half feet), storm and sanitary sewers and structures,
bridges, culverts and notes.
    (e)    Typical Section. The developer shall include a typical section on
the plan profile drawings or as a separate drawing to show design elements of
the road construction. The developer shall select information for the typical
section from the typical sections included at the end of these specifications.
    (f)    Cross-Section Drawings. If required by the Street Commissioner, the
developer shall submit cross-section drawings on standard cross-section sheets.
These shall show cut and fill computations. The horizontal and vertical scales
shall be one inch equals five feet.
   (g)    Dams. If a dam, being part of the subdivision, is to be constructed,
the developer must comply with the following:
      (1)    If the dam is sufficiently large, i.e. when the height from the
natural stream bed to the spillway level is ten feet or greater, or when the
product of the storage capacity of the impoundment at spillway level in acre-
feet and its height in feet are greater than 1,000, a permit must be acquired
from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water.
      (2)    If a construction permit is not required from the Ohio Department
of Natural Resources, then four copies of detailed drawings of the proposed dam
shall be submitted to the Street Commissioner for approval. It is recommended
that where small dams are being constructed, the Soil Conservation Service be
contacted. This agency is in a very good position to advise of local soil
conditions and construction details.
      No road shall be built across a dam without approval from the Street
Commissioner.
   (h)    Special Construction. The developer shall include detail drawings of
special construction, such as headwalls, concrete aprons, rip-rap and other
construction, not otherwise included.
      (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.06 GENERAL CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   All construction pertaining to roads, drainage and underground utilities
shall conform to the latest edition of the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation Construction and Material Specifications except as modified or
otherwise specified in this chapter.
   These specifications, including attached drawings, are for average to good
soil conditions. Where, in the opinion of the Street Commissioner, soil
conditions are below average, the Street Commissioner may require a soil study
and adjustments in design to conform to the conditions. The Street Commissioner
may also require adjustments in design to conform to the special conditions
inherent within a particular subdivision, including, but not limited to,
swamps, quicksand and landslides.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.07 GEOMETRIC DESIGN OF ROADS.
   The geometric design of roads in subdivisions shall conform to the
following:
   (a)    Right-of-Way Widths. All right-of-way widths shall conform to widths
shown in Table II following the text of this chapter. The right of way shall be
cleared of all organic material and other obstructions for the full width and
depth sufficient to remove objectionable materials, unless otherwise approved
by the Street Commissioner.
   (b)    Pavement Width. The pavement width for each road class shall be as
shown in Table II and in the typical sections included in these specifications
   (c)    Shoulders, Ditches and Slopes. Shoulders, ditches and slopes shall be
as shown in the typical sections included in these specifications.
   (d)    Street Intersections. Not more than four road legs will be permitted
at any intersection. Road intersections should be at ninety degrees where
practical, but in no case less than seventy-five degrees. Each intersecting
road shall have a tangent distance of at least eighty feet for local roads and
130 feet for collector and marginal access roads, measured from the centerline
of intersections. Roads intersecting another road shall have a minimum offset
of 125 feet. Roads entering arterial roads from the same side shall be 1,000
feet apart, measured between centerlines. The minimum radius of right-of-way
lines at intersection corners shall be thirty feet for local roads and fifty
feet for all other roads
   (e)   Horizontal Alignment. Between reverse curves, there shall be a minimum
tangent of 100 feet. See Table II for the curve radius.
   (f)    Vertical Alignment. Grades of roads shall not exceed six percent. The
minimum grade for all roads shall be 0.35 percent and the minimum grade for
road side ditches shall be 0.50 percent. Simple parabolic vertical curves shall
be used to effect a gradual change between tangent grades where the algebraic
difference of grades is greater than 0.40 percent.
   (g)    Permanent Turnarounds. Cul-de-sac streets shall terminate in a
permanent circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way line radius of
sixty-five feet. The outer edge of the pavement shall have a minimum radius of
fifty feet, but not greater than the right-of-way line radius less fifteen
feet. The minimum pavement width of a turnaround shall be sixteen feet.
   (h)    Temporary Turnarounds. Where temporary turnarounds are permitted,
tee-type turnarounds shall be constructed. They shall be constructed so that
the legs of the tee extend at ninety degree angles to the roadway to the limits
of the right of way. The legs shall have a width of thirty feet. They shall be
constructed to the same standards as allowed on all other portions of roads and
so as not to impede road drainage.
   (i)    Sidewalks. Where sidewalks are proposed, the sidewalks shall be
constructed one foot inside the right of way and shall be not less than four
feet in width and four inches in thickness. Where sidewalks cross driveways,
the minimum thickness shall be six inches.
   (i)    Ornamental Construction. If the developer elects to install a
decorative fence or other ornamental construction within the right-of-way
limits, he or she shall show such construction on the plan and profile drawings
or submit separate drawings for approval by the Street Commissioner.
      (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.08 ROAD CONSTRUCTION.
   Road construction shall include the following items:
   (a)    Subgrade. The subgrade shall be graded and shaped as shown on the
typical cross- sections included with these specifications for the type of road
being built. All soft areas shall be removed and replaced with material
suitable for compaction. Backfills over sewers, culverts and underground
utilities shall be compacted by vibratory tamping in six-inch layers. If and
where indicated by the Street Commissioner, French drains shall be installed
and led to the side ditches or connected into storm sewers.
   (b)    Paving. Road paving in subdivisions shall conform to or exceed the
minimum width and thickness for each road class given in Table I following the
text of this chapter. All new construction and resurfacing shall be laid with
full road width paving equipment and rolled with a ten to twelve ton roller.
   (c)    Surface Course. Upon the expiration of an agreed maintenance period
for the base course, a surface course shall be constructed using asphaltic
concrete, bituminous mix or Portland cement concrete. Specific materials and
thickness recommendations shall be determined by the Street Commissioner based
on traffic density and weight.
   (d)    Curbs. Curbs will not be required. If the developer elects to install
curbs, he or she shall conform to the standard drawings included in these
specifications or submit complete detail drawings of the curbs, inlet basins
and storm sewers to the Street Commissioner for approval. Where curbs are used,
the pavement width shall be four feet wider than required without curbs.
   (e)    Shoulders. Shoulders shall have a minimum width of six feet and shall
be shaped as shown on typical cross-sections included with these
specifications. Where curbs are used, shoulders shall be seeded and mulched. On
residential light traffic roads without curbs, the shoulders may be either
seeded and mulched or stabilized with gravel, slag or limestone as shown on
typical sections. On collector, marginal access and commercial and industrial
park roads without curbs, the shoulders shall be stabilized with limestone as
shown on typical sections. A minimum of three inches of top soil should be used
on seeded shoulders.
   (f)    Ditches and Slopes. Ditches and slopes shall be shaped as shown on
typical cross- sections, except that the depth of ditches shall be increased
where necessary to obtain the minimum grade of 0.50 percent for drainage. All
ditches and slopes shall be seeded and mulched in accordance with the State of
Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications. A
minimum of three inches of top soil shall be used to ensure a good growth of
grass. Where ditch grades are greater than three percent or attain a velocity
of four feet per second on soil and six feet per second on turf, the ditches
shall be protected against water erosion. No. 1 or No. 2 stone may be used in
the bottom of ditches for erosion protection up to a five percent grade. For
over a five percent grade, riprap shall be used. Tile may be used for erosion
protection instead of the stone and rip-rap. Ditches may be tiled with
vitrified sewer pipe (with a minimum cover of one foot), concrete pipe or
corrugated metal pipe.
   (g)    Drive Pipe. Drive pipe shall be double wall plastic pipe with smooth
interior or reinforced concrete. All pipes shall be twelve inches in diameter
and at least twenty feet long. Approval of type, size and length shall be
obtained from the Street Commissioner. The developer shall be responsible for
having all drive pipes in the subdivision in good condition for final
acceptance of the roads, even if the drive pipes were installed by the home
owners. Replacement drive pipe is required to be purchased by the land owner.
All stone and labor for replacement installation shall be done by the Street
Department for a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
      (Ord. O-05-066. Passed 11-6-05.)
   (h)    Drives. All drives sloping downward from the property to the road
shall be constructed so that all surface water will drain into ditches and not
onto the traveled portion of the road.
      (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79; Ord. O-98-034. Passed 8-19-98.)
1121.09  BRIDGE AND SPECIAL DRAINAGE STRUCTURES.
   Bridge and special drainage structures shall be constructed in accordance
with the construction drawings approved by the Street Commissioner.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.10 STORM SEWERS, MANHOLES AND CATCH BASINS.
   (a)    Where curbs are installed, storm sewers with curb inlets will be
required in accordance with the standard drawings included with these
specifications. Where there are no curbs and storm sewers are used in roadside
ditches, there shall be a swale or depression over the sewer draining to inlet
basins spaced not more than 150 feet apart. At all driveways there shall be an
inlet basin on the high side of the drive pipe so that water does not flow
across the drive. Storm sewers or other approved means of erosion control shall
be installed in ditches or creeks running through subdivisions where the water
flow exceeds six feet per second.
   (b)    Storm sewer manholes shall be not more than 300 feet apart. Vitrified
sewer pipe or concrete pipe will be satisfactory for storm sewers. Vitrified
sewer pipe shall have a minimum earth cover of one foot. The minimum diameter
of storm sewers shall be twelve inches. The installation of storm sewers,
manholes, inlets and catch basins shall conform to construction drawings
approved by the Street Commissioner or to the standard drawings included in
these specifications. All storm sewers shall empty into drainage courses shown
on approved drainage drawings or as approved by the Street Commissioner.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.11 GUARDRAILS.
   Guardrails shall be required where the Street Commissioner deems that the
height of roadways or slopes, or physical obstructions, make guardrails a
necessity. Guardrails shall be deep beam. The developer shall submit details to
the Street Commissioner for approval. Bridge guardrails may be a deep beam type
of a guardrail, built integrally with the bridge.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.12  UTILITIES.
   All utilities, or the proposed placement thereof, shall be shown on the
construction drawings. All construction of utilities and appurtenances shall
conform with current regulations of the State Public Utilities Commission and
the local public utility involved.
   Copies of construction drawings may be furnished to the proper utility
company so the design of these plans may be shown. The general rules of road
crossing and underground installation for all Village roads shall apply, as
established by the Street Commissioner.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.13  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES; STREET NAME SIGNS.
   (a)    All traffic control devices, i.e. signing and lighting, shall conform
to the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices of Ohio. The placement and
warrants for such devices will be, likewise, governed by these standards.
   (b)    Street name signs shall be placed at all street intersections.
   (c)    Where roads or streets intersect existing public highways, the
developer will be responsible for the initial installation of traffic control
devices. Thereafter, maintenance will be the responsibility of the governmental
body within whose jurisdiction this falls.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.14 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   When the developer intends to remove or dislocate natural topsoil, trees and
other vegetation, or where the developer intends to change the surface contour
of a proposed subdivision, he or she shall discuss the intended work with the
Street Commissioner. The Street Commissioner will then determine if plans for
erosion and sedimentation control are required.
   The plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall be governed by the
guidelines and policies established by the Ashtabula Soil and Water
Conservation District. Technical assistance from this organization will be
available to the developer. The developer may be asked to submit three sets of
plans for erosion and sedimentation control to the County Engineer for
approval. The Street Commissioner will forward one set of plans to the
Ashtabula Soil and Water Conservation District for its comments and will return
one set to the developer marked approved or disapproved with a request to
revise and resubmit for approval.
   In general, erosion and sedimentation control work will consist of, but not
be limited to, grading, soil preparation, fertilizing, seeding and mulching as
necessary to establish a sufficient growth of grass or other ground cover that
will prevent damage to subdivision areas and to adjoining properties. The
Street Commissioner will have the work inspected to the extent that he or she
determines necessary to ensure that the developer will comply with the approved
plans.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.15  PRECONSTRUCTION MEETING.
   (a)    It will be the developer's responsibility to make arrangements for a
preconstruction meeting. All interested parties should be invited to attend.
These include:
      (1)    The Street Commissioner or his or her agent;
       (2)    The developer and the developer's engineer;
      (3)    The contractor and his or her project supervisor;
       (4)    Public utility companies involved; and
       (5)    A representative of the Planning Commission.
   (b)    The meeting should cover the following:
      (1)    A general plan review;
      (2)    A statement from the contractor outlining his or her construction
schedule; and
      (3)    A statement by each utility involved.
         (Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79.)
1121.16  INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is hereby declared to be the intent of Council that the provisions of
this chapter will result in improvements that are well planned, with good
engineering practices, and that the completed work will serve the public for
years to come. It would not be feasible to outline all engineering
technicalities that any particular improvement may involve. Therefore, any rule
or engineering standard not mentioned, or arbitrary decision, will be
discussed, and the Street Commissioner's decision will be final.

A collector road connects a local road with an arterial road.
A marginal road is parallel to a freeway or arterial road and provides access
to local roads.
A residential light traffic road is a dead-end road, less than three-fourths of
a mile in length, including a side street.
A residential medium traffic road is a dead-end road, greater than three-
fourths of a mile in length, including a side street, or a road passing through
a residential area but out of line of through traffic.
Commercial and industrial park roads are roads in subdivisions having
commercial and/or industrial enterprises served by trucks.
In case of a question, the Street Commissioner will decide on the road class
for construction purposes.
Pavement width for all road classes is for roads without on-street parking. Add
ten feet in width for each parallel parking lane if the road is designated for
street parking.
(Ord. 143.221. Passed 11-5-79. )

requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1333.01 APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   The Village is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located in the Village, where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), unless
there is compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 143.517. Passed 9-2-86.)
1333.02 PAYMENT OF PERCENTAGE OF PROCEEDS TO VILLAGE.
   When the loss agreed to between a named insured or insureds and a company or
companies equals or exceeds sixty percent of the aggregate limits of liability
on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the insurance company
or companies, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F), shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief, in the aggregate, one thousand dollars
($1,000) for each twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), and each fraction of that
amount, of a claim, or if, at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between a
named insured or insureds and an insurance company or companies, the named
insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs
of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure, the company
or companies shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate.
   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the Village shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate of
the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the Fire Chief shall return the amount of the fund in
excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the City
has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
(Ord. 143.517. Passed 9-2-86.)
1333.03 DISPOSITION OF MONEYS.
   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Village, as authorized by Section
1333.02, the Fire Chief shall place the proceeds in a separate fund, to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing
incurred by the Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   When transferring the funds, as required by Section
1333.02, an insurance company shall provide the Village with the name and
address of the named insured or insureds, whereupon the Fire Chief shall
contact the named insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been
received by the Village and notify them that the fund will be returned to the
named insured or insureds when repair, removal or securing of the building or
other structure has been completed, the required proof has been received by the
Fire Chief and the Village has not incurred any costs for such repair, removal
or securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be paid from
the fund. If excess funds remain, the Village shall transfer the remaining
funds to the named insured or insureds. Nothing in this chapter shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Village to recover any deficiency under
Ohio R.C. 715.261, nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to prohibit
the Village and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement
that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some
other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
(Ord. 143.517. Passed 9-2-86.)
1333.04 AUTHORITY OF FIRE CHIEF.
   The Fire Chief is hereby designated as the officer authorized to carry out
the provisions of this chapter. The Fire Chief shall file a certified copy of

1337.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of North Kingsville, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of North Kingsville has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve
the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
North Kingsville as identified in Section
1337.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
North Kingsville.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Ashtabula County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas effective August 28, 2019 Flood Insurance Study for
Ashtabula County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas effective August 28, 2019
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of North Kingsville as required by Section
1337.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 3541 East Center Street, North Kingsville, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements,
covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another
ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of North Kingsville, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. O-19-038. Passed 8-5-19.)
1337.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

one-hundred (100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)
The water surface elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum,
usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,

assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
The agency with the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood
Insurance Program.
Fill
A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally
dry land areas
from:
   (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)
Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting
approximate special
flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development has delineated the areas of special
flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones
Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood
hazard in
specific areas of a community. Following are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any given year;
with flood depths of one to three (1 to 3) feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
   Zone AH:

the 100- year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone Band Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   Zone V
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year flood from velocity

   Zone VE and Vl-30
Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year from velocity hazard
(wave action); base flood elevations are determined.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official report in which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the
U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway
boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
Floodproofing
Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures
which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real
property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
Flood Protection Elevation
The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation. In areas
where no base flood
elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
Floodway
A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that have
been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is
typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis
such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base
flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall the
designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard
A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute
to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood
and floodway conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings,
debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure
Any structure that is:
   1.    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   2.    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as
a registered historic district; or
   3.    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
4.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained by
North Kingsville's historic preservation program, which program is certified by
the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of
Ohio, in accordance
with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine
flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC)
A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend
or revise effective
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood
Insurance Studies.
LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
   1.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
      A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends
the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific
property is not located in a special flood hazard area.
   2.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
      A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes,
shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by
fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
   3.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
      A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon
construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding
source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway,
the effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR
does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA)
A line shown on a Flood Insurance Rate Map to indicate the inland limit of the
one and five tenths feet (1.5-ft) breaking wave height during the base flood.
Lowest floor
The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition
excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood
resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement
area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable
design requirements
specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest floor.
Manufactured home
A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is
designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the
required utilities.
The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Mean sea level
For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a
community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
Manufactured home park
As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01 (K), a manufactured home park
means any tract
of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or
enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
Moderate Wave Action Area (MoWA)
A special flood hazard area subject to the potential for breaking wave heights
of greater than or equal to one and five-tenths (1.5) feet, but less than three
(3) feet, where the primary source of flooding is storm surges, seiches. A MoWA
is an area within zone AE on a FIRM that is between the inland limit of zone VE
and a Limit of Moderate Wave Action, where identified. (Also known as "Coastal
A Zone").
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the
community as a financial protection against flood loss.
New construction
Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the
effective date of a
floodplain regulation adopted by North Kingsville and includes any subsequent
improvements to
such structures.
For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM (December 18, 2007)
and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures.
Person
Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership,
association, or any other
entity, including state and local governments and agencies. An agency is
further defined in the
Ohio Rev. Code § 111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state
college or university, community college district, technical college district,
or state community
college. "Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board,
the adjutant
general's department, or any court.
Recreational vehicle
A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less
when measured at the
largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently
towable by a light
duty truck, and ( 4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect
A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to Ohio
Rev. Code §4703.01
and 4703.19.
Registered Professional Engineer
A person registered as a professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Registered Professional Surveyor
A person registered as a professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code
Chapter 4733.
Special Flood Hazard Area
Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain
subject to a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard
areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance
Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as
Zones A, AE,
AH, AO, Al-30, A99, or V, VE. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to
areas that are flood
prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
Start of construction
The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The actual state means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
Structure
A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage tank
that is principally
above ground.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to the
'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value
of the structure
before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction"
of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred
"substantial damage,"
regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however,
include:
   1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
   2.    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration
would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic
structure".
Variance
A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with
these regulations.

its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that [COMMUNITY'S NAME] flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1337.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1337.03(k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of North
Kingsville, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of North Kingsville have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the Village of North Kingsville's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent
the Village of North Kingsville boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village of North Kingsville suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
of North Kingsville has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1337.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final food
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, Al-30, AH, AO, VE, and Vl-30:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
            3.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where
none had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in
lieu of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1337.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or Vl-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
      Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures
to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair
process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1337.03(k)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of North Kingsville and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1337.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
North Kingsville specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1337.03(k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (j)   Development standards for coastal high hazard areas [and MoWA areas].
The requirements of Section
1337.04(j) apply to development in coastal high hazard areas designated zone V
or VE on the community's effective FIRM [and when designated on a preliminary
or final FIRM issued by FEMA under the circumstances provided in Section
1337.03(m)].
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated
on pilings or columns that may be armored as necessary to withstand Lake Erie
ice forces so that:
         A.   The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting
the lowest floor ( excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to or above
the flood protection elevation, and
         B.   The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is
anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the effects
of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components.
            1.   Water loading values shall be those associated with the base
flood.
            2.   Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-13 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or current version adopted by Ohio
Board of Building Standards.
            3.   A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop
or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the construction,
and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to be used are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of
Section
1337.04(j)(1)A. and B.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
         A.   For the purpose of Section
1337.04(j)(2), a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of
not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot.
         B.   Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot ( either by design or where so
required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all
of the following conditions:
            1.   Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less
than that which would occur during the base flood; and
            2.   The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation
system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all
building components (structural and non-structural). Water loading values shall
be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values shall be those
defined according to American Society of Civil Engineers 7-16 Minimum design
loads and associated criteria for buildings and other structures, or equivalent
standard.
         C.   All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood lattice-work, or
insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage.
      (3)   The use of fill or redistributed existing fill, placed after the
initial identification of Zones V, VE or Vl-30 on the community's FIRM, for
structural support of buildings is prohibited.
      (4)   Alteration of sand dunes that will increase potential flood damage
is prohibited.
      (5)   Placement or substantial improvement of manufactured homes must
comply with Section
1337.04(j)(1) through (5).
      (6)   Recreational vehicles must either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
         C.   Comply with Section
1337.04(j)(1) through (5).

1337.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village Council shall appoint an Appeals Board. Meetings of the
Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the call of the
Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All meetings of the
Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board may deliberate
in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in accordance with the
law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote
of each member upon each question and shall keep records of all official
actions.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed at 3541 East
Center Street, North Kingsville, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1337.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within ten [10] days of the date of such notice
and order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the
appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest, and decide the appeal
within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement
of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance. 
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1337.05(d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 2506. (Ord. O-19-038. Passed 8-5-15.)
1337.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1337.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1337.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1337.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village of North Kingsville. Each day such
violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Village of North Kingsville from taking such other
lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village
of North Kingsville shall prosecute any violation of these regulations in
accordance with the penalties stated herein.
